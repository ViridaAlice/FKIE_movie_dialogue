I got different ways, but in this case I'll probably go full on - separate the head from the body and do what I call a bayou burial. You know the Bayou Gauche?\nPerson B: Well, my family has land out there, so, late at night, I'll drift in undetected, drift out in a little boat, and let the alligators take it from there.\nPerson B: Body. Head... Head is a different story. Head means teeth. And teeth are a fuckin' problem.\nPerson B: Well, I find a spot in the middle of nowhere, a stick of dynamite in the mouth...BOOM. No more teeth, no more problem.\nPerson B: I can tell you're very thorough in your thinking, which is good. Now, in case the headless, uneaten body is discovered, which has never happened with me, but, yeah, no more fingertips, I would have already removed those, and dispersed them separately. Sounds kind of weird, but I've got a ritual. So, I divide the number of miles by the number of fingers, so when I'm driving out to the location, in this case 50 miles...I roll down the window, toss one out every 5 miles or so.",
