So, now I'm here, with you.\nPerson A: Believe me, I want to, but we're going through a divorce right now and I'd be the number one suspect. So, I need the perfect front, the perfect alibi.\nPerson A: What's it to you? I forgot to mention, it might be a twofer. She's got this new boyfriend... a real douche.\nPerson A: And, if he's there, you can take him out too.\nPerson A: When you do it, I want her to know why. Right before you do it, look her in the eye and say \"this is from your loving husband.\" I want that to be the last thing she fuckin' hears.",
