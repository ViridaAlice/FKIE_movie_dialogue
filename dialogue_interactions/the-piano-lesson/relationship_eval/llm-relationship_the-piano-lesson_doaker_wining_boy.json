I was down in Kansas City and she wrote and told me Cleotha had died. Name of Willa Bryant. They was nailing her coffin shut by the time I heard about it. I never knew she was sick. I believe it was that yellow jaundice. That\u2019s what killed her mama.\nPerson A: Cleotha wasn\u2019t but forty-some.\nPerson B: She was forty-six. You remember I used to run around there. Couldn\u2019t nothing keep me still. Much as I loved Cleotha I loved to ramble. Couldn\u2019t nothing keep me still. We got married and we used to fight about it all the time. Then one day she asked me to leave. Told me she loved me before I left. Told me, Wining Boy, you got a home as long as I got mine. And I believe in my heart I always felt that and that kept me safe.",

You look up one day and you hate the whiskey, and you hate the women, and you hate the piano. But that\u2019s all you got. You can\u2019t do nothing else. All you know how to do is play that piano.
