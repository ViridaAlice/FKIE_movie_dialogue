It\u2019s less than I thought it would be.\nEDDIE: Well it\u2019s less because less shows.\nSHELLY: Well, I know that, obviously, but I thought it would just be eight hundred divided by eleven shows a week, minus the three shows we lost.\nEDDIE: You might have been making slightly more for the ones we lost cuz those shows were better sold. Generally.\nEDDIE: If you want I can check with accounts payable?\nSHELLY: Nah, it\u2019s okay. They\u2019re not gonna do anything about it, right?",
