From there we went by train to Mashhad to visit Imam Reza\u2019s shrine. We definitely had to take pictures there. Because when we came back, everyone from the village would come to our house, and in short, it was very important for them to see our photo in the shrine of Imam Reza. On the other hand, photography was not allowed in Imam Reza's shrine. But some photographers had a large painting of the shrine, in front of which the pilgrims would stand and take pictures. We also went to one of these photo shoots and stood like this and took a photo.",
