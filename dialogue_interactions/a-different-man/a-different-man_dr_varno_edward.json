Several other tumors have shown mild enlargement but no impingement on any important structures, so...just some things we have to keep an eye on.

This drug seems to have the potential to be - we don\u2019t like to use the words \u201cmiracle drug\u201d but - I shouldn\u2019t overpromise anything, because I don\u2019t know the details, but - reverse the - words like \u201cheal\u201d and \u201ccure\u201d are anathema to folks in my profession but - to actually heal you. Completely, even. So I took the liberty of telling him about you and he\u2019s rather desperate to meet you. The implications are...life-changing -- for you.",
