There\u2019s obviously an element of danger, as you were made fully aware of prior to your participation. All we can do is monitor closely and use our experience as a guide, but I\u2019d say this is cause for excitement. This is beyond our wildest expectations. You\u2019re a part of medical history. You may be the subject of a documentary one day.\nEDWARD: If I\u2019m not in the control group.\nDOCTOR FLEXNER: Don\u2019t waver, Mr. Lemuel. And if at all possible, I\u2019d like for you to photograph yourself - say a dozen times a day - just so we can monitor the rate of change, which appears to be rapid. Reasonable? Perhaps the risk is worth the reward? Something to think about.",
