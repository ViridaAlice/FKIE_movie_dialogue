I still remember she looked at me and said, Mom,] I just want you to know that I hate you...I feel so hurt. [And then, she ran away. She was gone for three days. I was so scared. Then, one day, she just came home. She didn\u2019t talk to me. Wouldn\u2019t look at me. But I was so happy...] [Compared to her, you are not as stubborn. So I knew you would come home.]\nPerson A: [Didi, you know. Sometimes I sit and think about how I ended up here. Just an ordinary housewife. And it is true. I do wonder sometimes...is this it? What would my life be like if I didn\u2019t marry your father and have you and Vivian. Would I be happier? Maybe now I would be a successful artist in New York City with my own studio and gallery. I allow myself to dream. But then, as soon as I see you, I know - this is where I want to be. Didi, being your mother is really difficult, but getting to watch you and Vivian grow up here, make friends, and learn so many things I can\u2019t teach you, I realize...you are my dream.] I\u2019m so proud. [But with your dad not around, and Nai Nai always criticizing me for how I raise you and Vivian - sometimes it\u2019s really too much. And sometimes I think...maybe I failed as a mother. But I know - no matter what - I must do my best to love you both. That is my duty.] But it is a little hard.",
