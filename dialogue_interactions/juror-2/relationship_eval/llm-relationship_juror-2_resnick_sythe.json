I figured the best thing to do was to leave, and we'd work it out the next day like we always did.\nPerson B: Did I say some things to her I didn't mean? Yeah. Am I guilty of not always being the greatest boyfriend? Sure. Of not moving forward as fast as she wanted to because I was stupid? Absolutely. But I'd never hurt her. I loved Kendall with all my heart. And I know what you see when you look at me. But I left that life behind. I'm not that guy anymore.",
