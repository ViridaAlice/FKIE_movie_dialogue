Medicine men use it in their work. A Columbian scientist, whose name escapes me, isolated from Yage a drug he called Telepathine. I read all this in a magazine article.\nPerson B: Later, I see another article: the Russians are using Yage in experiments on slave labor. It seems they want to induce states of automatic obedience and ultimately, of course, \u201cthought control.\u201d The basic con. No buildup, no spiel, no routine, just move in on someone\u2019s psyche and give orders. I have a theory the Mayan priests developed a form of one-way telepathy to con the peasants into doing all the work. The deal is certain to backfire eventually, because telepathy is not of its nature a one-way setup, nor a setup of sender and receiver at all.\nPerson B: By now, the U.S. is experimenting with Yage, unless they are dumber even than I think.
