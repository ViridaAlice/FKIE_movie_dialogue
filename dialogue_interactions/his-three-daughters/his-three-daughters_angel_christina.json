His cancer is very advanced, and when we are in pain, our bodies naturally try to fight it, even if it\u2019s actually just hurting us more. His ease will possibly quicken the process, in an organic way. That\u2019s really the big difference between hospice and hospital care, which aims to extend life. As painless as possible is our goal, always. But another thing is, it\u2019s not just our bodies that affect the time it takes to pass. I can\u2019t tell you the science on this, but in the twelve years I have been working in hospice, it has become very clear to me that the mind is just as big a factor as the body. And that is really where you can be a huge help, in case he is holding on, not wanting to go out of fear. You can help in letting him know, reassuring him, that it\u2019s okay. The mind doesn\u2019t have power to heal or reverse the disease, not at the stage it is. But if he knows it will be okay, that you all will be okay, it could mean a great deal.
