EMT cracked the ribs of my close friend\u2019s mother, almost all of them, trying to bring her back after she had just about passed peacefully. The poor lady was left brain dead for another three weeks, completely broken and bruised, and that\u2019s not something my father wants. When he goes, he should be allowed to go.

In most of this country, at this time, even if it is asked for by the patient. The only way to do that, is to make a mistake. For it to be unintentional. Maybe someone didn\u2019t measure the amount correctly. Sometimes, if the amount is just over, it can be lethal. I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know. But, mistakes have been made. And accidents are natural, right?\nPerson B: I\u2019m sorry that he was in pain. I understand how terrible that must have been for you to witness. But, here he is, with you, and not in a hospital.
