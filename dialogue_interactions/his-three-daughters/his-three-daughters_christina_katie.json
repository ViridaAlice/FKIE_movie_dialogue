Hard to tell whether he\u2019s in pain, I mean at least while he\u2019s asleep. But you\u2019ve been on top of that, yes? Because I think that\u2019s the thing, is for it to be as painless as possible. The trick is, I guess the thing I\u2019m saying, is that I hope we can make this easy, on him. Just not make a thing out of anything. If we disagree, we talk it out without getting heated, or yelling, or anything that\u2019s going to upset him. We handle it like adults, like the age we are. I don\u2019t really see what there is to disagree about, anyways. At the end of the day, the hard truth is, is that he\u2019s dying and there\u2019s nothing either one of us can do to stop that from happening. I\u2019m not trying to be cold, but it\u2019s a matter of being there for him, being here. Things from the past don\u2019t matter, not right now. If there are things to work out, they can wait. I really hope you agree. I\u2019m upset. I know you are too. We all are. It\u2019s hard. It sucks. Let\u2019s not make it harder, ok? I did see...I did see that the DNR never got signed like I asked. Quite a few times. I got it, it\u2019s not that easy...well it was easy, actually. And now, it\u2019s a lot harder\u2014I\u2019m not making this a thing\u2014 I\u2019m just saying it\u2019s harder now that he\u2019s not seeing doctors.",

I\u2019ve seen too many movies, probably. Especially the ones made for children, with Mirabella, these past couple years. Everything so nice, bright. Even if they get heavy, there\u2019s a beauty and clarity to it all. This feels so real...I\u2019m rambling, I\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s the jet lag. I get even more emotional when I fly.
