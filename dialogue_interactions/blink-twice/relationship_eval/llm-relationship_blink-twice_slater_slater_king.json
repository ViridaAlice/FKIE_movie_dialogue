I mean, this is amazing. You're amazing. You inspire me! You make me think bigger. Imagine what humans can do if we were just free from our trauma. Oh, this is gonna be great. Like, my sister. She's so fucked up, cuz she remembers everything. \"How could you play tennis with that man after everything he did to us when we were little?\" And I'm over here like, \"What'd he do?\" You know this was never about sex right? This is about creating a safe space. Where we can learn about ourselves. With no judgement, no shame. Because There is no past. No future. Just me and you. Right here. Right now. And you came back. You didn't leave me. Let's Start fresh. What do ya think?",
