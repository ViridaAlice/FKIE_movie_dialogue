Sometimes I swear they don\u2019t realize I have a life and would rather be home with you guys than typing up reports at 11pm on a Thursday from my hotel room.\nPerson A: I thought you hated Book Babies?\nPerson B: Oh I do. It was an accident, truth be told, but he loved it.\nPerson A: You\u2019re still alive, ya ol\u2019 furball?\nPerson B: She is the cat who will never die. Even though nobody really pays any attention to her anymore. Baby, no! Don\u2019t chase the cat.\nPerson B: Speaking of furballs - I\u2019m like... I don\u2019t know.\nPerson A: What?\nPerson B: No. I shouldn\u2019t have brought it up. I\u2019m just having some odd side effects maybe of perimenopause? I\u2019m not sure. Weird hair sprouting up?\nPerson A: You talking about your nipples?\nPerson B: No! Lower back. And kind of my toes too. I don\u2019t know. I just feel off. I feel like I have this heightened sense of smell - kind of like when I was pregnant. The cat\u2019s butt smells disgusting to me.\nPerson A: That\u2019s not just you.\nPerson B: And my teeth seem to be getting sharper. Look!\nPerson A: Oh yeah. Definitely. Your teeth look so weird. This is real and not in your head.\nPerson A: I\u2019m sorry, but honey you always think something is wrong with you.\nPerson B: Well, that\u2019s the thing about being a hypochondriac - one day I will be right! And then you\u2019ll be sorry.\nPerson B: I can\u2019t remember the last time I washed this shirt. *\nPerson A: I never washed any of my clothes * for all of college. You\u2019re just * like a bachelor.\nPerson B: I mean, it\u2019s just like... what\u2019s the point? I always hated hard pants. I\u2019m giving in to just a soft- pants lifestyle.\nPerson A: You\u2019re living the dream.\nPerson B: I\u2019m the housewife I never wanted to be! You know what\u2019s the hardest part? It\u2019s like I\u2019m on suicide watch and I can\u2019t look away for even a second. Or he might stick a fork into a light socket, or like walk off a cliff. Why does he want to kill himself? It\u2019s so much more mentally exhausting than I expected.\nPerson A: It\u2019s better than leaving him with those awful ladies at the awful daycare, right?\nPerson B: I guess. That was heartbreaking.\nPerson B: If you wake him up I will rip your throat out.\nPerson A: I thought this is what you wanted. No more long hours at the gallery and crying while you pumped your boobs in a bathroom.\nPerson B: I did, I do. But maybe I need to find a part-time job or something? So I don\u2019t lose my mind.\nPerson A: It\u2019s just the math doesn\u2019t totally add up. The likelihood of you making more than we would have to pay a sitter-\nPerson B: I know. And there aren\u2019t really part time gallery jobs. Or part time nannies.\nPerson A: Right.\nPerson B: Maybe when he starts school.\nPerson A: Yeah. You just gotta hold on till Kindergarten.\nPerson B: Then I think - how dare I complain? What a gift - to get to be with my baby all day long. I should be grateful- on the scale of people who have things to complain about I\u2019m at the bottom. I\u2019m just a fucking privileged white lady who gets to stay home and make cookies all day.\nPerson A: Do you make cookies?\nPerson B: Not once.\nPerson A: I would kill to get to stay home with him every day, for what that\u2019s worth.\nPerson B: You think that. But I can assure you, you would not.\nPerson B: HEY! His fucking binky! Do you not hear him? The husband wakes, totally confused, and she turns her back * to them to let him figure it out. He fumbles and puts the * binky back in his son\u2019s mouth, who quiets.\nPerson A: Did you make coffee?\nPerson B: Not yet - will you do it?\nPerson A: Uh... sure. Is it two scoops?\nPerson B: I do three.\nPerson A: So, last night... you were kind of a-\nPerson B: Bitch?\nPerson A: You said it not me.\nPerson B: Yep. Night bitch. I am Nightbitch.\nPerson B: I sort of said it like that so that he could see I\u2019m a good sport. I\u2019m not like uptight, or not able to poke fun at myself. But once I said it, I knew the horrible truth. Nightbitch has always been there.\nPerson A: What\u2019s next?\nPerson B: Bath time.\nPerson A: I\u2019ll do it. Let\u2019s go little dude.\nPerson B: Thank you.\nPerson B: He is a good man. He is. He wasn\u2019t always so literal and cut off-",

I need to get some toys at my place. He was so bored. And maybe a stuffy or something?\nPerson B: That\u2019s a good idea. I\u2019ll send you the link for that dinosaur he loves. You could get him one for your place. And I\u2019ll pack more for him too.\nPerson A: Okay yeah.\nPerson A: He\u2019s really sweet. But he\u2019s also not used to me. I kinda felt like he thought he\u2019d been kidnapped.\nPerson B: That will change. This is gonna be good for both of you.\nPerson A: He\u2019s like \u2018who is this weird man living in this sad apartment complex with all the other sad men?\u2019 I swear the whole place is newly divorced dads. All these kids at the pool kind of just confused - not a mom in sight.\nPerson B: I just picture all the kids getting sunburned because nobody remembers the sunscreen.\nPerson A: Oh man, I didn\u2019t even think of sunscreen.\nPerson B: See you Friday?\nPerson A: Yep.\nPerson B: Okay! What do we want to do today? I missed you so much.\nPerson B: May we pet your dog?\nPerson B: We love dogs!\nPerson B: That one?\nPerson B: May we chase your dog?\nPerson B: It\u2019s so cool right?\nPerson B: You know that I love being your mom, right?\nPerson B: It makes me so happy. You are a wonderful kid.\nPerson B: I want to go back and grab you by the shoulders...\nPerson B: ...And scream at you \u2018you\u2019re amazing! You\u2019re my mother!\nPerson B: Go to Europe. Insist on your joy! Time is short...\nPerson B: ...Don\u2019t just do it for you, do it for me too!\u2019\nPerson B: I always thought motherhood was sort of a weak state of being - like very basic and passive. But motherhood is a far more primal active thing than that.\nPerson B: It is probably the most violent experience a human can have aside from death itself.\nPerson B: A child\u2019s first act is violence against the woman who created it. Yet still the mother loves the child with the most powerful love known in this universe. Miriam is a wild boar, Liz is a moose. And Norma is there as a wise owl.\nPerson B: This thing comes from us. It rips its way out of us, literally tears us in two, in a wash of blood and shit and piss.",
