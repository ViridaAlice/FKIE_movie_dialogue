That's eleven square feet, If we can afford these materials at all, Mr. Van Buren, Sylacauga Marble ships out of Talladega County and that might be possible if I manage to swing some favors but I can't make any promises.\nLASZLO: Afford these materials? The concrete is sturdy and cheap.\nLESLIE WOODROW: The concrete- it's not very attractive. Perhaps you'd like to split the difference on materials?\nLASZLO: Fortunately, the building's aesthetic is not yours to resolve, Mr. Woodrow. And Sylacauga marble is white like a sheet of paper; it's nothing. What I have here is blue and grey with softer veining.",
