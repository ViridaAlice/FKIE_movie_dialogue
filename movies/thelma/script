      INT. THELMA’S CONDO - OFFICE - AFTERNOON
Light streams in to illuminate a wood paneled office. Full
but neat. A lifetime of tchotchkes encompass the shelves but
all surfaces are meticulously ordered.
THELMA (93) sits at her desk, finger outstretched toward her
computer screen. She is tough and elegant in her old age. She
wears a wide-necked, flowy silk blouse.
Her grandson DANIEL, somehow washed up at (24) but an all￾star grandson, peers over her shoulder, lovingly assisting.
DANIEL
What are you looking for?
THELMA
Bobby’s email.
DANIEL
Scroll up--
THELMA
I’m scrolling.
DANIEL
You’re not scrolling. Look, this is
scrolling.
Daniel scrolls through her emails, they begin to rush by.
THELMA
Okay, wait! Wait...
DANIEL (CONT’D)
What?
THELMA (CONT’D)
Stop fussing with it.
She scans the emails with her finger. Like a phone book.
THELMA (CONT’D)
What’s this?
DANIEL
This is an ad for Neiman Marcus.
THELMA
Get rid of it.
DANIEL
You don’t have to trash it, it can
just stay in your inbox.

THELMA
Who needs it?
(then)
What’s an inbox?
Daniel patiently tries to explain. Thelma patiently tries to
understand. This isn’t their first rodeo.
DANIEL
It’s... where all of your emails
are stored. Like a folder on your
computer with all of your emails.
THELMA
And what is a computer?
DANIEL
...This is a computer--
THELMA
I know this is a computer but what
is it really? How does it function?
DANIEL
It’s-- let’s come back to that.
Thelma agrees. Daniel searches for the email. Thelma watches
intently. He finds it.
THELMA
Yes, there!
A FEW MINUTES LATER - in a lingering two shot, Daniel and
Thelma listen to an old, crackly audio file (from the 1960s)
on her computer. A man croons “Some Enchanted Evening” as a
baby coos in response. Thelma listens, transported.
The camera drifts over to a picture of Thelma and her late
husband TED. The recording continues to play under...
TITLE CARD: A floral needlepoint canvas. The hand stitched
text at the center reads “THELMA.”
INT. THELMA’S CONDO - VARIOUS - A LITTLE LATER
We cycle through shots of Thelma’s condo. The faint diegetic
rumblings of an intense action sequence can be heard over
serene tableaus of the carefully maintained space.

INT. THELMA’S CONDO - DEN - CONTINUOUS
We locate the source of the sound as a TV screen fills the
frame: Mission: Impossible - Fallout plays as Tom Cruise runs
in a long uninterrupted take.
THELMA (O.S.)
Pretty fast.
DANIEL (O.S.)
Very fast. He’s like sixty.
THELMA (O.S.)
It’s not a stunt man?
DANIEL (O.S.)
No, that’s the whole thing. He does
it all himself.
THELMA (O.S.)
Wow. Terrific.
REVERSE ON our pair, lounging on the couch. Daniel watches
Thelma watch Tom, glancing intermittently up at the screen
and back down at her needlepoint.
THELMA (CONT’D)
What’s with you? Big plans tonight?
DANIEL
Nah, just dinging around...
THELMA
Have you spoken to Allie?
Daniel shifts his weight.
DANIEL
We’re still on a break. I’m trying
to give her a little space... And
just not really sure what my
selling points are at the moment.
THELMA
Psh! You’re a wonderful grandson.
You know computers. You have your
hair.
DANIEL
I think it’s gonna start to go
early.
THELMA
You can’t get hung up on that.

DANIEL
We’re just in different places...
as people, you know? She’s thinks
I’m stuck.
It’s clear Daniel agrees.
THELMA
You’re too young to be stuck.
DANIEL
I don’t feel young.
THELMA
I don’t feel old.
DANIEL
Oy.
THELMA
Oy is right.
They chuckle. Then settle...
THELMA (CONT’D)
You’re gonna land on your feet.
Like Cruise. Who is it they say
lands on their feet?
DANIEL
That’s cats. But in a way it could
be about both.
INT. THELMA’S CONDO - BEDROOM - A LITTLE LATER
Thelma shuffles through the contents of a mid-century
secretary desk. Daniel lingers a few feet behind, eyeing her
balance nervously. She pulls out a marble.
THELMA
You want this? It’s a marble. I
have a ton of these.
DANIEL
Sure.
She closes up the desk.
THELMA
You want pretzels? I have a ton of
pretzels.

DANIEL
Only if you don’t need--
THELMA (CONT’D)
Take them! I can’t chew them.
She hands him a oversized tub of pretzels. Daniel grabs her
LYFE LINE bracelet off the bedside table.
DANIEL (CONT’D)
Can you please wear this when I go?
THELMA
I’m fine.
DANIEL
You probably won’t need it but I’ll
feel better if you wear it. Okay?
THELMA
What’s the point? If I fall, I’m
toast. That’s why I don’t fall.
Daniel bristles at her candor.
DANIEL
Don’t say that. Come on-- please?
For my mental health?
THELMA
...Only for my guardian angel!
DANIEL
Thank you! Just a precautionary
measure.
He secures it around her wrist.
DANIEL (CONT’D)
What’s your plan for the day?
THELMA
Eh, the usual.
INT. THELMA’S CONDO - BATHROOM
On a tile countertop, Thelma meticulously orders her
medications for the week.
INT. THELMA’S CONDO - VARIOUS - LATER
Thelma tidies various surfaces, adjusting objects in small
ways, creating slightly more symmetrical displays.

INT. THELMA’S CONDO - DEN - LATER
Thelma dons bifocals as she needlepoints a floral pillow
cover. The news blares on her TV as she works.
INT. THELMA’S CONDO - OFFICE - LATER
AT HER COMPUTER, Thelma watches a video embedded in an email
from her friend Herman. He’s singing karaoke against a
psychedelic screensaver. Thelma chuckles, overjoyed.
THELMA
Oh my god...
She nudges the cursor toward “reply” and eventually clicks
it. She slowly and deliberately begins to type her response.
INT. THELMA’S CONDO - LIVING ROOM - LATER
Thelma crosses the expansive living room on foot. It’s
vaguely treacherous but she shuffles across the space with
confidence and familiarity.
INT. THELMA’S CONDO - KITCHEN - LATER
Thelma makes an afternoon coffee. She itches the area where
the Lyfe Line bracelet grates on her wrist. She removes it
and places it on the counter.
INT. THELMA’S CONDO - OFFICE - LATER
Thelma sips her coffee as she chips away at her response to
Herman. She’s gotten a few words down now but she’s made a
spelling error. She struggles to backspace.
INT. THELMA’S CONDO - BEDROOM - LATER
Thelma, seated in a chair, gets a little exercise in on a
mini pedal bike at her feet. We hang in a wide as she pedals.
INT. THELMA’S CONDO - DEN - LATER
Thelma peruses Instagram on her iPhone. She sees a photo of
Daniel, attempts to “like” it but takes a blurry picture of
her den and posts it instead.

INT. THELMA’S CONDO - OFFICE - LATER
Thelma’s in the home stretch on her email to Herman. It
reads: “Wonderful. Thank you for sharing.! Broughghht me a
smile.” Good enough. She clicks send.
INT. THELMA’S CONDO - KITCHEN - LATER
Thelma listens to a VOICEMAIL on her machine. A kind elderly
voice crackles through--
BEN (V.O.)
Hiya, Thel. Ben here. Looks like I
missed you again. I read a terrific
article about mangos I thought you
might enjoy. They seem to have many
wonderful properties... not sure if
you’d be interested but I found it
interesting and thought of you. Be
well, doll. If you need anything,
you know where to find me.
Beep. She furrows her brow, annoyed, and erases the message.
INT. THELMA’S CONDO - BATHROOM - NIGHT
Thelma, now wearing a loose white nightgown, removes her
hearing aids. And everything GOES QUIET.
INT. THELMA’S CONDO - BEDROOM - LATER
Light from the TV illuminates the room. It’s presumably loud
but we can only hear the muffled hum. Like we’re underwater.
Thelma approaches the edge of her noticeably high bed. She
turns her back to it, then THROWS HERSELF onto it. From
there, she tucks herself in. All part of the routine.
INT. THELMA’S CONDO - OFFICE - MORNING
The TV blares per usual as she needlepoints. Her cell phone
rings - the sound feeds directly into her hearing aids via
Bluetooth. It’s loud.
She swipes elegantly on her iPhone, pinky outstretched, until
she manages to open her HEARING AIDS APP. She adjusts the
volume. Better.
The contact: UNKNOWN CALLER. She picks up.

UNKNOWN CALLER (O.S.)

Grandma!
THELMA
I’m sorry, hello--
UNKNOWN CALLER (O.S.)
(muffled)
Grandma! It’s me. Can you hear me?
Thelma perks up.
THELMA
Danny?
UNKNOWN CALLER (O.S.)
I got into an accident.
Her breath quickens. She rises swiftly and begins to pace.
THELMA
What are you saying? You got into
an accident? What happened?!
Nothing. Then--
UNKNOWN CALLER (O.S.)
I’m in jail.
THELMA
You’re in jail? Oh my god! Wha--
UNKNOWN CALLER (O.S.)
(rambling, muffled)
I hit a woman-- she was pregnant. I
don’t know what’s happening but
they’re holding me here.
THELMA
...You sound so strange, do you
have a cold?
UNKNOWN CALLER (O.S.)
I have a broken nose! The airbag
went off...
Now she’s starting to panic.
UNKNOWN CALLER (O.S.) (CONT’D)
You’re gonna get a call, okay? It’s
a defense attorney. He’s going to
bail me out but you need to send
him the money. (MORE)

I’m so sorry, I can’t believe this
happened. He’s going to call you--
Thelma’s phone vibrates - another UNKNOWN CALLER.
THELMA
Someone’s calling now--
UNKNOWN CALLER (O.S.)
That’s him, pick it up--
She ends the call and answers the other line.
SOMEONE speaks, his voice is comforting but firm.
SOMEONE (O.S.)
Hello? Ms. Post?
THELMA
Hello! Yes! This is Thelma Post. My
grandson Danny Markowitz was, uh,
involved in an accident of some
kind. He has a broken nose--
SOMEONE (O.S.)
Danny Markowitz, you said?
THELMA
Yes! Daniel Markowitz. Daniel
Alexander Markowitz.
SOMEONE (O.S.)
...Okay. I see the file here.
THELMA
What do you need? What can I--
SOMEONE (O.S.)
Don’t worry, ma’am. We’re going to
handle this. I’m going to need you
to mail $10,000 to this address--
THELMA
$10,000? Oh my god--
SOMEONE (O.S.)
Can you drive to the post office?
Thelma is starting to tear up, overwhelmed.
THELMA
I don’t drive anymore. I don’t have
a car.

SOMEONE (O.S.)
Then how about a cab? And remember,
it has to be cash. We don’t want
him sitting in there any longer
than he has to. I’m going to give
you the mailing address. Are you
ready?
INT. THELMA’S CONDO - VARIOUS - MOMENTS LATER
Thelma frantically retrieves small STACKS OF CASH from hiding
places throughout the condo - couch cushions, mattresses,
balled up socks, bookshelves.
INT. THELMA’S CONDO - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER
She makes her way down the long hall, hustling with great
effort, clutching an ENVELOPE OF CASH.
A large potted plant sits by the elevator. Maintaining her
momentum, she walks directly through the overgrown leafy
branch, letting it wallop her gently as she passes, unwilling
to risk a directional change.
INT. THELMA’S CONDO - “ELEVATOR” - MOMENTS LATER
Thelma steadies her breathing as she calls GAIL, her daughter
(and Daniel’s mom). It rings. And rings.
INT. WARMLY FURNISHED OFFICE - SIMULTANEOUS
In the foreground, a cell phone lights up. It’s on silent.
In the background, GAIL MARKOWITZ (50s) attentive, nodding,
an empathetic bundle of nerves, is seated in a comfortable
chair, notepad in hand. She listens to a PATIENT who sits
across from her. Her voicemail picks up. A beep, then--
THELMA (O.S.)
Gail! Something has happened.
EXT. THELMA’S CONDO - A LITTLE LATER
Thelma calls ALAN, her son-in-law (and Daniel’s father). It
rings. And rings. A cab pulls up and she gets in.

INT. OFFICE BUILDING - CONTINUOUS
In the foreground, his phone lights up, resting on his desk
in his personal office.
In the background, through various panes of glass, we can see
ALAN MARKOWITZ (50s) cautious, practical, muttering, in the
midst of a meeting, out of earshot.
EXT. POST OFFICE - A LITTLE LATER
Thelma waits anxiously behind a line of people waiting to
send packages. Antsy, she notices a free standing mailbox
with no line across the way.
She steps up to it, opens the slot, lifts her envelope to
insert it, then pauses...
INT. WARMLY FURNISHED OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
Gail, still nodding, closes the door behind her client. She
exhales and turns over her phone. Her face drops instantly at
the many missed calls. She clicks play on Thelma’s voicemail.
GAIL
Oh my god.
INT. POST OFFICE - SIMULTANEOUS
Thelma shakes off her hesitation and DROPS THE ENVELOPE IN.
It plummets into the darkness of the slot which closes with a
sharp crack.
GAIL (PRE-LAP)
Mom, wait, wait. Slow down--
EXT. OFFICE WALKWAY / POST OFFICE - INTERCUT
Gail hustles toward her car, keys jangling wildly, with
Thelma on speakerphone, moving past the same line.
GAIL
Who did you talk to?
THELMA
Daniel! Oh, Gail he was so upset.
He was so upset!
Gail is getting swept up now too as she tumbles into her car.

Thelma washes her hands, still on the phone.
GAIL
He’s not picking up.

Thelma crumples up some paper towels and trashes them.

She said she spoke to him! To
Daniel.
GAIL (CONT’D)
And I can’t reach him.
ALAN
He’s not picking up his
phone?
GAIL (CONT’D)
No! I’m trying him again.
Alan’s not fully convinced, but as a diligent and cautious
man he’d like to get to the bottom of things. He begins to
pack his briefcase.
ALAN
I’m getting in the car. Let me know
what you hear.
INT. NONDESCRIPT LOCATION - CONTINUOUS
Daniel’s phone lights up again. This time, a hand juts into
frame and snatches it up. We follow it to reveal a groggy
Daniel, just waking up in HIS CHILDHOOD BEDROOM.
DANIEL
Hello?
INT. THELMA’S CONDO - LIVING ROOM - LATER
The family is gathered. A distraught Thelma sits next to Gail
who fans herself and her mother with an portable hand fan.
Daniel sits opposite them, his eyes trained on Thelma, while
Alan leans against a nearby cabinet. The dialogue is
overlapping. The handheld camera drifts between them--
THELMA
He was going on and on about how
you hit someone and it’s worse than
you think - she’s pregnant! And--

struck her, with my fist?
THELMA
No, it was a car accident!
DANIEL
Oh, yes, that makes more
sense.
THELMA (CONT’D)
What are you talking about?
GAIL
This was all happening inside of a
car.
DANIEL
Got it. I misunderstood--
GAIL
Why weren’t you picking up your phone?
DANIEL
I was asleep.
Gail turns off the fan. She shifts to face Daniel, concerned.
GAIL
At 10:30? I called you at 10:30--
DANIEL
I was out late with some friends.
GAIL
(sad)
Did you get drunk?
ALAN
You didn’t drive did you?
GAIL (CONT’D)
Drinking hard liquor can make you
depressed. You know Wendy Horowitz’
son got hooked on Don Julio. He’s
been in and out of rehabs, he can’t
hold a job. He’s got no sense of
agency. He is totally lost. And he
may never find himself...
Daniel and Thelma exchange a comforting glance.
GAIL (CONT’D)
Are you listening to me?
DANIEL
Yes, I understand.
Gail turns her attention back to Thelma. She softens.

Well, she was very convincing!
THELMA
She got scared, your mother. We
were all scared.
ALAN
I wasn’t quite as scared. For the
record.
Thelma musters a chuckle.
THELMA
See what happens when you get a
call, buddy.
ALAN
I wouldn’t be fooled. My mind is
sharp as a tac.
THELMA
Wha?
ALAN
(same joke, louder)
I said I wouldn’t be fooled. My
mind is sharp as a tac!
Thelma turns to Daniel.
THELMA
What’s he saying?
GAIL

You have to speak louder.
DANIEL
He’s making a joke.

You’re safe. That’s all that
matters.
THELMA
I sent the money.
Daniel, Gail, and Alan exchange a glance.
SMASH TO:
INT. DANIEL’S CAR - MOMENTS LATER
Daniel, Alan, Gail, and Thelma are crammed into Daniel’s old
Camry (which is actually Thelma’s old Camry, with colorful
sun hats displayed in the rear window). Everyone is silent.
Tense. Daniel is speeding.
ALAN
You’re speeding, Daniel.
INT. POLICE STATION - LATER
The family sits across from DETECTIVE MORGAN (50s) seasoned
and generally unhelpful.
DETECTIVE MORGAN
We can report a tracking number if
it’s with Western Union, FedEx,
UPS. With a letter, our only real
option is to notify the postal
service but with these types of
things the odds are slim.
Especially without the address...
THELMA
I think I have it here.
Thelma rifles through her purse, searching for the slip of
paper with the mailing address. Gail is incensed.

GAIL
Such a mean thing to do! Just sick!
ALAN
Is there anything that can be done?
A database of some kind?
Detective Morgan offers a meager shrug.
GAIL
We’ve lost our moral center as a
society. This is a systemic
problem.
THELMA
I don’t know where it is.
The reality that the money may be gone sets in. Daniel puts
his arm around Thelma.
DETECTIVE MORGAN
If it’s any comfort, these kinds of
scams are increasingly common.
THELMA
How would they know who I am?
GAIL
Oh my god! How would they know
that?
DETECTIVE MORGAN
They contact people at random using
telephone listings, social
networking sites--
THELMA
Like Facebook?
DETECTIVE MORGAN
Sure, like Facebook.
THELMA
So how can Zuckenborg let this
happen?
DETECTIVE MORGAN
Sorry?

She’s not. This was a tangent.
DETECTIVE MORGAN
I would suggest cancelling your
cards and freezing your accounts
until you’re sure you didn’t
provide any information that could
leave the door open to fraud.
Beyond that, there’s not much we
can do at this point.
The family looks at Detective Morgan, wishing for more help.
INT. THELMA’S CONDO - KITCHEN
VARIOUS CLOSE UPS of credit cards being cut up and disposed
of as Thelma’s array of economic tools are destroyed.
INT. THELMA’S CONDO - OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER
Thelma reclines on the couch, her head resting on Daniel’s
shoulder. She’s wiped from the day’s activity.
DANIEL
Do you need a blanket? Or water?
She shakes her head and squeezes his hand.
THELMA
I’ll just close my eyes for a
minute.
Thelma shuts her eyes and Daniel slips out.
After a beat, she begins to overhear the discussion in the
next room--
GAIL (O.S.)

Not really.

DANIEL (O.S.)
I haven’t noticed a big difference.
Little things maybe--
GAIL (O.S.)
She’s gotten these calls in the
past.
ALAN (O.S.)
This wouldn’t have happened a year
ago. She’s not as self-reliant as
she was.
GAIL (O.S.)
We may be entering a new phase.
This one stings. Off Thelma’s reaction...
INT. THELMA’S CONDO - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
A picturesque wide. In the foreground, Alan, Gail, and Daniel
sit on couches in Thelma’s meticulously maintained space.
DANIEL
What do you mean “new phase”?
GAIL
I’m questioning whether living
alone is the best option at this
point in her life?
DANIEL
You think we’re there? I mean, I
lost my wallet last week but I
don’t think that’s a reflection of
my mind deteriorating.

Good, because you shouldn’t be

What is it with you and
databases all of a sudden?
ALAN (CONT’D)
You don’t want to end up in
one.
DANIEL (CONT’D)
I’m just saying I think this can be
handled. Maybe I can handle it.
ALAN
What are you proposing?
DANIEL
...I’ll call everyday. I’ll come
over more, make sure she wears her
Lyfe Line--
GAIL
It’s a nice idea but I’m not sure
it’s realistic. You’ve got enough
on your plate and we should be free
to focus on our job search.
DANIEL
You mean... my job search?
GAIL (CONT’D)
Of course, you know what I
mean--
DANIEL (CONT’D)
Right, yeah￾ALAN
He could put it on his resume. If
that feels ethical?
In the background, Thelma re-emerges. She makes her way to
the bar and begins organizing its contents.
GAIL
I wouldn’t be able to forgive

was.
ALAN (CONT’D)
Maybe it’s time for assisted living.
GAIL
Ugh, she’d never forgive me.
In the background, Thelma notices a picture frame on the wall
is slightly askew. She disappears around the corner again.
ALAN
We could consider full time care
but it’s expensive.
GAIL
I just want what’s best for her.
DANIEL
So let me help.
GAIL
You’re not a nurse.
(to Alan)
I wonder if she’s been taking the
five blend. And the Astragalus.
DANIEL
She doesn’t need a nurse. You think
she’s gonna listen to a stranger?
She barely listens to dad.
ALAN
She just can’t hear me--
GAIL
Because you don’t project.
DANIEL
She’ll listen to me. It was one bad
day. And if it doesn’t work out,
all options are on the table. Okay?
Alan and Gail consider Daniel’s proposal...
GAIL
We could try that.
In the background, Thelma re-emerges, holding a LADDER. She

Ginger has anti-inflammatory

Sushi has mercury.

Thelma adjusts the painting. The faint scrape of the frame
makes them wheel around to see Thelma on the ladder.
GAIL (CONT’D)
OH MY GOD, MOM!
DANIEL
GRANDMA!
Daniel leaps over the couch, tripping, scrambling toward her.

Thelma looks to Daniel, who gives her a weak smile. This
stings, feeling his uncertainty. She could protest, but she’s
ashamed, as her family bears down on her.
INT. THELMA’S CONDO - ENTRYWAY - LATER
The family hugs her goodbye as Thelma puts on a show of good
temperament. Daniel lingers.
DANIEL
I’ll call you tomorrow. You sure I
can’t stay over?
THELMA
No, no. I’ve got things to do.
Daniel holds out the Lyfe Line bracelet.
DANIEL
For my mental health?
Thelma smiles, weakly. She lets him place it on her wrist.
INT. THELMA’S CONDO - KITCHEN - EVENING
Thelma cries quietly at her kitchen table. Her eyes wander to
a picture of her late husband taped to the fridge.
THELMA
I made a mistake, Teddy.
INT. THELMA’S CONDO - OFFICE - NIGHT
Thelma plays Mahjong on her computer. It’s quiet, except for
loud game SFX. With great focus, she dominates the level,
achieving a new high score. But there’s no joy in it.
INT. THELMA’S CONDO - BEDROOM - LATER
Thelma sits at the edge of her bed as the TV illuminates the
room with pulsing colorful light.
INT. THELMA’S CONDO - LIVING ROOM - MORNING
Birds chirp. Leaves rustle. Thelma sips coffee as she looks
at her condo wistfully. She is dwarfed by it, in a way. By
the artifacts she has accumulated. The room feels
significant, the kind of space it takes a lifetime to curate.

She sifts through a pile of mail and uncovers an LA Times
with a simultaneously well-worn and impossibly fit Tom Cruise
on the front page of the Calendar section. She studies it.
The headline reads: “Mission Possible! At 60, Tom Cruise
Still Isn’t Taking No for an Answer.”
We PUSH IN on Tom. And on Thelma, tapping her foot
incessantly. An idea taking shape.
INT. THELMA’S CONDO - VARIOUS - MOMENTS LATER
Thelma hunts for the missing address. She reorganizes
countertops. Checks beneath cushions. Peers under couches. No
note. But she does find another marble.
INT. THELMA’S CONDO - BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
She adds the marble to her collection. Then glances toward
the front door...
Music kicks in. A SERIES OF QUICK CUTS:
--She puts in hearing aids.
--Slips on a silk leopard print turtle neck.
--Straps on her velcro Mephisto’s.
--Places a Fiji water into her purse, followed by a Ziploc
bag of nuts. She tosses in her to-go needlepoint gear.
--She puts on a sun hat and her post-cataract surgery
sunglasses. For maximum coverage.
--She glances at her Lyfe Line. Considers putting it on. Then
drops it in her purse.
INT. THELMA’S CONDO - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER
Thelma traverses the long hallway. Near the elevator, she
gets gently walloped by the same overgrown branch.
EXT. THELMA’S CONDO - MOMENTS LATER
She pushes her way out the door, carefully down a few wide
brick steps and onto the sidewalk. She walks, slow and
steady, scanning the ground.

EXT. VALLEY SIDEWALK - A LITTLE LATER
The camera tracks sideways, as storefronts and pedestrians
pass. Then, Thelma enters frame, powering down the street.
We follow her path in a SINGLE SHOT, moving parallel with the
action. It’s our hero’s version of an uninterrupted Tom
Cruise running shot. Just slower.
She hustles, maintaining her speed and her balance, hobbling
over cracked pavement and navigating oncoming foot traffic.
We stay with her as she charges forward.
EXT. POST OFFICE - A LITTLE LATER
As Thelma, breathing heavy, arrives at the entrance, she
passes an OLDER WOMAN strolling with an OLDER MAN. They
exchange the obligatory acknowledgement of age - a respectful
nod. Thelma touches the woman’s arm familiarly.
THELMA
Hi.
OLDER WOMAN
Hello.
THELMA
Do we know each other?
OLDER WOMAN
I’m not sure.
THELMA
You look so familiar. Do you know,
Judy? Judy Miller?
OLDER WOMAN
I don’t think so. Do you know
Ellen? Ellen Marcus?

No, no, I don’t think so.

Thelma finishes washing her hands. She crumples up some paper
towels and trashes them. Then she pauses - this motion
feeling oddly familiar.
She bends over and rummages through the contents of the can.
She locates a slip of crinkled up paper amidst the paper
towels. She unfolds it to reveal: THE ADDRESS.
INT. DANIEL’S CHILDHOOD BEDROOM - SIMULTANEOUS
Daniel sits cross-legged on the bed, laptop open, scrubbing
through old Photobooth selfies of him and his ex ALLIE (24).
Browser windows populate the background which seem to suggest
a job search underway. He scoops a handful of pretzels from
the jar Thelma gave him, eating his feelings.
He’s encircled by the paraphernalia of his youth - trophies,
movie posters, shelves of required school reading never read.
His bed is a life raft in a sea of clothing piles.
A repetitive “whoop” SFX draws his eye to an unfolding text
thread: Gail is sending a million links to JOB LISTINGS she’s
found, with occasional commentary by Alan--
*Whoop*
GAIL: Hi Daniel. Just leaving my book group. We read a
fascinating novel called American Dirt. Some very lively
discussion! Found out Rebecca Watnick’s husband has a dental
practice off Sawtelle. They’re looking for front of house.
*Whoop*
ALAN: Rebecca Watnick’s husband is a lawyer.
*Whoop*
GAIL: You’re thinking of the Resnicks. Becca Resnick.
*Whoop*
ALAN: That’s correct. Who is Watnick?

THELMA

THELMA
But I found it. I have it here--
Thelma’s immediate physical well-being top of mind, Daniel
pulls back, trying a softer approach.
DANIEL
I know, but maybe it’d be better to
just... pause. For now. And we can
figure it out together.
THELMA
What about my money? Am I supposed
to just let them have it?
DANIEL
Well, the odds of getting it back
are pretty slim, right? The most
important thing is that you don’t
overdo it. That you’re safe.
Thelma is silent. Crestfallen.
DANIEL (CONT’D)
I’m sorry about the money. But it
could have been a lot worse.

Are you okay? You’re at home now?
THELMA
I’m fine. Yes, I’m home.

EXT. POST OFFICE - BENCH - MOMENTS LATER
Thelma slumps in her seat, stumped. Then something catches
her eye - a man on a MOTORIZED SCOOTER. She watches as he
putters by, traveling at breakneck speeds of 5-8mph.
Something clicks. And she makes one more call.
THELMA
Danny? I need a ride.
INT. DANIEL’S CAR - LATER
Daniel drives, Thelma sits shotgun as quiet show tunes play.
DANIEL
Just to get this out of the way up
top, you were not at home.
Thelma shrugs, playing it off. Then--
THELMA
All my friends are dead.
DANIEL
What? Don’t say that--
THELMA
It’s true. They’re all popping off.
I used to be in four lunch groups.
Who’s left? Judith? She can’t hear
anything. And she’s a hunchback
now. I wouldn’t want to have lunch
with her alone. Herman’s in Canada.
Mona doesn’t leave the house. I
could invite Lee Horner to join us
but I don’t have her number. And
Ruth burned up in a fire pit.

Sheryl was my friend. Ben and Teddy
got along well enough. I found him
a little soft.
DANIEL
Soft?
THELMA
I don’t know. Fussy.
(then)
Sheryl’s dead too. She fell down
some stairs in their house. She was
there for hours before they found
her. Poor thing.
DANIEL
I remember, yeah. So awful.
Daniel seems rattled, his worst fears proven possible. Thelma
scoops a handful of crinkled up paper off the car mat.
THELMA
The car is filthy.
DANIEL
I’m taking good care of it. I’ll
clean it.
THELMA
You won’t clean it. Who raised you?
DANIEL
Your daughter.
THELMA
Nice try. This is your father’s

Daniel reflexively adjusts his posture.
EXT. BELWOOD VILLAGE SENIOR LIVING FACILITY - LATER
A sizable building with a cream exterior and red trim. Well￾kept but sterile.
The car idles in a loading zone as Daniel pulls Thelma out of
the passenger seat, still clutching a handful of trash.
DANIEL
You want me to come in?
THELMA
I’m just saying hello. Won’t be
long. 30 minutes.
DANIEL
I’m here if you need me.
She nods, appreciative. Daniel discretely sets a timer on his
phone for 30 minutes. A countdown begins...
Thelma turns to face Belwood, an uneasiness rising in her.

Then she rounds a corner to reveal the MAIN ROOM where a show

The stage is lit theatrically as a group of seniors, led by
an impressively LIMBER MAN in his 80s, perform a jazz dance
routine. The room is peppered with residents, watching.
Sleeping. Thelma furrows her brow.
She cautiously inches her way across the space. It’s like the
scene in the action movie where the hero tracks down a
contact at a crowded club. Just less crowded.
INT. BVSLF - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
Faint jazz echoes in the hall. Thelma passes a series of
doorways, each housing a unique tableau of a senior in their
shrunken habitat. She looks practically scandalized by her
surroundings, visibly put off by the Belwood lifestyle.
At the end of the corridor, she peers into a multipurpose
space where a REHEARSAL of sorts is taking place.
INT. BVSLF - MULTIPURPOSE ROOM - CONTINUOUS
A TALL MAN addresses a WOMAN IN A RED WIG seated beside him.
TALL MAN
Then you'll go to the Roxy. And

Gloria shrugs like - “yeah, I know.” The Tall Man catches
Thelma’s eye. She plasters on a grin and waves. A flash of
recognition, as a smile spreads across the Tall Man’s face.
This is BEN (80s), tall and anxious with kind, sympathetic
eyes. He has an athletic physique, even if time has stripped
away some mass (this is the same man who left the voicemail on
Thelma’s condo answering machine).
INT. BVSLF - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER
Ben gives Thelma a hug. They separate, taking each other in.

Ben slows and turns to Thelma, serious.
BEN (CONT’D)
I think about Teddy often. Such a

Just about two.

gear including his DELUXE SENIOR MOBILITY SCOOTER. Ben
squirts hand sanitizer from the contraption on the wall and
rubs it in.
BEN
Got a TV. Plants. Window--

scooter.
BEN (CONT’D)

Ben gestures to GARY (90), a stationary senior with weird
energy. He sits upright on his bed, staring at them. Thelma
nods at him. He doesn’t nod back.
BEN (CONT’D)
We call him Starey-Gary. It’s not
an insult, just a thing that
happens. I don’t think he minds.
Ben sits on his bed as Thelma fixates on the scooter. He
notices.
BEN (CONT’D)
Isn’t she a beauty? Four wheels. 43
miles per charge. Electronic auto
braking system. Bright red so
everyone can see me comin’. And a
little basket for whatever you need
really. I like to put bread in
there. Not a whole bread. Little
pieces of it.

You put them in loose?
BEN
No, no, in bags. Ziploc.

Gary doesn’t move.
THELMA
Is he gonna listen?
BEN
I’m not sure. But he’s going to
watch.
Thelma gets an idea.
THELMA
You got a telephone?
Ben nods. Thelma pulls out her iPhone and with a few elegant
and practiced swipes SYNCS her hearing aids to the microphone
at the base. Ben hands her his. She does the same.
ALL SOUND DROPS OUT except for their voices, small and tinny,
fed into each others ears. They speak in hushed voices.
THELMA (CONT’D)
I got scammed. But I have the
address where I sent the money.
It’s a P.O. Box in Sun Valley. I’m

BEN
You’re not thinking straight.
You’re grieving. At least you have

Thelma gives Ben a tentative nod. She disconnects their
headsets and the SOUND FLOODS BACK. Gary is still staring at
them. Or through them. Who can say.
BEN (CONT’D)
Why don’t you stay for lunch?
They’ve got a wonderful cafeteria.
Beautiful melons. Fresh.

Thelma emerges around a corner and drives down the hall. She
swerves gently between resident foot traffic.

Cornered, she starts accelerating toward him. The two
scooters charge toward each other, getting closer and
closer... They’re about to collide. Ben takes his foot off
the gas and throws his hands up to shield his face.
The front of their scooters THUMP into each other. They’re
both gently jostled. Thelma continues to push forward,
forcing Ben’s scooter backward. He peeks through his fingers
to see a stalwart Thelma inching him backwards.
BEN (CONT’D)
Oh my god!
They pass the doorway to Winston’s room. He starts to laugh.
BEN (CONT’D)
Don’t laugh, Winston!
Thelma lightly banks Ben’s scooter against a wall then
manages to turn and accelerate down the hall. Ben struggles
to get his going again.
INT. BVSLF - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER
Thelma spots an exit ramp outside of two heavy double doors.
She notices a HANDICAP BUTTON on the wall. She hoists herself
off the scooter and pushes it. The doors open.
Thelma scrambles to get back on but by the time she sits down
the doors are closing again.
BEN (O.S.)
THELMA!
She turns and sees Ben headed towards her from ANOTHER
HALLWAY, perpendicular to her path. Her eyes shoot forward
just as an EMPLOYEE opens the handicap doors and walks out.
Thelma STEPS ON IT. Her scooter lurches forward. Up ahead the
doors are already beginning to shut.
As she draws near, Ben flies by behind her, missing her by
inches, and zooming gently into another open door. Thelma
passes through the closing doors, making it out by a hair.

Through the window, we see Thelma drive by. Followed, a few
moments later, by Ben. Daniel checks the timer on his phone.
One minute remains...
EXT. BVSLF - ANOTHER PATHWAY - MOMENTS LATER
Nearing the exit, Thelma checks her surroundings. No Ben in
sight.
She faces forward again to see him hustling into her path
from an alternative route. Thelma hits the brakes and comes
to a halt a few inches in front of Ben. Panting, he grabs the
handlebars to steady himself, blocking her path.

We track steadily across a series of storefronts. Thelma and
Ben enter frame on his scooter. She drives, looking pleased
with herself. He’s in the backseat, unhappy.
BEN
I need to be back by eight! It’s
opening night. I can’t miss it.
THELMA
I got it, I got it.
She steps on the gas...
EXT. PUBLIC PARK - LATER
Thelma and a noticeably agitated Ben gently maneuver around
kids, parents and loose toys.

Thelma and Ben zoom across uneven surfaces, the scooter
bouncing wildly. They fly off a low curb and land with a
thud.
INT. BVSLF - LOUNGE - LATER
A tightly-wound Daniel and outwardly concerned Alan and Gail
sit across from two Belwood Staff Members - Director of
Residential Living ROCHELLE and COLIN, the floor manager. She
outranks him but both are out of their depth.
DANIEL
I checked every room, she’s not
answering her phone. But she should
have her Lyfe Line.
ROCHELLE
Has she ever wandered off before?
GAIL
Never. Not like this.
DANIEL
I thought I lost her at
Souplantation once but she was just
going back for more little pizzas.
ROCHELLE
Souplantation?
ALAN
It was a buffet restaurant. You
could go back for more.
Rochelle and Colin nod as if this were meaningful.
DANIEL
I can’t believe it was called
Souplantation. Never really
processed that.
GAIL
It had things she can chew.

GAIL (CONT’D)

Alan.
DANIEL
It’s confusing the things she can
and can’t chew. Like, she can’t
have a salad but last week she ate
a cashew?
ROCHELLE
Hang on, so she’s never wandered
off - aside from returning to a
salad bar by choice?
The family murmurs - “yeah, basically, etc.”
ROCHELLE (CONT’D)
You know one of our residents is
missing too. Ben Halpern. Are the
two of them... involved?
GAIL
No, no, they’re old friends. But
she doesn’t even really like him.
ROCHELLE
Oh, so there’s bad blood there?
GAIL
What are you insinuating?
ROCHELLE
Nothing! Just trying to understand.
COLIN
You know he has a show tonight.
ALAN
How would we know that? Shouldn’t
someone notify his family?
ROCHELLE
He doesn’t have any family.
A slightly awkward beat.
GAIL
What can we be doing here? Can you
guys send out some kind of senior
alert?

COLIN
A silver alert? No. We’re not
authorized. The cops would have to
declare her a missing person--
GAIL
But she is a missing person! Don’t
you have someone watching the front
door?
COLIN
Residents do leave and come back.
It’s only been an hour, right?
DANIEL
Yeah, right. It hasn’t been
that long...
COLIN (CONT’D)
And curtain’s not until 8.
Rochelle shoots Colin a look.
ROCHELLE
Does Thelma have any significant
medical history we should be aware
of?
GAIL
She’s had breast cancer, a double
mastectomy, colon cancer, sepsis,
edema, valve replacement, hip
replacement, arrhythmia, brain
tumor--
ALAN
I think she actually has a brain
tumor now.
GAIL
Oh, right--
ALAN (CONT’D)
Yeah, the doctors said it was
growing so slowly we could
just leave it.
GAIL (CONT’D)
So all of that as well as a brain
tumor at the moment.
Rochelle and Colin cover their alarm, processing.
ROCHELLE
Wow. Okay. Well... thank you for
that information.

GAIL
Yes, yes--
COLIN
TGA?
ALAN
Transient global amnesia.
GAIL
It was a few years ago. She got
very disoriented. She didn’t know
who she was, who we were. It passed
after about an hour but it was...
unsettling.
They jot this down. Daniel feels compelled to chime in.
DANIEL
But she’s a tough cookie. Obviously
we want help tracking her down. But
there’s still a chance it’s a
“going back to the buffet” type
situation.
ROCHELLE
The good news is they rarely go
far.
EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - CONTINUOUS
Ben and Thelma drive down a tree lined street. He diligently
observes their surroundings, adjusting to the great outdoors.
BEN
Why does this street look so
familiar?
THELMA
We’re stopping by Mona’s.
He perks up a little.
BEN
Mona. God, I haven’t seen her since

BEN
‘98, I think. The flight was bumpy.
Otherwise it was terrific. You know

acted on it but she would stare at
my legs when I was in short pants.
THELMA
Whatever you say, buddy. If you’re
right, maybe we can use it.
Then--
BEN
...Why are we going to Mona’s?
THELMA
To get a gun.
BEN
OH MY GOD! Why do we need a gun?
THELMA
It’s just a precaution! A couple of
shmegeggies like us turning up
unannounced? I like to be prepared.
BEN
Would you even know how to use it?
THELMA
How hard could it be? Idiots use
them all the time.
BEN
I don’t think we should have a gun.
THELMA
So what if we get there and he has
a gun? Then what?
Ben had not considered this.
BEN
If he has a gun... then I’d like us
to have a gun too.
Thelma nods - “there ya go.”

BEN
Maybe I can do my monologue.
THELMA
I’d rather you didn’t.
EXT. MONA’S HOUSE - LATER
Thelma and Ben pull up to a modest Craftsman two story home.
The facade appears in good condition aside from a mildly
disheveled garden.
They approach to find the front door slightly ajar. They look
to each other, then push it open...
INT. MONA’S HOUSE - ENTRYWAY - CONTINUOUS
The inside is a grimmer scene. Wilting plants crowd surfaces.
The sound of a TV on high volume fills the space.
Thelma and Ben head toward the sound, passing a dark, looming
STAIRCASE off the hall. Ben clocks it. As does Thelma.
INT. MONA’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
They round a corner to find MONA (92) delicate and pale,
seated in a chair in front of her television. Table tops are
cluttered with unwashed mugs and dirty plates. Beams of light
stream in from half open shades, catching flicks of dust in
the air. Thelma and Ben enter Mona’s field of view...
THELMA
Mona?
An uneasy beat, then a glint of recognition. Her voice is
light and trembling.
MONA
Thel, darling. Did we make a date?
Thelma and Ben are clearly thrown by the state of her home.

BEN
Good to see you, doll.
Mona smiles back. Thelma leans down--
THELMA
Are you alright?
MONA
Fine, fine.
Mona fiddles with the remote and mutes the television. Ben
carefully lowers himself onto the couch with a light thud.
Thelma stacks empty dishes on a nearby countertop.
MONA (CONT’D)
Sit, dear. Don’t clean--
THELMA
Okay, okay.
But she continues. She lifts a plate to find a COCKROACH
scurrying past and lets out a small yelp. She picks up a
nearby napkin and crushes it.
MONA
Is it a roach?
Thelma crinkles the paper shut in her palm.
THELMA
I got him.

Ben nods politely, squirming in his seat.
BEN
How are you? How’s your health?
MONA
I’m alive.
BEN
Isn’t that somethin’.
Mona reaches out a hand, Ben takes it lovingly.
THELMA
I’ve gotta use the restroom.
MONA
Good, dear.
Thelma shoots Ben a look and she’s off.
BEN
We were just talking about Berlin.
INT. MONA’S HOUSE - STAIRCASE - MOMENTS LATER
Thelma emerges at the base of the stairs, eyeing the climb
ahead. She hoists herself from step to step, clutching the
banister with both hands.
As she nears the top, she slips on the STAIR RUNNER and
topples forward but catches herself on the banister, heart
racing.

Mona’s eyes light up again, re-engaged.
BEN (CONT’D)
They have the most wonderful
melons.
INT. MONA’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
Thelma cracks the door open. The room appears untouched - as
if someone was going about their routine and suddenly
stopped. The bed is half-made, clothes strewn about, photos
knocked over on a tabletop.
She picks one up: Thelma, Mona, Ben, with their spouses
celebrating New Years eve at Mona’s house. A snapshot of the
“good ‘ol days.” A melancholy smile creeps across Thelma’s
face. She dusts the frame off and places it upright.
INT. MONA’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - SIMULTANEOUS
Back to Ben and Mona--
BEN
Cantaloupes. Honeydews.
Honeyglobes. Jade Dews. Crenshaw

INT. MONA’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - SIMULTANEOUS
Thelma eyes the shelf above Mona’s bed. She approaches the
mattress - it’s high. Not unlike hers.
She takes a few steps back. Then hustles toward it and LEAPS
onto it, flopping onto her back. She manages to turn herself
over and get situated.
Thelma rises into frame and grips the shelf housing a LOCKED
SAFE. She places the lock between her fingers but it breaks
off before she enters a code. She opens it to find Mona’s 44
MAGNUM. Thelma delicately lifts the gun, it’s heavy.
THELMA
Oy god...
She slowly manages to sit back down and roll to the edge of
the bed. She rights herself and slides off, placing herself
on her feet. A sigh of relief.
Then, another cockroach scrambles across the floor. Startled,
Thelma loses her grip on the weapon. It hits the ground and
GOES OFF with a LOUD BANG!
INT. MONA’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - SIMULTANEOUS
In a wide, the bang ECHOES through the house and a VASE in
the background SHATTERS, the stray bullet tearing it apart
from above. Nobody seems to have heard it.
BEN
Elderberry... Goji...
But Ben is running out of berries.
INT. MONA’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - SIMULTANEOUS
Thelma cringes, frozen in place. She picks the gun up like a
dirty sock and drops it daintily into her purse, the barrel
still jutting out.

MONA

Thelma’s eyes sadden. Ben knowingly meets her gaze.
THELMA
Well, we should be on our way.
MONA
You’re leaving?
THELMA
I know, I know. We’ll have to get a
lunch on the books.
MONA
I’d like that.
THELMA
Can we get you anything?
MONA
I’ve got everything I need.
Ben struggles to his feet from the sunken couch. Thelma
watches as he kneels down and cups Mona’s face in his hands.
BEN
Goodbye, doll.
Mona stares back, present again, if only for a moment.
EXT. CITY STREET - MOMENTS LATER
The mood is slightly more somber as Thelma and Ben cruise
down the street in silence. Thelma looks ahead, pensive.
Ben’s eyes wander to her purse - the massive gun barrel
peeking out. The scooter seems to be slowing.
BEN
Needs a charge.

Daniel and Alan anxiously eat sandwiches in the waiting area
while Gail picks at her packed lunch - two boiled eggs,
arugula with a slice of lemon, carrots and dip. Daniel is
outpacing his parents, lost in thought.
GAIL
You go so fast sweetheart, you

DANIEL

Everybody. Doctors. Professionals.

Rochelle and Colin saunter over.
ROCHELLE

The family rifles through their pockets and purses. Daniel

DANIEL
No, no I have it. But I’m not

DANIEL
There’s no timeline.
GAIL

Gail nods and offers a half-hearted smile.
EXT. GAS STATION - ACROSS TOWN
Thelma and Ben sit in the stationary scooter as it charges.
Ben finishes his wet ones regiment as Thelma licks her finger

I’m sorry! I’m upset!
GAIL
We’re all upset! This is exactly

Daniel is spiraling, panic and self-loathing bubbling up.
DANIEL

their scooter, passing lit up storefronts.

Riding the adrenaline high, Ben can’t help but laugh. Thelma
can’t help but join in.
BEN
We’re crazy!
NEARBY, Daniel, Gail, and Alan drive in silence. Daniel sits
in the back again, framed between them, like a kid.
In a single shot, on a busy street, they pass each other,
unknowingly, as darkness sets in.
EXT. SOMEWHERE IN THE DEEP VALLEY - NIGHT
Thelma and Ben cruise through an abandoned part of town. A
lone streetlight flickers giving us glimpses of the
unfamiliar surroundings.
From Thelma’s perspective, all we can make out are points of
light, which stretch and spread, obscuring her vision. They
slow to a halt.
BEN
Think we’re getting closer?
...Thelma?
THELMA
Hang on.
BEN
What is it?
THELMA
I-- I don’t know where we are.
BEN
Don’t say that.
THELMA
I don’t recognize this area. It’s
totally different--
Ben shakes his head, his newfound ease quickly dissipating.
BEN
I knew this would happen. I follow
your lead and look what happens!
THELMA
Okay, Ben thank you--
BEN

The scooter starts to slowly creep backwards...
BEN
Excuse me!
THELMA (CONT’D)

Ben whirls around--
BEN (CONT’D)

Ben SNAPS--
BEN

A heavy silence as Ben is overcome with emotion. This stops
Thelma in her tracks, newly privy to his feelings of guilt
surrounding Sheryl’s death.
BEN (CONT’D)
We’re the only ones left, Thel.
She considers this, feeling the weight of it.
BEN (CONT’D)

They turn to where she gestured - the scooter is GONE.

He doesn’t respond, continuing down the street, leaving
Thelma alone, under the flickering streetlight.
She looks around, uneasy. Then, her face hardens.

Thelma begins to move, making her way down the street. Ben
continues in the opposite direction.

her water, then exhales, trying to steady her nerves.
Daniel stares across the seating area at an empty chair...
missing his usual companion. Gail notices.

DANIEL
This is different than Gelson’s--
ALAN
I’m aware it’s different but the
point is she’s a grown woman who’s
a little faster than you’d hope and
you can’t be responsible for her
every second of every day. We

was too much.
DANIEL
...I know she’s not going to live
forever. When it happens I just
want it to be... not horrific, you

There is no good death.
A quiet moment. Then, Daniel stands. Without missing a beat,
Alan and Gail are jostled into a state of alertness.
DANIEL
I’m gonna take a walk.

Daniel turns to go, his parents looming large behind him.
EXT. ANOTHER DESERTED AREA IN THE DEEP VALLEY
Slightly disoriented and eyeing a beacon of light in the
distance (that looks like a post office), Thelma begins to
traverse an area of uneven dirt. She extends her feet onto
the soil carefully at first, getting her balance. Then she
begins to move.
INT. BVSLF - HALLWAY - SIMULTANEOUS
Daniel wanders down the corridor. He passes the same series
of doorways that Thelma passed - each housing a unique
tableau of a senior in their shrunken habitat. Now, at night.
Each of them is still. A state Thelma rarely inhabits.
Daniel’s brow furrows, imagining her here.
At the end of the hall, he encounters a cork board. Among
charts that outline meal plans, quiet hours, and house rules,
Daniel notices a small colorful poster - “Math for Seniors:
You’re Never Too Old To Reacquaint Yourself with Numbers!”
EXT. ANOTHER DESERTED AREA IN THE DEEP VALLEY - SIMULTANEOUS
Thelma’s making progress, starting to get the hang of it...
When she loses her balance. And FALLS. Hard. She hits the
dirt face first, crying out in pain.

She lays there for a beat. Motionless.
She manages to roll over onto her back and immediately
clutches her eye, which is beginning to swell.
She attempts to lift herself, letting out a holler of
exertion, but can’t muster the strength. She flops back onto
the dirt.
After a quiet beat, the sound of people chatting comes into
earshot. Thelma glances toward the sidewalk where a YOUNG
COUPLE strolls by. She nearly calls out but hesitates,
ashamed of her circumstance. She stays silent as they pass -
flat on her back and shrouded in darkness.
She strains to lift herself. Then flops back down. Nothing.
EXT. NEARBY STREET IN THE DEEP VALLEY - SIMULTANEOUS
Ben cautiously makes his way down a darkened street. A burst
of tinny sound causes him to cock his head, confused. Another
burst of garbled chatter brings him to halt. He searches for
the source. But there’s no one there.
GARBLED VOICE (O.S.)
So stupid-- stupid! Okay, alright--
He touches his ear and realizes it’s coming from his HEARING
AID. It’s Thelma struggling to get up - her phone still
synced to his earpiece.
BEN
Thelma?
EXT. DESERTED AREA IN THE DEEP VALLEY - CONTINUOUS
Her strength waning, Thelma lays uncharacteristically still.
THELMA
(acceptance)
Okay. Okay.
She checks her wrist and is reminded that she shed her Lyfe
Line. Stuck, her eyes well up with tears, feeling foolish.
She pulls out her hearing aids and ALL GOES QUIET. All we can
hear are her labored inhales and exhales as she stares up,
the light of the stars mimicking the streetlights, spreading
and stretching across the night sky.

INT. BVSLF - MULTIPURPOSE ROOM - SIMULTANEOUS
Daniel lays on his back, trying to calm his nerves. He stares
at the ceiling. But it feels like he’s looking at Thelma. And
she’s looking at him. Inextricably linked in their quests for
independence. He takes a deep breath and exhales.
EXT. DESERTED AREA IN THE DEEP VALLEY - CONTINUOUS
A patch of dust drifts by Thelma’s face, as if kicked up. She
turns to see Ben standing beside her. Looking almost heroic.
Instead of extending a hand, he kneels next to her, and
begins to help her up.
Ben methodically slides her legs into a bent-knee position.
He folds her arms across her midsection, then gently rolls
her onto her side.
From there, Thelma is able to get onto her hands and knees.
Ben interlocks arms with her, pulling them tight. Slowly,
using each other as counterbalance, they rise to their feet.
EXT. DEEP VALLEY - PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS
On solid ground, they plop onto a bus bench. A long beat, as
they catch their breath.
THELMA
Thank you.
BEN
You’re welcome.
Another beat.
THELMA
I am sorry. About all of it. We
gave it a good try didn’t we?
Ben nods.
THELMA (CONT’D)
(reflective)
I lived with my parents until I was
23. Then I moved in with Teddy. And
I lived with him until I was 91.
I’ve lived, just me, for two years

Teddy. But I tried sushi. And I
liked that quite a bit. I’ve
enjoyed my time alone. I guess I

Ben’s gaze stays fixed on her, a comfortable listener, as she
finally opens up. They sit in silence, until...
A CAR pulls up to the light in front of them. Thelma spots
the driver and squints...
THELMA (CONT’D)
I think I know her.
Thelma struggles to her feet and heads toward the car.
THELMA (CONT’D)
Lois?
The WOMAN inside turns. She rolls down the window.
LOIS
Thelma!
Thelma beckons Ben toward the car.
INT. LOIS’ CAR - MOMENTS LATER
Thelma and Ben are in the backseat. LOIS rides shotgun and
her partner MARY (70s) drives. They’re dressed nicely.
LOIS
We just saw Swan Lake. It was set
during the Korean war? So the
dancers were dressed as soldiers--
I don’t know that I understood it
but it was beautifully staged. I
think it was very political.
THELMA
Sounds interesting.
LOIS
It was, yes. Where can we take you?
THELMA
...Just home. Ben, what’s your
address?
BEN
We’re headed to 21821 San Fernando

EXT. 21821 SAN FERNANDO ROAD - LATER
A seedy post office. The car pulls into frame. It clips the
curb, rises up onto it then drops back off, as it comes to a
halt. The doors fly open and Thelma and Ben slowly emerge,
cautiously lowering themselves to the street.
Lois watches Thelma go - in awe.
LOIS
God, she’s unbelievable. Same
house, no help. She doesn’t drive,
you know, but that’s about it.

It’s been a couple of hours so far.
It’s sort of unclear... the whole

watch her, so...

DANIEL
Yeah. I hope so.
Beat. Then, following a feeling--
DANIEL (CONT’D)
Hey, I’ve also been wanting to call
you. I’ve been thinking about
taking some classes. Learning some
new skills. Maybe even like an
adult math class, figured I could
brush up on some of the essentials.

Self-improvement. I’m just saying I

Adding. Subtracting. Fractals...

I can take the... great leap-- from
boy to man!
Allie reluctantly chuckles at this.
ALLIE

whole time.
EXT. SEEDY POST OFFICE - LATER
Thelma and Ben pass the time on a bench out front. She
needlepoints as he stares off into the distance,
contemplative.
THELMA
...We used to call bread the staff
of life. Now nobody wants to eat
bread. But there are delicious
breads that are made now. It’s a
conundrum.
Ben joins in her musings.

toppings.
THELMA
It’s interesting. The way we think

Ben pulls a piece of bread in a ziploc out of his jacket
pocket. They tear it in half and share it. A nice moment.

Just then, a YOUNG MAN, tall and stoney, enters the building.
He heads straight for the P.O. Box and unlocks it. He pulls
out various catalogues and promotional mailings then trashes
them. Thelma inhales sharply. She nudges Ben. They watch,
frozen, as he locks up and leaves.
THELMA (CONT’D)
Come on, we’re gonna lose him.

Thelma and Ben follow the Young Man as he crosses the street

exchange a glance, confused.

Thelma and Ben arrive at the entrance and gaze at the lit up
storefront. A eerie glow in the darkness.

you go for help.
BEN
How will I know?

You’ll be with me.
Thelma gives Ben her cell phone, which is linked up to her
hearing aids. Ben nods and does the same.
INT. ANTIQUE STORE - CONTINUOUS
Thelma steps into the entryway, engulfed by lamps of all
shapes and sizes. From her perspective, the array of light
sources create a disorienting effect.
THELMA

out her path through the clutter.
She glances to her right where Ben is stationed outside,
holding her phone.
Thelma exhales, steeling herself, and starts through the sea
of oddities -- cracked vases, rusting furniture, dusty clown
figurines. Ben moves parallel, overseeing her passage.
BEN (O.S.) (CONT’D)
Two steps to your left. Straight
for five paces.
She follows his guidance, narrowly avoiding the obstacles.
BEN (O.S.) (CONT’D)
There’s a stack of loose hummels,
or maybe they’re gnomes? Some kind
of little animals? On your left.
Keep your distance.
It’s like the scene in the action movie where the hero avoids
detection by lasers. If the lasers were delicate antiques.
BEN (O.S.) (CONT’D)
Gets a little hairy up ahead. Take

Thelma turns and SQUEEZES through a narrow passage of
fixtures, the bulbs gently bumping into her as she moves.
She’s made her way through most of them when she knocks over
a small lamp, which shatters.

Thelma stands. The backdoor is just ahead but the path looks
impossible to navigate, obscured by boxes and a large COUCH.
Knowing this move well, she plops herself down on the couch
and impressively rotates her body across its cushions.
Gripping some surrounding shelves, she laboriously pulls
herself up and lands safely on the one yard line.
Thelma dusts herself off then triumphantly opens the door.
Stepping into...
INT. ANTIQUE STORE - BACK ROOM - CONTINUOUS
A decrepit storage space. Cardboard boxes, fast food
remnants, a desk with a sizable COMPUTER MONITOR where the
Young Man (MICHAEL) is seated. His eyes bloodshot, a corded
telephone pressed to his ear.
Beside him, facing away, a hunched FIGURE leans on the desk,
speaking into a separate receiver. He’s gesticulating like
he’s talking but Thelma can’t hear him. She pulls out one
hearing aid and sound floods in. It’s a familiar voice...
comforting but firm.
FIGURE
Yes, sir... well, hesitating here
is what will cost you. There’s a
fair amount of unpleasantness
ahead. We don’t want him in holding
any longer than he needs to be...
He desperately beckons for a lit cigarette that Michael is
fearfully holding. Michael creeps forward, extending the
cigarette like a morsel for a hungry lion.
FIGURE (CONT’D)
I’m sure Kevin is a very good boy
but even good boys make mistakes.
He takes a drag and then almost instantly shoos it away as if
it were radioactive. Michael puts it in an ashtray full of
other barely smoked cigarettes.
Thelma takes a step forward, letting the door close with an
unexpected SLAM. The Young Man turns sharply. The Figure
swivels around and meets Thelma’s eye. Caught off guard, he
slams the phone down.
This is HARVEY (70s) wild-eyed, stubbly, and agitated,
wearing a loose tank top beneath an unbuttoned linen shirt, a
Nasal Cannula in his nose.

They all stare at each other, unsure what comes next.

You might recognize me. From the
telephone.
Michael surreptitiously slips a piece of paper off the desk,
into a drawer. Harvey squints, trying to recall.
HARVEY
Can’t say that I do, ma’am. And I’d
like to think I would. We’re closed
but you can come back tomorrow. We
just got a box of those terrific
little-- what do you call them--
it’s a woman inside a woman inside

Harvey takes a step toward her, his tank in tow. It makes a
terrible scraping sound as he drags it across the floor. His
smile has faded.
HARVEY
You made a mistake. That’s okay. I
make mistakes too.

Let’s not make another.
Is this a threat? Thelma pulls out her phone.

not personal. You gotta understand

we used to. People these days, they

Everybody buys their fucking shit
on Amazon! So I take what I need to
survive. Why do you need it so bad?
THELMA
Because it’s mine. And I decide who
gets it.
Harvey’s expression hardens. Thelma tries to retract her arm,
but his grip is firm. Harvey nods to Michael who moves toward
them from the opposite corner.
Thelma tries to break free again, yanking hard, but Harvey’s
grasp is like a vice. He has her now. With great effort, he
rises to his feet, snarling.
HARVEY
You’re being unreasonable.
Genuinely overwhelmed and suddenly surrounded, Thelma
swallows hard as the COLOR DRAINS FROM HER FACE.
HARVEY (CONT’D)
Michael, get my keys.
She blinks. Then blinks again. Disoriented.
THELMA
I... um...
Her footing unsteady, she looks around, as if seeing the room
for the first time.
THELMA (CONT’D)
How did I... I’m sorry, I don’t
recognize this. I’m a bit confused.
A beat, as Harvey and Michael share a look. Harvey gently
releases his grip and Thelma begins to wander.
THELMA (CONT’D)
I need to call my husband.
HARVEY
Of course.
She turns to him, blankly.
THELMA
What is your name, dear?
HARVEY
I’m Harvey.

EXT. ANTIQUE STORE - SIMULTANEOUS
Ben paces, worked up. He tries the phone one more time--
BEN
Talk to me, Thel! What’s going on?
INT. ANTIQUE STORE - BACK ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Thelma leans on the desk to support herself. Harvey, calmer
now, helps her down into a chair. Michael watches intently.
THELMA
I’m terribly sorry for the
imposition...
She’s breathing heavy now.
HARVEY
Pshh, please! It’s alright. Happens
to the best of us. The mind is a
funny thing, you know? Where do you
live, hun? We’ll get you home.
Harvey turns his back, bending over to pick up her phone. But
suddenly, his expression changes. The camera slowly moves
across his body to find a GUN pressed against his lower back.
Thelma holds the weapon, and the upper hand.
THELMA
My money. Harvey.
Harvey freezes. Then, Michael BOLTS. Thelma doesn’t move.
HARVEY
Michael, you coward!
EXT. ANTIQUE STORE - CONTINUOUS
Michael barrels toward the exit, shattering bulbs and vases
in his path. Sparks flying. He’s getting all cut up.
Just then, Ben emerges in the doorway. Michael doesn’t stop,
careening toward the exit. But Ben plants his feet and
clutches the doorframe, extending his leg, bracing himself.
With a faintly metallic CLUNK, Michael trips over Ben’s
titanium hip. His momentum causes him to go soaring into the
air, feet over head, before landing with a painful thud,
knocking himself unconscious on the concrete.

INT. ANTIQUE STORE - BACK ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Thelma’s got her gun trained on Harvey as he slowly sits in
the chair behind the desk, seething and muttering.
THELMA
You were very convincing, Harvey.
You could have been an actor. Not a
star, but even so. What a waste!
HARVEY
You know how to use that thing--
THELMA
No.
Thelma FIRES haphazardly at a nearby bookshelf. Harvey jumps.
HARVEY
Jesus! Fuck! Okay-- okay.
THELMA
Where is it?
HARVEY
...It’s here.
THELMA
Where?
He gestures to the computer.
HARVEY
It’s been deposited into my
account. On the computer.
THELMA
Well, get it out.
HARVEY
I can’t.
THELMA
What do you mean you can’t?
HARVEY
Michael did the computers!
THELMA
This is ridiculous. Get up. Move--
Harvey stands. Thelma gestures to another chair nearby. He
sits. Thelma struggles to keep the gun aimed at him as she
places herself in front of the computer.

He stares at her, quiet, observing her discomfort.
HARVEY

BEN (O.S.)

Ben emerges in the doorway, standing tall. Thelma looks
thrilled to see him. Ben takes in his surroundings.
HARVEY
Who’s this?
THELMA
My friend.
Ben gleams and gives her a nod, approaching--
THELMA (CONT’D)
Take this would ya? I need both
hands.
HARVEY
What happened to Michael?
BEN
I beat him up.
She hands Ben the gun who haltingly aims it toward Harvey.
Thelma takes a crack at the computer.
THELMA
Okay. Where’s the mouse. There’s
the mouse. Come on, move.
She awkwardly tries to direct the mouse toward the dock,
clanking it around, inching it toward the dock.
Tension builds as we track with it, jutting across the
screen. She’s nearly there when her hand slips and she opens
the DOWNLOADS folder, clicking a random file that fills the
screen.
It’s a PICTURE OF A SHOE.
THELMA (CONT’D)
What is this? A shoe?
BEN
Looks like a shoe.

THELMA (CONT’D)
So what do I do? I’m gonna “x” it.
HARVEY
Wait, don’t--
THELMA (CONT’D)
You don’t know what it is.
She manages to click on the RED X in the corner. It
disappears. She continues toward the INTERNET EXPLORER ICON,
clicks it, and it opens to Google.
Before she can plug anything in, a pop-up banner opens and
expands, taking over the screen. It’s some kind of GENERIC
INSURANCE AD. Images of babies and families fill the screen.
THELMA (CONT’D)
That’s a... baby.
She tries to x it out but clicks on the banner and opens the
insurance website. She’s overwhelmed. And stuck.
THELMA (CONT’D)

INT. BACK ROOM - INTERCUT
The camera begins to move, slowly swirling around Thelma
seated at the monitor. It’s like the sequence in the action
movie where they hack into the mainframe... except it’s a
Dell in the back room of an antique store.
THELMA
It’s a family and a baby and
they’re everywhere.
DANIEL
Are there words?
THELMA
It says... Prudential--
DANIEL
It’s an ad. You need to find the x.
THELMA
There’s no red x.
DANIEL
It’s not always red. Sometimes they
hide it. Look closer.
Thelma leans in, searching for it. Ben searches too.
BEN

Top right.
She clicks the x and it disappears.
THELMA
I x’d it!
EXT. CITY STREETS - INTERCUT
Daniel floors it, blowing through a stop sign. His family
thread is blowing up with a constant flow of incoming texts
from Alan and Gail - “Where are you?” Daniel, please call
us.” “This isn’t funny!” He ignores them and presses on.
DANIEL
Good! So think of it like a

Thelma runs her fingers over the keys, finds it, and clicks.

text from Gail comes through - “WE’RE CALLING THE COPS!”
--We catch close-ups of Thelma’s eyes darting back and forth.
The cursor moving swiftly across the screen.

Thelma shuffles through papers and finds a sheet with all of
the passwords consolidated. She scans with her finger...
THELMA
Oh my god--
DANIEL (O.S.)
What?
THELMA
The password... is “password.”
Harvey scoffs and rolls his eyes.

Classic. Now click inside of that
box and type it in.
She begins to enter it.

That’s cute.
Harvey grits his teeth as he lights up a cigarette.

back. Blood drips from his head wound.
--Daniel’s speedometer inches higher and higher as the Camry
rumbles with acceleration.

trained on Harvey. Thelma’s in the zone now. Handling the

She thinks on it. Sincerely. For a moment.
THELMA (CONT’D)

DANIEL
Good. Remember what we do?
THELMA
The x. No matter what color.
DANIEL
That’s right.
She finds the “x” and closes it. The transfer page fills the
screen, boxes waiting to be filled.
THELMA
I’m in. Be ready in five.
Thelma hangs up. She types in: $10,000. She glances over at
Harvey, pathetic as ever. She re-enters, $9,500.
She pulls a neatly folded list from her wallet, containing
her passwords and account numbers. She finds her checking
account and types in the routing number. Methodically.
She coaxes the mouse over to the “transfer” button but before
she can click it--
Michael comes SPRINTING into the room, headed straight for
them. Without hesitation Ben wheels around, turning the gun
on Michael, who stops dead in his tracks.
Harvey starts to scramble up but Thelma instinctively grabs
hold of his OXYGEN TUBE and PINCHES IT, cutting off his
supplemental supply. He stares at her, shocked, as his
breathing becomes labored. Thelma turns to Michael.

A tense pause as Michael stands there, quivering, blood still
dripping from his forehead. Then--
THELMA (CONT’D)
He called you a dumbass. He said it
quietly but I heard it.
Michael stares Harvey dead in the eyes. Harvey stares back,
nearly incapacitated, unable to speak.
Then, Michael turns, slowly, calmly, and walks out.
Ben turns the gun on Harvey once more as Thelma RELEASES HER
GRIP on his tube and oxygen floods his lungs.
HARVEY
(gasping)
YOU’RE INSANE!
Thelma re-orients the mouse over the transfer button.
She clicks it.
The page loads. She waits...
A message pops up - “Your Transfer Has Been Initiated.” She
sits back and exhales, relief washing over her.
BEN
That’s it?
THELMA
I think that’s it.
BEN
He can’t get it back?
Thelma gets up, takes the gun from Ben and EMPTIES it at the
computer, shattering the screen, DESTROYING IT.
THELMA
He can’t get it back.

his mouth. Thelma approaches.

EXT. ANTIQUE STORE - MOMENTS LATER
Thelma tosses the cigarette into a trash can. It lands next
to a discarded OXYGEN TANK. Thelma and Ben make their way

After a beat, all of their phones BLARE in unison with a
distinctive tone. They all pull them out to find the same
notification - a SILVER ALERT.
It reads: EMERGENCY ALERT. Silver Alert, Missing/Endangered
Elderly. Female, Thelma Post. Male, Benjamin Halpern. Likely
on foot. Or scooter.
BEN (CONT’D)
We’re famous.
Daniel puts pedal to the metal and they peel out. An action

Anxiety turns to overwhelming relief as she holds her mom.

EXT. CITY STREET - AFTERNOON
Daniel drives and Thelma gazes out the window as they zoom
along beside a center divider chock full of old coral trees.
THELMA
Look! Look at all those bottoms of
those trees. Look at how gnarled
they are, and yet they live. Look!

Thelma crosses the living room with a walker. Her coffee
supported by the attached tray. She gently pushes the walker,
which rolls a few paces ahead, then catches up to it. A
little game to stay sharp.
INT. THELMA’S CONDO - DEN - LATER
Thelma sips her coffee as she needlepoints. The news blares
in the background.
She notices something out of the corner of her eye - a
COCKROACH creeping its way into the room. Thelma watches
intently as her strange companion moves slightly, in small
bursts, toward the center of the carpet.
We CUT IN to an EXTREME CLOSE-UP of the roach, it’s tiny
antennae rotate, sussing out the unfamiliar terrain. It feels
like an omen of things to come? Of the inevitable decline?
The looming decay? Almost as if--
Suddenly, the newspaper prominently featuring Tom Cruise
flies into frame and CRUSHES IT.
We CUT WIDE to reveal Thelma, bent over, supporting herself
on the coffee table.
She tosses the roach in the trash can beside the couch. Then
sits down and gets back to work.
CUT TO BLACK.
