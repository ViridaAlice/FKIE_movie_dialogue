      The sacred fig tree, which is considered sacred in ancient 
Iranian culture, has an unusual cycle of life. The seeds of this 
tree fall on other trees, hidden in droppings of birds that feed 
on its fruit. These seeds then sprout on the branches of those
trees. The sprouts send their roots down towards the ground and 
gradually, the branches cover the trunk of the host and 
suffocate it. Thereafter, the sacred fig tree stands on its own 
feet.

A hand places eight bullets of a handgun on the table, one by 
one.
(O.S.) MAN
Take one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight...
Iman's hands enter the frame and take the bullets. Then the
man's hand places a form on the table: a receipt for the gun. He 
underlines a number and leaves the pen on the paper.

barrier walls. At an intersection, he stops at a red light. 
Looking around proudly, he glances at the gun on the chair next 
to him. 
He passes through the highway (Sadr highway, with bridge 
foundations), the side road (Fasham mountain that can be seen on

Thanks.
Seeing Iman's messy eyebrows, Najmeh fixes them with her thumb.
NAJMEH
Congratulations. Your prayers have been answered…
Iman nods in gratitude. He picks up the teacup from the tray and 
sits on the edge of the bed.
NAJMEH
May God rest his soul; I wish your father was here with us to 
see this.
Iman drinks his tea. He says under his breath "May God rest his 
soul".
NAJMEH
I am very happy, for the girls. Finally, our financial situation 
will improve. Hopefully, they will give us a three-bedroom

      house. They are all grown up now, it's difficult for them to 
share a room.
IMAN
It will take several months.
NAJMEH
It doesn’t matter.
Iman takes the gun out of the drawer and shows it to Najmeh. 
Najmeh is taken aback and looks at it with fear.
IMAN
Don't be afraid, they gave it to me for personal protection.
Najmeh contemplates for a moment.
IMAN
try it...
NAJMEH
No, I don't like to, it's dangerous.
IMAN
Take it.
Najmeh holds the gun for a moment. Iman laughs. It's as if he's 
enjoying himself unconsciously. Najmeh returns the gun. Iman 
puts it back in the drawer.
NAJMEH
I think it's time to talk about your job with the girls.
IMAN
Not yet...
NAMJMEH
Why? It's a very good opportunity. You're a judge now! If the 
kids know, they will be proud of you.
IMAN

      Not a judge, an investigating judge.
NAJMEH
Whatever. Soon you'll become an advisory judge and then a chief 
judge, right? Won't you?
Iman nods in approval.
NAJMEH
Well, then the girls need to know these things. It affects their 
behavior. They're young, they must be more considerate because 
of your job.
IMAN
You know the situation is different for revolutionary courts, 
people don't have a positive perception.
NAJMEH
Yes, but we cannot hide it from the kids forever. You always 
waited for an opportunity to talk to them about your job. Now is 
your chance.
Iman takes a moment to think it over.
NAJMEH
Tonight, four of us will go to a restaurant. We'll have a little 
celebration for your promotion, and then we'll have a 
conversation as well and share some things with the kids.
IMAN
How much can we share?
NAJMEH
Leave it to me.
Iman seems to be content with this plan and continues drinking
his tea.

By the kitchen's island, Sana is putting the plates and 
breakfast items on the table, one by one. Rezvan is preparing 
fried eggs, and Najmeh is pouring tea for everyone. From time to 
time, the clanking of dishes while being placed on the table,
can be heard in the background.
NAJMEH
Sana, keep it down dear, your dad is sleeping.
Sana does not answer.
REZVAN
But what would happen if I'm not there?
NAJMEH
What do you mean by not being there? I said it's an important 
conversation, four of us should be there!
Najmeh takes the tray and goes toward the table. Then she starts 
putting the cups next to the plates.
REZVAN
Well, tell me now.
NAJMEH
You don't seem to understand what I'm saying. Your dad should be 
there, it is both a celebration and some sort of family meeting.
REZVAN
Celebration for what?
Najmeh sits behind the table.
NAJMEH
You'll find out tonight.
Putting the pan with fried eggs on the table, Rezvan takes a 
seat.

      REZVAN
Mom, please don't ruin my night, Sadaf is coming back from her 
town. In fact, she is coming earlier because of tonight's plan. 
I asked her to come earlier, how does it look like if I don’t 
show up myself?
NAJMEH
My darling, this is an exceptional night, you and your friends 
can go to the cafe another day.
REZVAN
What do you mean another day? We made plans ten days ago; I 
can't just switch things up now. There are too many people 
involved.
NAJMEH
Rezvan, your family should be your priority.
The sound of moving the chair draws the attention.
NAJMEH
Sana, dear, didn't I say Dad is sleeping?
Sana glances at her mother and then sits at the table.
SANA
I got it. what happened now that we are going to have a 
celebration and a meeting at the same time?
NAJMEH
I can only say it’s good news. In all these twenty-two years 
with your father, I was waiting for a day like this.
Sana nods.
REZVAN
Mom, you're killing us! Just tell us what it is!
NAJMEH
Tonight, at the restaurant.

      6. INT./EXT. GARDEN RESTAURANT – Night
Restaurant's yard.
In the outdoor area of a traditional garden restaurant, a few
gazebos are arranged in a row not too far from each other. The 
gazebos are covered with semi-transparent curtains. The sound of 
traditional Iranian music can be heard. The waiters come and go 
between the gazebos with trays of food in their hands.
In gazebo.
Sana, Rezvan, Najmeh, and Iman are sitting around a table and 
eating.
IMAN
When a case is presented in court, there should be 
investigations to collect correct and complete data. The 
collection of this information is the responsibility of several 
specialists who are trusted by the judicial system. These people 
must remain anonymous.
REZVAN
Why?
IMAN
Because they are at risk, both themselves and their families.
REZVAN
what risk?
IMAN
Most cases have a winner and a loser. The loser might think that 
they've become a victim of interpersonal conflicts, partiality, 
or anything unfair during the process of their case. Then they 
may decide to take revenge.
SANA
Well, the risks persist even now that you've become a judge. 
What made you decide to share the truth?

      IMAN
First of all, it is better to say an investigating judge. The 
investigating judge is the first judge of the case. Second, we 
decided to tell you because you’ve grown up now. You can 
understand the situation and act responsibly and appropriately.
NAJMEH
There are also things that you should be careful about, more 
than before. As it may impact your Dad negatively.
SANA
like what?
NAJMEH
For example, your hijab. Like the photos, you post on Instagram. 
Most of the social behavior that others see. Some people might 
see and report them. It will be bad for Dad.
REZVAN
We only hang out with Dad's friends.
NAJMEH
I'm talking exactly about them.
SANA
What does my Instagram have to do with Dad? also, one can use 
Instagram with a fake account.
NAJMEH
That's what I'm talking about. You should know how to act 
properly. You should know where to go, who to hang out with, 
what to wear, what to say or not to say.
7. INT. APT. GIRLS’ ROOM - NIGHT
The girls’ bedroom is rather small, with a bunk bed, a small 
desk, and a closet. Sana and Rezvan are lying in their beds. 
Sana in the top bunk, is lying down in reverse so that she speak 
with Rezvan face to face.

      SANA
Look, every year on the first day of school, teachers ask what 
is your father's job? I used to say an employee until now. What 
should I say when schools start on Saturday?
REZVAN
Just like before, you have to say an employee.
SANA
No way genius...so what’s the difference now?
REZVAN
There's no difference. just that before you weren't responsible 
for protecting information, now you are.
SANA
Why bother telling us then?
REZVAN
You don't care if your father is an important person?
SANA
No
REZVAN
Seriously?
SANA
What does my father's job have to do with me?
REZVAN
are you messing with me right now?
SANA
No, honestly. It really doesn't matter.

      REZVAN
I mean, wouldn't you care if Dad was selling cigarettes in the 
streets right now?

Is it important to you?
REZVAN
Of course, it's important.
Sana shrugs her shoulders and lies down.
8. INT. PROSECUTOR’S OFFICE, SUBMISSION CORRIDOR- DAY
With a paper in his hand, Iman passes through the submission 
corridor and enters Qaderi’s office. 
IMAN
what is this?
Iman passes the paper to Qaderi. After reading the text, Qaderi
pauses a moment.
QADERI
It’s clear…
IMAN
But I haven't read the file yet.
QADERI
Whether you read it or not, you must write the sentence and sign 
it. It’s the prosecutor's order.
Iman anxiously looks at Qaderi.
IMAN
I can't do that; I swore for justice!
Shocked and speechless, Qaderi looks at Iman for a few moments. 
After a pause, he writes something on a piece of paper and puts

      it on the table so that Iman can read it. Iman looks at the 
paper. It reads “Listening bugs”. Iman looks at Qaderi, Qaderi 
points to the room with his head. Iman, realizing his own 
carelessness, looks around.
QADERI
I recommend you read the judges’ oath once more.
Iman doesn’t know what to say. Qaderi picks up his pack of
cigarettes from the table and gets up.
QADERI
Cigarette?
Iman looks at Qaderi.
9. EXT. THE COURTHOUSE YARD- DAY
In a corner of the yard, Iman and Qaderi are standing together 
and smoking. In the background, now and again soldiers or 
plainclothes paramilitaries pass, transferring blindfolded
prisoners.
QADERI
Do you think you became an investigating judge overnight?
Qaderi takes a drag on his cigarette.
QADERI
The boss doesn't like you. He was against your transfer here 
right from the beginning. He wanted to bring his person. I 
insisted. And now he’s waiting for the tiniest mistake on your 
part.
Qaderi puffs on his cigarette. Iman is distressed and confused.
QADERI
Are you trying to undermine me? Or do you want to turn your back 
on your own progress and success, your wife and children? Do you 
know how many people were trying to be an investigating judge in 
this office? How many years you’ve been waiting to be a judge? 
Iman, here you have to fight. You have to prove yourself,

      especially in this case which is a direct order from the 
prosecutor.
IMAN
But I haven't even read the case, how can I issue a punishment
for "waging war against God”? and request a death penalty?
QADERI
Prosecutor's order... is the law, do you understand?
 Iman is deep in his thoughts.
10. INT./EXT. TAILOR’S SHOP AND BAZAAR - DAY
In a tailor’s workshop in the bazaar, where a middle-aged lady 
offers services to several young women and girls. 
Wearing a school uniform, Sana opens the door of a fitting room. 
Sadaf and Rezvan look at her.
Rezvan
It’s so nice.
Sadaf pauses and looks more carefully.
SADAF
Look at her shoulders... it doesn’t fit her well...
Sana checks the uniform’s shoulders in the mirror. Away from 
Sana’s eyes, Sadaf softly whispers something in Rezvan's ear.
SADAF
It’s also very baggy in the front.
Rezvan looks at Sana.
SADAF
should I tell her?
Rezvan
Yeah.

      SADAF
Dear ma’am...
TAILOR
Yes, my darling?
SADAF
Thank you very much, it looks very beautiful, but it doesn’t fit 
well on her shoulders and the front is too baggy. The shape of 
her chest can't be seen at all.
The tailor walks toward Sana. She tries to arrange the shoulders 
and the front of the dress.
TAILOR
First of all, not chest, they’re boobs. The chest is somewhere 
else. If the front of the dress is tighter than this, they will 
get in trouble at school. And what difference does it make in 
how it will fit? It is covered by the headscarf, no one would 
see it anyway.
SADAF
You are right, but please fix it.
TAILOR
My dear, this is a school uniform, not a party dress!
SADAF
but what would be the problem if her school uniform fit her well 
too?
The tailor nods and points to Sana.
TAILOR
Take it off, sweety.
SADAF
Now that you’re working on it, you’re going to fix the front 
too, right?

      TAILOR
don't come back later to tell me the school said it’s too tight.
REZVAN (to Sadaf)
let that one go.
SANA
What do you mean? No way! I don't like it to be loose like this.
REZVAN
Please fix the front as well. Thank you.
The tailor nods.
REZVAN
When will it be ready?
TAILOR
Call me next week if it is ready you can come to pick it up.
SANA
Ma’am, school will start next week.
TAILOR
What can I do, dear? I'm very busy.
SADAF
Please make it work.
Rezvan's phone rings. Seeing her mother's name, Rezvan steps 
away from the crowd to answer. The conversation between Sadaf, 
the tailor, and Sana continues.
REZVAN
Hello mom… No, we are at the tailor’s, it's not bad, it only
looked a bit puffy on her shoulders, but she’ll fix it… No, 
we'll be there in an hour, an hour and a half… Ok... do you 
remember Sadaf is also with Sana and me… but I told you last 
week…

      Worried that Sadaf will hear this conversation, Rezvan slowly 
increases her distance.
REZVAN
What do you mean Mom? First of all, I told you beforehand. 
Besides that, Sadaf came from her town and her dorm is not ready 
yet. She doesn’t have anyone here. You agreed in advance and 
told her she could stay the night at our place.
Sana approaches Rezvan.
SANA
what happened?
Rezvan shakes her head, emphasizing that it’s not important. She
moves away from Sana.
REZVAN
Mom, I told you. Now, why are you so strict about Sadaf all of a 
sudden? … Okay.
11. EXT. BAZAAR- DAY
In the market Sana, Rezvan, and Sadaf are walking together among 
the crowd, going from one shop to another.

13. INT. APT. KITCHEN. NAJMEH’S BEDROOM- DAY
Kitchen.
Rezvan, Sadaf, and Sana are in the kitchen, doing the dishes. 
Sadaf is washing, Rezvan rinses and Sana dries and puts them 
away. While working together, they start talking about what 
happened at the tailor's shop and the tailor's personality. 
Najmeh comes out of the room and calls Rezvan. Rezvan stops 
washing the dishes, dries her hands, and goes to her mother's 
bedroom.
Najmeh’s bedroom. Continuous.
Rezvan enters the bedroom.
REZVAN
Yes, Mom.
NAJMEH
My darling, did your friend eat her food?
Rezvan, surprised, looks at Najmeh.
NAJMEH
I made tea as well. Drink it, stay together for half an hour, 
then she needs to go, please.
REZVAN
What do you mean Mom? What's going on? do you even hear what I'm 
saying? her dormitory is not ready, and she doesn't have anyone 
in Tehran. Do you want to throw her out of the house?
NAJMEH
My dear, tell me what was she going to do if she didn't have a 
friend named Rezvan?
    

p. 19

      REZVAN
Well, she has one now.
NAJMEH
We talked about it. I explained to both of you that the 
circumstances of our family have changed, and we have to be 
careful.
REZVAN
Careful about what?
NAJMEH
About those around us.
REZVAN
In what possible way is Sadaf dangerous for us?
NAJMEH
Why do you think Sadaf is my problem? I'm saying you should 
change your way of life. If you can't tell her, I will go and 
talk to her myself.
Rezvan looks at Najmeh. The look on her face shows she’s 
restraining her anger.
REZVAN
Then let me talk to Dad myself and ask for his permission for 
Sadaf to stay tonight.
NAJMEH
Rezvan, Dad is busy with work, we should not disturb him. Also, 
he entrusted me with such issues.
Rezvan is desperate.
REZVAN
So at least let her stay until the evening... In the meantime, I 
will tell her somehow.
Najmeh mulls it over.

      NAJMEH
Okay, dear. She stays until the evening.
Upset because of her mother's behavior, Rezvan is leaving the 
room.
REZVAN
Thanks.
Rezvan is about to leave the bedroom.
NAJMEH
Rezvan, why is it so important to you?
Rezvan looks at her mother.
REZVAN
Because she's my friend, she is alone here.
NAJMEH
Even if you solve her problem tonight, what's going to happen 
the next time her dormitory is not ready?
REZVAN
I don't know, mom. I thought you wouldn't have a problem if she 
stayed with us for one night, so I told her she could stay here 
with us. Tomorrow, they will give her a room in the dormitory.
NAJMEH
OK, I'll let her stay tonight on two conditions.
Hora happily runs towards Najmeh.
REZVAN
What conditions?
NAJMEH
The first condition is that you promise it's the last time you 
make such a request again. The second is that you make sure

      Sadaf does not leave the room from the moment Dad comes home 
until he leaves early in the morning. I don't want her to see 
your father.
REZVAN
No problem, mom.
Rezvan rushes out of the room.
14. INT. GIRLS’ BEDROOM - DAY (EVENING)
In the kids’ room, Najmeh is plucking Rezvan's eyebrows. Sadaf 
is painting Sana's nails. Rezvan is looking at her eyebrows in a 
small hand mirror.
REZVAN
Mom, this is still too thick, make it thinner.
NAJMEH
If you make it any thinner, you will be like a slut.
SADAF
Auntie... my eyebrows are thin... but swear to God, I'm not a 
bad girl.
NAJMEH
Oh my God! Of course, not. I didn't mean you. I'm just saying 
that Rezvan is still a daughter of this house. She should be 
more mindful. Whenever she gets married, according to her 
husband's taste, she can do whatever she wants.
REZVAN
So even later I have to do whatever my husband wants? When will 
I do anything for myself?
To show that she is complying with her wishes, Najmeh plucks a 
few more strands of hair from Rezvan's eyebrow.
NAJMEH
Don't move so much.

      SADAF
Although Rezvan, keep in mind that full and natural eyebrows are 
fashionable now.
REZVAN
Mom, are you plucking my eyebrows for real? I don't feel 
anything.
As an answer to Rezvan, Najmeh plucks out a hair. Rezvan sighs.
REZVAN
Mom, when should I highlight my hair?
NAJMEH
What do you want to do with such beautiful hair? Don't you hear 
Sadaf saying that natural is fashionable?
Painting Sana's nails is finished, now Sadaf is busy sticking a 
fake nose stud on Sana's nose.
REZVAN
Mom! She says natural eyebrows are fashionable.
SANA
I want to dye my hair blue this summer anyway.
NAJMEH
If you turn your hair blue, I sure will turn your life black.
Kids laugh.
NAJMEH
Also, you're going to remove your nail polish tonight before 
your dad comes. I don't want to deal with such trouble.
SANA
Mom, why are you doing this, don't you dye your hair yourself?

      NAJMEH
Do you understand the difference between a girl and a married 
woman?
With her painted nails, Sana puts her hands on her face and 
makes a silly face. Rezvan laughs and because of Rezvan's 
laughter, Najmeh looks at Sana.
NAJMEH
What are you doing?
Najmeh's phone rings. Seeing Iman's name, Najmeh gets up in a 
hurry and leaves the room. Rezvan comes toward Sana. Sadaf takes 
out a lipstick from her bag and starts rubbing it on Sana's 
lips.
SADAF
Let me make you pretty...Rezvan...Does your mom hate me?
REZVAN
Why would you say that?
SADAF
Don't you see that she is constantly throwing shades at me?
REZVAN
No, come on! She doesn't mean you. She is worried about Sana's 
behavior.
Sana with curly hair, a stud on her nose, and a bright lipstick 
on her lips, while holding her hands so that her nail polish is 
visible, pretend to be dancing Bandari. Rezvan and Sadaf are 
laughing.
15. INT.LIVING ROOM- MIDNIGHT
Najmeh has fallen asleep on the sofa. The TV is on. After a few 
moments, the sound of the key turning in the lock is heard, 
followed by the opening of the door. Najmeh wakes up. Iman 
enters confused and tired. Seeing him, Najmeh goes towards him.

      NAJMEH
It’s very late.
Exhausted, Iman hands his bag to Najmeh and without saying a 
word, goes to the bathroom.
NAJMEH
Are you okay?
Iman nods and enters the bathroom. Najmeh runs to the room. She
puts the bag down and pauses for a moment. Then she turns toward
the bathroom. She tries to enter but the bathroom door is 
locked. She knocks on the door several times but doesn’t get any
response.
16. INT. APT. BATHROOM - MIDNIGHT
In the shower, Iman is holding his face under the water. Drops 
of water are hitting his face.
Iman is standing in a corner and staring at the ground with his 
hand stretched out as support. Water is dripping from his face. 
He picks up and wears his towel. It seems that he is trying to 
calm down. He leaves the bathroom. A bit farther in the 
background, we can see a gun that Iman left next to the sink.
17. INT. BEDROOM- NIGHT
In the darkness of the room, Iman is standing near the window 
and staring out. Najmeh arrives with a tray of hot food. She
puts food on a plate for Iman and tries to feed him. Iman 
doesn’t eat any. Eventually, Najmeh stops trying.
NAJMEH
What’s going on, honey?
In silence, Iman is looking out the window.
NAJMEH
Why don't you tell me?

      Iman looks at Najmeh.
IMAN
Why do you think they chose me as an investigating judge?
Looking at Iman, Najmeh waits for him to continue.
IMAN
They think I will do whatever they ask me.
NAJMEH
Who?
IMAN
The previous investigating judge was fired when he did not sign 
the execution sentence of a defendant... Why didn't he sign it? 
Maybe the accused is innocent.
Najmeh doesn’t know what to say. She is fretful.
NAJMEH
Did they ask you to do something?
Iman stares into Najmeh's eyes for a while.
IMAN
They want me to sign off on that death penalty sentence.
NAJMEH
Unjust execution?
IMAN
I don’t know.
NAJMEH
Do not sign that.
Iman looks at Najmeh.

      IMAN
The prosecutor's order is... the law.
NAJMEH
So, if the prosecutor gave the order, it has nothing to do with 
you, right?
IMAN
Qaderi says this is the original verdict... if there is any
defect in the case, then there is a retrial, and after that the 
court of appeal... and then the resumption of proceedings...
A noise comes from the children's room. Najmeh becomes restless.

Let it go for now. Let's go and rest.
18. INT. APT. KITCHEN TO BEDROOM – NIGHT
On a plate, Najmeh puts a glass of water next to a pill and goes 
toward the bedroom. On her way, she notices that one of the 
girls has been in the bathroom and is now going back to their 
room, closing the door. Najmeh can’t tell who it was. She enters 
the bedroom, gives Iman a pill, and puts him to sleep. After 
pulling the blanket over him, Najmeh goes to the bathroom. 
In the bathroom, she starts collecting Iman's clothes. Suddenly, 
she notices the gun that Iman left there on the dresser. 
Terrified, Najmeh looks out the door, making sure no one is 
there. She picks up the gun and puts it in the dirty laundry. 
Sneaking out of the bathroom, she goes back to the bedroom. Iman
is in deep sleep. Najmeh puts the gun in the drawer next to him. 
She comes out of the room again with the dirty laundry and goes 
toward the washing machine. As she is putting the clothes in the 
washing machine one by one, she suddenly notices a blood-like 
stain on Iman's shirt. She thinks about it for a while, but soon 
she decides to look the other way and throws the rest of the 
laundry in the washing machine.

20. INT. APT. LIVING ROOM- DAY
Najmeh, Rezvan, and Sana are in the living room. Rezvan and Sana 
are sitting on each corner of the sofa, with their phones in 
their hands. Something’s off about the situation. While drinking 
tea, Najmeh is watching the TV report of the protests. A one￾sided report from Iran's state television describes the 
protesters as violent agitators and rioters. Rezvan too is
watching the reports carefully. But Sana is on her phone 
watching the protest footage recorded by people, without paying 
attention to the TV. Now and then she takes a glance at the TV, 
and at Rezvan and Najmeh, who are attentively following the 
report. Sana copies the link to the video she’s watching and 
sends it to Rezvan. Rezvan notices she received a text. Seeing 
Sana's name, she is surprised that she is only a few steps away 
but still has sent a text message. Only by using eye gestures,
Rezvan asks her what the link is. Away from Najmeh's eyes, Sana 
responds with a look that she must check out the link. 
Rezvan opens the link and watches the video. Sana writes a 
message to Rezvan, saying “Do you see how they are beating up
people? But look what they’re showing on TV! They’re constantly 
lying”. Rezvan responds with a sad emoji. Sana writes "Sadaf 
didn't reach the dormitory?" Rezvan writes “No, she hasn’t 
texted me yet”. Sana sends her another video. Rezvan watches. 
The plainclothesmen forces are beating up a girl who’s

The image on Rezvan’s mobile screen cuts to documentary videos 
of police violence against women.(recorded with mobile phones)
21. INT./EXT. APT. BEDROOM. LIVINGROOM – NIGHT
Living room.
With its tall windows, the apartment looks like a prison from 
the outside. While holding her phone (on speaker), Najmeh is 
waiting behind the living room window for Iman to answer his
phone. Death to the dictator chant can be heard from outside. 
Although the number of chanters is not many, these voices get 
Najmeh thinking. Her call remains unanswered, and she closes the 
window. Restless and nervous, she walks toward the stove and 
turns off the burner.
Girls’ room.
Rezvan and Sana are listening to the slogans through the window. 
Rezvan's phone rings.
REZVAN
Sadaf!
Rezvan answers. Sana asks her to put it on speaker. Rezvan does 
so.
REZVAN
Are they chanting there too?
SADAF
Yes, many are!
Through the phone, you can hear people shouting death to the
dictator close by. Sadaf is speaking with excitement and joy. 
Occasionally, she bursts into laughter with happiness as she 
speaks.
REZVAN

      SADAF

Sadaf stays silent for a moment. Students’ chants can be heard 
through the phone.
SANA
Did you chant as well?
SADAF
I chanted and took off my scarf too.
REZVAN
no way!
SANA
Bravo!
Sana and Rezvan are excited. Sadaf shouts death to the dictator. 
Her voice is very loud on the phone. Rezvan, afraid of her voice 
being heard, cancels the speaker mode, and holds the phone to 
her ears.
REZVAN
What are you doing Sadaf? My mom will show up now.
Sadaf laughs.
SADAF
See how many files I’ve sent. Go and watch them.
REZVAN
Everything has been filtered since this evening though.

22. INT. APT. LIVING ROOM – NIGHT
Rezvan and Sana are having dinner with Najmeh.
REZVAN
It is not possible to stay home all the time.
NAJMEH
You’ve been staying home for just one day now, what’s all this 
fuss about? Don't you see what's going on?
SANA
what's going on Mom? People are living their lives.
NAJMEH
Why do you two think you understand everything better than me 
and your father? is this life? Breaking the glass, setting
things on fire.
REZVAN
It's not all about breaking glass and setting things on fire. 
People are protesting. They don't let them protest, they break 
the glass, throw tear gas at them, and start a fire.
Najmeh gives Rezvan a fierce glare.
NAJMEH
Well, great! Now you’ve become the defender of the rioters.

Be quiet, I wanna see what the news says.
Away from the dinner table, Najmeh is watching the news on TV… 
It is not only Najmeh who is caught up in the images and the 
reports. Rezvan is also watching carefully.
REZVAN
Did they really kill someone because of hijab?
Najmeh looks at her.
NAJMEH
She had a stroke. It says that she’s been sick already.
REZVAN
Who knows?
NAJMEH
He is saying it on TV.
SANA
Whatever they say on TV is true?
NAJMEH
No, whatever you say is true! Listen, it’s saying that she had a 
heart problem. She had a stroke while in the custody of the 
morality police.
REZVAN
Well, she must have been so scared that she ended up having a 
stroke.
NAJMEH
Thousands of people have heart attacks every day, is it the 
government's fault?

      REZVAN
Thousands of people are not having heart attacks out of fear 
from the police.
SANA
Would you say the same thing if she was your own daughter?
NAJMEH
My daughter wouldn’t dare to go out dressed like that.
REZVAN
Why should someone be arrested for their clothes in the first 
place?
NAJMEH
Because it is God's order. It is the law of the land.
SANA
Well, maybe the law is wrong.
NAJMEH
God's law is infallible.
REZVAN
Who assured you that this is God's law anyway?
NAJMEH
What’s going on with you two? Well go on then, get up and go
start chanting in the street. Go and dance bareheaded in the 
middle of the street. Your father has no idea what is going on 
in this house.
Najmeh leaves the dinner table. Rezvan and Sana are astonished
by Najmeh's irrational behavior.
SANA
What is she saying? Why does she act like that?

23. INT. BEDROOM- MIDNIGHT
Iman and Najmeh are in bed. They talk softly in the dark of the 
room.
NAJMEH
The kids have grown up. They have ideas and questions. They need 
you. You know what? I don't want anything from you. But a girl 
at this age needs her father, they get bored...
IMAN
It’s gonna be like this just for a short while, it will be ok.
Schools and universities are about to begin as well, kids will 
be busy studying. Be patient a bit longer.
Najmeh pauses for a moment.
NAJMEH
Iman…
IMAN
Yes, my darling?
NAJMEH
Did you sign off on that death penalty sentence?
IMAN
Yeah...
Taken by surprise, Najmeh turns toward Iman.
IMAN
I thought about it a lot. I was being 
emotional. I mixed my ego's desires with the 
execution of God's decree.
With these explanations, Najmeh is reassured.

A self-sacrifice is necessary, to be able to

Resurrection.” 
In silence, Najmeh is eagerly listening to Iman's words.
NAJMEH
Did you fall asleep?
Iman answers drowsily.
IMAN
I’m about to.
NAJMEH
I know now is not a good time, but we may not be able to talk 
again soon.
IMAN

NAJMEH
Remember you promised to buy a dishwasher in a good opportunity? 
The hands of me and the girls are getting damaged. Can't we do

Najmeh, Sana, and Rezvan are driving to school. Sana is wearing 
the uniform and scarf that we’ve seen before. Rezvan is also 
wearing clothes suitable for the university, with a full hijab. 
Radio broadcasts a live show about the first day of school.
NAJMEH
Did you take your fruit and sandwich?
SANA
Yes, Mom. I did.
NAJMEH
Water bottle? I left it in the fridge for you last night.
SANA
No, I forgot that.
NAJMEH
Do I have to remind you about that too? Buy mineral water, don't

NAJMEH
Rezvan, weren’t you supposed to keep a proper distance from your 
friends?
REZVAN
Ma, Sadaf is my only friend.
NAJMEH
Am I saying she can’t be your friend? I say be careful because 
of your father’s job conditions.
REZVAN
Mom, I don't understand. What do you exactly mean by Dad's job
conditions? What conditions does it have?
NAJMEH
Dad's work is sensitive. Just like your uncle. Your uncle is 
always traveling, right? But does anyone know where he is? Do 
you know exactly what your uncle's job is? I don't know, and I’m 
his sister. I only know that he is in the military.
REZVAN
After all, is Dad a judge, an investigating judge, or a military 
man?
NAJMEH
I’m saying his job is just as sensitive. We should not draw too 
much attention to ourselves. When you get close to people, you 
might say something by accident that you shouldn’t. Why did you 
plan last night to pick up Sadaf today?

On the other hand, unfortunately, this chaos coincided with the

more room in prisons. They’re asking us to clarify the status of 
the detainees as soon as possible. In a minute or two, I should 
be able to explain the charges and make a decision. One hundred,
two hundred, or three hundred a day... I don't know.

IMAN
The government closed them for the time being, but they are not 
going to announce it.
Rezvan suddenly rushes out of the bedroom.
REZVAN
Mom… mom…
Seeing her father, Rezvan greets him briefly and mindlessly.
REZVAN
Hi dad, how are you?
Mom, would you come here for a second?
IMAN
Did something happen?
NAJMEH
Yes, dear. Go, I'm right behind you.
Najmeh tries to reassure Iman.
NAJMEH
It's okay, they must have had an argument, I'll be back quickly.
Najmeh follows Rezvan to their bedroom.
Room.
Najmeh enters the room. Stunned, Sana is sitting on her bed and 
looks at Najmeh and Rezvan. Rezvan shows a video to Najmeh on 
her phone. In the video, which seems to have been recorded
secretly, the plainclothesmen are forcefully taking Sadaf away 
from the dorm.
NAJMEH
what is this?

      REZVAN
You see? I told you not to let her go. Girls from the dormitory 
recorded this video. They took Sadaf.
Najmeh stays silent for a while. She returns the phone to 
Rezvan.
NAJMEH
Don’t you see that I was right? If she stayed here, now they 
were raiding our house! Then what could you tell your father?
Rezvan is leaving the room.
REZVAN
I’ll talk to Dad myself.
Najmeh stops her.
NAJMEH
Where are you going? 
Wait, what are you doing?
REZVAN
I want to talk to Dad.
NAJMEH
what do you want to say?
REZVAN
I want to know where they took her. No one knows who they were, 
or where they took her. What has Sadaf done?
NAJMEH
Quiet. Do you think your father knows about these things?
SANA
who knows then?
Najmeh just noticed Sana’s presence. She looks at her.

      You're just a kid. Why do you interfere in these matters? Well,
both of you, listen carefully. This girl must have done 
something, the agents do not arrest someone for no reason, 
especially like this.
REZVAN
She didn't do anything; I was with her.
NAJMEH
This is the last time you say you were with her. You weren’t 
with her anywhere!
Iman’s voice can be heard from outside.
IMAN
Najmeh...
Najmeh notices he’s calling, and she responds loudly.
NAJMEH
I’m coming.
She turns toward the kids and starts speaking quietly, in a
stern and scolding tone.
NAJMEH
I will follow up tomorrow morning first thing through an 
acquaintance. Wherever she is, I will find her by noon. Don’t 
worry. Cell phones are off, now! go back to sleep.
Najmeh turns off the light and leaves the room. She closes the 
door behind her. The room plunges into darkness.
31. INT. GIRLS’ BEDROOM- NIGHT
Sana is in Rezvan's bed. They are watching videos of the 
protests together. Some of the videos excite them. Some make
them sad. The light of the phone screens shines on their faces.
“The image cuts to documentary videos (recorded with mobile 
phones). The footages shows the widespread crackdown on

of demonstrators.”
32. INT./EXT. NAJMEH’S CAR. STREET – DAY
Najmeh is driving in the street. While passing by, she sees
clashes breaking between people and the repression forces. 
Najmeh turns into an alley and stops a little later. She takes 
out her phone and sends a text message. Several vans enter from 
the other side of the alley and then enter a house’s parking
space. Najmeh looks at the vans. It’s not possible to see inside 
of the vans. From the same ordinary house, comes out a woman
wearing a chador and a mask on her face. She looks around and 
sees Najmeh’s car. The woman comes toward the car and then gets 
in. Najmeh and her friend, Faati, kiss and say hello.
NAJMEH
how are you honey, how is Alireza?
FAATI
We are not doing bad, thank God. You’ve seen the situation
yourself.
Faati points to the vans.
FAATI
Alireza said Iman has become an investigating judge at the 
prosecutor's office. Congratulations.
NAJMEH
Yes, thank you, dear. What can I say, until now it has been 
nothing but trouble. He is so caught up...
FAATI
Don't be ungrateful, do you know how much his salary will
increase? He will only stay at the prosecutor's office for a 
year or two. God willing, he will soon be transferred to the 
Revolutionary Court and become the head judge of the branch. 
Wow, do you know what it's like to be a judge’s wife? If he 
becomes a judge, your situation will be even better than it is.

FAATI
We are busy here from morning to night. You don't know what's 
going on. They keep bringing people in.
NAJMEH
yes, I heard. To be honest, I’m here about something related. 
the daughter of an acquaintance was arrested too and there’s no 
sign of her.
FAATI
when they arrested her?
NAJMEH
Last night. They raided the university dormitory. They took her 
as well. her family is from another town.
FAATI
Who were they? Plainclothesmen or anti-riot?
NAJMEH
Apparently, plainclothesmen.
FAATI
If they were plainclothesmen, God help us. She can’t be found 
this soon.
NAJMEH
To be honest, she was shot and injured a few hours before the 
arrest, that's why her family is very worried about her and I’m
disturbing you. I thought maybe you could take a look in your 
system and tell us where she is...
 Faati pauses a little.
FAATI
I can't promise anything, but give me her name, details, and 
National ID Number and I'll see what I can do.

      Two more vans arrive to enter the safe house. Seeing the vans, 
Faati decides to leave. She remembers something before getting 
off.
FAATI
My dear, I have to go, you see what's going on.
NAJMEH
Thank you so much, thank you for your time.
FAATI
Dear Najmeh, I don't want to pry, but be more careful. These 
friends and acquaintances who make such demands of you... their 
children will go to riots, something happens to them, then they 
suddenly think...
Najmeh is surprised by Faati's words.
FAATI
Truth be told, some godless people have been identifying names, 
addresses, phone numbers, and details of investigating judges
and judges, and in short, anyone who is serving this system. And 
they are posting them on Instagram, Facebook, and cyberspace, 
whatever. From there, it gets to enemy networks. Please don’t 
get upset but be careful. Do not hang out with everyone.
 Confused, Najmeh is looking at Faati.
NAJMEH
No, you are right, we’re careful.
FAATI
great dear, say hello.
NAJMEH
Excuse me, Faati, can you please not tell Alireza that I asked 
you this? I'm afraid he tells Iman and then Iman gets upset
about it. Don't even say we met. I don't want anyone to know.

33. INT. APT- DAY
Najmeh enters the apartment. Sana and Rezvan run towards her.
REZVAN
what happened?
NAJMEH
They need her National ID Number.
REZVAN
How can we find her ID Number?
NAJMEH
I don't know, you talk as if it's my fault they arrested her.
She went out in the streets, broke banks’ windows, set tires on 
fire, and did whatever she wanted. It’s her fault, she chose 
this herself. Call her family.
REZVAN
Mom, don’t you understand what I'm saying, I was with her, she 
didn't do anything.
SANA
Mom, Rezvan was standing beside her. Those pellets could’ve hit
Rezvan’s eyes.
NAJMEH
Rezvan doesn’t dare to get in trouble, joining a riot. These are 
a bunch of thugs coming to the streets to run naked.

      Rezvan's phone rings. Rezvan answers.
REZVAN
Hello, is there any news? () unfortunately, no, my search was 
also unsuccessful.
Najmeh starts listening carefully to the conversation.
REZVAN
Now we need her National ID Number to continue the search () ask 
others, maybe someone has it () OK then, I’m waiting, send it to 
me.
Rezvan hangs up the phone. Burning with anger, Najmeh turns
Rezvan.
NAJMEH
what the hell are you doing? Who were you talking to?
REZVAN
Mom, what are you talking about? I was speaking to my classmate.
NAJMEH
Did you tell someone you can do something? Did you talk about 
your father?
REZVAN
What do you mean?
NAJMEH
You’re playing dumb? What did you tell your friends? Did you say
how are you looking for her?
REZVAN
I did not mention Dad’s name or his job.
NAJMEH

      REZVAN
I said my uncle has an acquaintance.
Rezvan goes toward her room. Najmeh follows her.
NAJMEH
You had no right to mention your uncle's name. I swear to God, 
if I find out you said one word about your father… or your 
uncle…
REZVAN
I did not say anything to anyone. I know what to say and what 
not to say. I swear I leave this house and go away.
NAJMEH
Wow! Since when do you say such things? Where do you think you 
are? Do you think you can do whatever you want?
Rezvan closes the door of the room. Najmeh knocks on the door.
NAJMEH
Do not close the door.
SANA
Mom, for god’s sake, let it go.
NAJMEH
What? Let it go? do you think you can do whatever in this house?
I will tell your father everything tonight, then it’s between
you and him.
Najmeh goes to her room. Confused, Sana leans against the wall.
34. INT. APT. KITCHEN- DAY (NEARLY NIGHT)
Najmeh and Sana are in the kitchen, cooking. Najmeh's 
interactions with Sana are accompanied by boredom. She keeps 
telling Sana what to do. Sana patiently listens to her words and

Najmeh is alone in the living room. The lights are half lit. 
Najmeh is carefully watching the 9 o'clock news show on TV. She 
then turns off the TV and picks up her phone to call Iman, but 
she changes her mind. She goes to the kitchen. She turns off the 
stove burners and leaves the kitchen.
36. INT. NAJMEH’S BEDROOM- NIGHT
In the dark, Najmeh is standing by the window and listening to 
the sound of people chanting. It seems the number of people 
chanting is more than before, and the sound is very close now. 
She sticks her head out of the window to see which neighbor has 
joined the chanters. She listens for a while. Suddenly, Iman 
enters the room.
IMAN
what has happened?
Najmeh looks back.
NAJMEH
you came. I thought you forgot...
Iman nods. He seems very tired. He goes toward the drawer and
puts his bag in a corner.
NAJMEH
do you hear that? One of the neighbors is chanting...
Iman looks at Najmeh. He takes off his jacket and throws it on 
the bed. He takes out the gun from behind his back and puts it 
in the drawer. He then goes toward Najmeh.
IMAN

Now both of them are standing together near the window and 
listening to the slogan of death to the dictator.
NAJMEH
There are many, Iman. do you hear them?
They both listen for a while.
NAJMEH
What if something happens?
IMAN
Like what?
NAJMEH
I mean, you’ve never thought about it?
Iman is silent. It seems that the answer is he did but doesn’t
want to say it out loud.
NAJMEH
I’m afraid. What will they do to us if something happens?
Iman closes the window.
IMAN
Nothing’s going to happen...
NAJMEH
How can you be sure?
IMAN
We won’t allow it... whoever stands in the way of God’s religion
is responsible for his life.
Hearing Iman's words, Najmeh pauses a little.

In their room... they are upset. They arrested some of Rezvan's 
classmates.
Iman gets worried.
IMAN
Rezvan wasn’t in these riots, was she?
NAJMEH
No, she wasn't. But they took one of her close friends. she is 
worried about her and is very sad. She doesn’t come out of the 
room.
Iman takes a glance at Najmeh.
NAJMEH
Does anyone know who arrested them? 
Where do they take them?
IMAN
Why does Rezvan have such friends?
NAJMEH
My dear, she can't do an entry test for making friends. They met 
at the university and became close. The poor girl didn't do 
anything at all.

Now, can't you get any news about this child and relieve her
family from worry?
IMAN
How do I do that? God knows where she is now. 
They have to wait.
NAJMEH
For how long?
IMAN
Until she starts talking. They keep her in solitary until she 
sits in front of the camera and confesses everything.
NAJMEH
What to say when she didn't do anything?
Iman looks at Najmeh.
IMAN
There is always something to confess in front of the 
interrogators' cameras.
Najmeh thinks for a while.
NAJMEH
Does that mean you can't do anything?
IMAN
At this stage, no.

Iman, Najmeh, Rezvan, and Sana are sitting around the dinner 
table and having dinner. The TV is on and broadcasts government 
propaganda. Rezvan says something under her breath.
REZVAN
suffocating us with lies, turn it off, for God’s sake.
Iman notices Rezvan's protest.
IMAN
what did you say dear?
REZVAN
I asked if we could turn it off while eating dinner.
IMAN
No, you said one more thing before that.
REZVAN
I said they are lying all the time.
Najmeh says under her breath “God have mercy”. Iman is taken 
aback by the fact that Rezvan says this openly in front of him. 
He stops eating and tries to be cool and calm.
IMAN
Do you know all the facts?
REZVAN
I live in this country, I can see.
IMAN
what do you see? What the enemy wants? Don't you think these 
ideas are being fed to you?

Which enemy Dad? They beat my friends right in front of my eyes

Wait, I agree there are some flaws. But the main point is that 
you and people like you don't know that the world is united 
against us! These are all the enemy’s conspiracies.
REZVAN
Dad, what do I have to do with the unity of the world? What do I 
have to do with the enemy? A young girl my age was killed 
because of her hijab. Why?
IMAN
This! Your information is wrong, she was not killed, she had a 
stroke. But the enemy makes you think that she has been killed!
REZVAN
So why don't they let the issue be investigated openly? Why 
don't they let an independent fact-finding committee intervene? 
Are they killing so many people just to say they didn't kill 
that one person?
IMAN
Wait, you’re going too far. I have been serving this system for 
twenty years. Me, and thousands like me are trying to protect
this country from dawn to dusk, for whom? For you! Then you 
defend a series of thugs whose problem is getting naked in 
public?
REZVAN
Who wants to get naked? When did I defend getting naked?
IMAN
Those who are now in the streets.
REZVAN
Who are they, Dad? I happened to be in one of these protests
yesterday. My friend Sadaf and I were coming back from 
university, and out of nowhere, they shot her with metal pellets
in the face. Then they raided her dormitory and arrested her. 
Even if she survives, she’ll definitely lose sight of one of her 
eyes. They took away the beauty of her face, her future is
destroyed, why?

Where are they connected to? Ordinary people who want an 
ordinary life! You’ve closed your eyes on reality...
NAJMEH
Enough, don't argue with your father like that, have some 
respect.
IMAN
Not even as a father, but as someone who has been working in 
this system every day as long as you lived, don't I know what's 
going on better than you?
REZVAN
No, because you’re devoted to this system, you believe in it. 
You don't see its flaws.
Iman bangs on the table and gets up to leave.
IMAN
Enough, what's going on in this house?
Najmeh gets up and stops Iman from leaving.

Of course, I am sure.

up the laundry and I saw it there. Then I picked it up and put 
it in the drawer.
 Iman ponders for a bit.

Qaderi nods.

For now, neither report it nor talk about it with anyone.
Iman nods her head.

      REZVAN
what happened Mom? Until a few days ago, it was no one's fault 
that thousands of people had strokes every day. A stroke was 
just a stroke. Now today if Dad has a stroke, it is our fault?
NAJMEH
You have no shame...I came here to say you are playing with his 
professional reputation of twenty years. You are dishonoring 
him. If this gun is not found, your father should go to prison 
for three years!
SANA
Mom, why do you think we took it? Do you think it’s okay if I do 
the same to you and blame you for it?
Najmeh leaves the room.
47. INT. APT- NIGHT
Living room.
Rezvan and Sana are eating at the table. Najmeh is sitting far 
away on the sofa, holding a cushion in her arms and watching TV. 
Rezvan puts some food on a plate and takes it to Najmeh.
REZVAN
Mom, come on, eat something.
Najmeh shakes her head.
NAJMEH
I don’t want to.
REZVAN
Why?
Rezvan sits next to Najmeh.
NAJMEH
You do not understand what you two are doing to your father. If, 
like me, you grew up with an irresponsible father whose only

      concern was gambling and having fun, you would now kiss your 
father's feet once a day. You wouldn’t let him feel the 
slightest discomfort.
REZVAN
Mom, I understand that you had a rough childhood, but that is no 
reason to think that everything Dad says is true. Why would Sana 
and I take Dad's gun?
NAJMEH
So, the gun just vanished into thin air?
SANA
What if Dad is lying, did you see him bring the gun home with 
your own eyes?
REZVAN
You say that the gun was in the drawer, next to Dad's side of 
the bed. Who dares to come and take the gun from your drawer 
when you two are sleeping there?
SANA
There was no weapon, Dad is so busy he got confused. He gave 
away his gun somewhere else and prefers to say that someone took 
it at home.
Najmeh is thinking.
48. EXT. PROSECUTOR’S OFFICE. YARD- DAY
Iman and Qaderi are smoking in their usual spot in the yard.
QADERI
Your mistake was telling your wife and children what your job 
is.
IMAN

      QADERI
Yes, it is.
IMAN
For how long?
QADERI
Till you’re in the grave!
 Iman pauses.
IMAN
I’m stuck, I don’t know what to do.
QADERI
It's only natural. They don’t teach us in any university or 
classroom how an investigating judge should interrogate his wife 
and children! 
Iman pauses.
IMAN
I’m confused.
QADERI
Which one do you suspect the most?
IMAN
I can't believe that my children did this.
QADERI
Do you think it’s your wife?
IMAN
No, I trust her completely.
Qaderi pauses for a moment.

      QADERI
Really?
IMAN
Right now, I’m suspicious about everyone and everything.
QADERI
How can you live with doubts? Being afraid in your own house? 
There is a way that makes it easier. At least you understand how 
much you can trust your wife and children...
IMAN
what way?
QADERI
Alireza, take them to Alireza.
IMAN
Alireza?
QADERI
Yes, he studied for this. You know that in interrogation he is 
the best. He can use psychological interrogation techniques and 
tell you for certain who did it.
Iman takes a drag of his cigarette.
IMAN
How though? Alireza is my friend, he has been to our home many 
times. We’ve been to their place. His wife is friends with my 
wife. His children are friends with my children. How can I ask
him to interrogate them now?
QADERI
What is an interrogation? He asks a few questions, using 
psychological techniques and studying their body language, and 
then he tells you who has the gun! What’s wrong with that? Do 
you want everyone to find out what happened to the gun first? 
End this story quietly.

Do you have a safer person? Do you know a better way?
Iman stays silent and thinks it over.
49. INT. APT. LIVING ROOM- NIGHT
In the middle of the night, Najmeh and Iman are sitting far from 
the TV. The TV is on.
NAJMEH
Alireza and Faati are our friends, I don't want them to know 
about our family issues and private problems.
IMAN
I asked Alireza not to say anything to his wife.
NAJMEH
Iman, they are a married couple, they tell each other 
everything. Worse than that, do you want your children to be 
interrogated by your friend?
IMAN
They won’t even know it’s Alireza.
NAJMEH
Who can these children trust in the future? you? me? their 
friends?
IMAN
What do you suggest I should do then? Who can I trust? Can't you 
see I'm stuck? This house is poisoned with mistrust. Do you know 
what will happen if anyone finds out in the prosecutor’s office?
Do you know what will happen if they say that his children or 
his wife have stolen his weapon?
Najmeh stays silent.

      IMAN
We go to Alireza's office for half an hour, he asks a few

this.
Najmeh is restless. Iman takes her hands. They look into each 
other's eyes.
NAJMEH
Will they record it?
IMAN
Record it for what?
NAJMEH
You said yourself that they record the interrogations.
IMAN
No, there is no need to record it.
Najmeh hangs her head and gives in.
NAJMEH
I’m worried about this family.
IMAN
If I go to jail, what will happen to this family? Let's fix it.
50. EXT. IN FRONT OF THE SAFE HOUSE- DAY
Iman's car enters an alley and then stops at a corner. Najmeh, 
Rezvan, and Sana get out of the car. They go to a house nearby. 
Najmeh rings the doorbell. While sitting in the driver's seat, 
Iman looks at them waiting in front of the door. Sana looks at 
the CCTV camera which its angle of view is set on the entrance 
door. Rezvan is looking at her father in the car. The door 
opens. Rezvan and Sana enter. Najmeh looks at Iman before 
entering. Iman nods.

      51. INT. SAFE HOUSE- DAY
The entrance of the building to the hall.
Sana, Rezvan, and Najmeh pass through an x-ray screening device. 
A hijabed woman guides them inside. It seems the house tries to 
look like a place of living in a tasteless manner. Upon reaching 
the hall, the woman asks Rezvan, Sana, and Najameh to sit there 
and wait.
FEMALE AGENT
Sit here, I'll be back.
Rezvan nervously looks at Najmeh. But for Sana, everything seems 
to be normal. It is as if she has come to a doctor's office. A 
little later, the female agent comes to the hall and asks Sana 
and Rezvan to follow her. Rezvan looks at her mother again. With 
a nod, Najmeh asks her to follow the woman. Najmeh remains 
alone. Alireza comes a little later.
ALIREZA
Hello.
NAJMEH
Hello sir, how are you? How is dear Faati?
ALIREZA
Thank you very much. Can I take a moment of your time?
Najmeh, who is confused, doesn’t know what to say.
NAJMEH
Are you going to talk to me too?
ALIREZA
Just a few questions.
NAJMEH
Iman said you are only going to talk to the kids.
Alireza is now speaking in a commanding tone.

      ALIREZA
Please, come this way.
Reluctantly, Najmeh follows the way Alireza is showing to her.
Interrogation room.
There is nothing in the interrogation room except for two chairs 
with armrests. One of the two chairs is facing the wall. As soon 
as he enters, Alireza turns it around and places it in front of 
the other chair.
ALIREZA
please have a seat.
Najmeh and Alireza sit on each chair.
ALIREZA
You must know that I am here at your service due to Iman’s
request so that we can solve this problem with each other's 
help.
NAJMEH
yes, yes, I know.
ALIREZA
I generally do not mix professional issues and friendship, but 
sometimes friends have to help each other out.
NAJMEH
I’m very grateful. Thank you.
Alireza is observing Najmeh. He monitors the way she sits, her
hands, and her eyes.
Alireza starts writing on the paper in front of him.
ALIREZA
I ask you to please patiently and carefully, answer the 
questions that I am writing.

      NAJMEH
Honestly, I think it is very unlikely that the kids took the 
gun.
Alireza responds with a laugh.
ALIREZA
Usually, the culprit is someone who we can think of the least!
NAJMEH
It's not even about a crime. Iman has lost his gun somewhere 
else. You yourself know these days’ conditions better. You are 
all busy, and under pressure. Iman is very nervous too. 
Especially in the last few days, he had written several death 
penalty sentences, which mentally had a great impact on him.
ALIREZA
I understand. But Iman is sure that he brought the gun home and 
put it in its usual place.
NAJMEH
I know, he told me too.
ALIREZA
You know the impact of a lost gun on Iman’s career path.
NAJMEH
Of course, I know, but it is not okay that he insists the gun is 
missing in the house and that he suspects the kids took it. This 
really bothers me.
ALIREZA
What about you?
NAJMEH
What about me?
ALIREZA
It is not possible that you yourself know where the gun is?

      NAJMEH
what do you mean? You mean I took his gun?
ALIREZA
Anyway, in my job, this is a possibility.
NAJMEH
Wow, thank you for that… and many thanks to Iman…
ALIREZA
No, no, Iman told me that he trusts you one hundred percent. 
Please don’t be upset. You know better that sometimes there are 
secrets between children and their mothers.
NAJMEH
There is no such thing at all. If I know something, why should I 
hide it from my husband? In the past twenty-two years, I have 
always been completely transparent and honest with Iman.
ALIREZA
But I know there are some cases that Iman does not know about.
Najmeh thinks for a moment and suddenly, decides to leave. She 
gets up.
ALIREZA
Please sit down.
NAJMEH
No, your words are insulting.
ALIREZA
Please, I am talking to you with the utmost respect. This room 
has never seen such respect for the person who sits in that
chair. I assure you; whatever is said between us, won’t leave 
this room. I’m your confidant. I just wanted to say that this 
case can be similar to the issue you didn’t want to tell Iman 
for some reason.
With her silence, Najmeh conveys that she’s displeased.

      NAJMEH
You’re saying I don’t understand the disaster that is happening?
ALIREZA
It is important to tell me everything you know.
With the look on her face, it is obvious that Najmeh has 
surrendered to Alireza's wishes.
The other interrogation room.
This room is similar to the other room, only smaller. There are 
only two chairs with armrests. A chair is facing the wall and 
Rezvan is sitting on it. For a long time, Rezvan has been
staring at the wall without moving. She starts to read the 
writings on the wall. Salvation lies in honesty, God help me. 
Mother, forgive me... suddenly the female agent enters with a 
blindfold in her hand.
FEMALE AGENT
Don't turn around... cover your eyes with this.
Rezvan takes the blindfold and puts it over her eyes.
FEMALE AGENT
Pull it up a bit, so you can see in front of you. So you can 
write on the paper.
Rezvan does as the agent asks.
FEMALE AGENT
Don't move until I come back.
For a few moments, Rezvan remains alone. She does not move on 
the officer’s command. A little later, the female agent returns. 
After controlling the blindfolds and making sure Rezvan can't 
see anything, she points to Alireza to enter. Alireza enters and 
sits on a chair. He starts writing some questions on a piece of
paper.
Alireza writes: “Introduce yourself thoroughly”.
Alireza puts the paper along with the pen on the chair in front 
of Rezvan. Rezvan takes the pen and starts writing. Alireza

      stares at Rezvan's movements. A little later, Rezvan holds
the paper behind her head. Alireza takes the paper. He
takes a short time to read the paper, but then stares at 
Rezvan once more. A little later, Alireza starts writing 
again.
Alireza writes: “Explain fully and precisely where you were and 
what you were doing when the weapon went missing”.
Alireza puts the paper in front of Rezvan and Rezvan starts 
writing. Alireza is staring at her.
The other interrogation room.
This time it is Sana who is holding the piece of paper behind 
her head. Alireza takes the paper from her and takes a look at 
her answer. Then he watches Sana and her behavior. A little 
later he starts writing. He puts the paper in front of Sana. 
From Sana's point of view, we see the Alireza’s hands. As he 
places the paper in front of Sana, we see that he is wearing a 
unique agate ring on his finger. Seeing the ring, Sana pauses a 
little and then starts writing.
52. INT./EXT. IMAN’S CAR. TEHRAN’S STREETS- DAY
Iman, Najmeh, Rezvan, and Sana are in the car, driving in the 
streets of Tehran towards home. The girls are sitting in the

will put me in jail.
REZVAN
What does it have to do with me?
 Iman tries to stay calm.
IMAN
My dear, sometimes you do something exciting that with the 
passage of time you realize is wrong. But fear does not allow 
one to go back and admit their mistakes. But I want to assure 
you that you should not be afraid. Something has happened, and 
now we have to fix it. That’s it. Just hand over the gun and 
everything will be over.
REZVAN
Which gun, dad? Why don't you believe that I don't know anything 
about it? Does that mean you are ready to accuse me because of 
the words of a stranger?
 NAJMEH
So what happened to this gun? It just disappeared? where is it?

being destroyed. I will go to prison. do you want to hurt me? 
Why? Did you see anything but love and support from me? The best 
house, the best life...car, money. What else do you want?
Tears roll in Iman's eyes. Rezvan bursts into tears from the 
pressure, and while crying profusely, she defends herself.
REZVAN
I didn't take it, I swear. I didn't take it, I swear on my
grandmother’s grave, I didn't even know that Dad had a gun. I 
didn't take it, let me go. let me go...
Facing Rezvan’s tears, Iman sits on the sofa. Najmeh angrily 
rushes to the girls’ bedroom.
Girls' bedroom.
As soon as Najmeh enters the room, she starts searching the room

NAJMEH
Didn't you want to dye your hair blue? Your father is here, he 
promises to let you dye your hair blue. Tell her Iman, tell her
you allow her to do so.
IMAN
Yes, dear. I allow it. You can dye your hair and paint your 
nails. If you know anything, tell us. Look, Rezvan is not doing

At a gas station on the road, Iman is refueling the car. He

the line are staring at him and talking about him. Iman looks 
away, facing the opposite direction. A little later, he turns
his gaze to the car to make sure that the situation is safe. As 
he looks back, the young woman who is sitting in the passenger 
seat suddenly lowers her phone (which is filming). Seeing this, 
Iman is startled. He quickly finishes refueling and after 
paying, gets into his car without showing any reaction. After 
getting into the car, he sees in the mirror that they are 
filming and taking pictures of his car. Rezvan and Sana are 
sleeping in the back seat. But Najmeh notices the change in 
Iman's state. Iman starts the car and slowly leaves the gas 
station.
NAJMEH
Has something happened?
IMAN
No.
Najmeh looks behind her.
NAJMEH
I can tell by your state, did they recognize you?
Najmeh tries again to see the reaction of the passengers in the 
car behind them.

      IMAN
Do not turn around.
NAJMEH
what has happened?
Rezvan wakes up.
IMAN
They were filming us and taking photos.
Najmeh takes a mask towards Iman and hands a few masks to the 
back seat.
NAJMEH
put on your mask. Guys, wear a mask.
Sana wakes up.
SANA
What’s going on?
REZVAN
Here, wear a mask. While he was filling in the gas, a guy took 
photos and videos of him and the car.
Iman stops at a corner.
NAJMEH
Iman let's go. Please, didn't you say let's do something to end 
the problems?
IMAN
I will not allow anyone to harm me and my family.
Iman has parked his car in a corner and is waiting for the other
car to come out of the gas station. Now everyone is wearing a 
mask. Rezvan looks behind her. The car is still in the station.
NAJMEH
I swear on your father’s grave, let it go.

      REZVAN
Dad, come on. Let’s go. We’re not in the mood for another 
conflict.
Sana looks around silently. Iman watches the car leaving the gas 
station in the side mirror. The other car passes by without 
noticing Iman’s car. Iman waits for a while, then comes out of 
the parking spot. It enters the main road. Iman increases his
speed. Now it is at a proper distance from that car, and he 
tries to maintain this distance. Iman turns to Najmeh and points 
at the glove box.
IMAN
Glove box. Take out your phone.
Najmeh opens the glove box and takes out her mobile phone from a
plastic bag in which all phones are kept. she turns on the 
phone.
IMAN
First, take a photo from the back so the license plate can be 
seen clearly.
Najmeh does so.
IMAN
I’m going to drive beside their car. I’ll drive next to them;
you record their faces.
Iman increases the speed and suddenly changes direction and 
drives parallel to the other car. In response, the driver and 
passenger of the other car start filming Najmeh and Iman. 
Iman looks ahead, and as soon as he sees a side road, he
suddenly turns the stirring wheel and drives towards it, trying
to force the other car onto that road. 
The cars collide. With a few more hits, he now forces the other 
car to deviate to the right and drive on the dirt shoulder. 
After driving for some time on the dirt shoulder, the other car
tries in vain to return to the main road. It eventually has to 
turn to the side road. 
Missing the side road, Iman hits the brakes, reverses
immediately, and resumes the chase. Going down a path deep in

young man and a woman) get off and are waiting for Iman’s car to 
arrive while they’re recording with their phones. Iman reaches 
there and hurriedly gets out of his car. 
Najmeh turns to the kids.
NAJMEH
Don't you get out of the car.
Najmeh gets out of the car as she’s aiming her phone’s camera 
towards the passengers of the other car. As soon as Najmeh gets 
out of the car, Iman suddenly pulls out his gun and shouts and 
orders them to lie down on the ground.
IMAN
Lie down on the ground, come on, quick. Drop your phones and lie 
down on the ground.
Inside the car. 
Rezvan and Sana are shocked by seeing Iman's reaction.
REZVAN
what is Dad doing?
SANA
He still has a gun!
REZVAN
Has he gone crazy? let's take the phone and call Uncle Asad!
From between the two front seats, Sana goes toward the glove box 
to take out the bag of mobile phones. She takes the bag and 
returns to the back seat.
Outside the car.

The woman addresses Sana and Rezvan.
WOMAN
Girls, do you know what your father does? Do you know how many 
requests for death sentences have been issued by him just 
recently? Did you read what they wrote about him?
Sana and Rezvan have conflicting feelings. On one hand, it is a 
shame and on the other, it’s a conflict between their family and 
two strangers.
NAJMEH
Shut up you bitch.
WOMAN
You’re very polite too... whatever I am, I’m definitely better 
than you and people like you who dip your bread in people’s
blood. If you think I’m afraid of your husband’s gun you’re 
mistaken. Right now, I’m sending your image live online so that 
you can be exposed to the whole world.
Rezvan and Sana have noticed that the phones are not working. 
Hearing this threat, Sana screams.

      Iman looks at Rezvan and Sana.
IMAN
I’m telling you for the last time, drop your phones and lie on

Iman's screams and threats are effective enough that the man 
retreats.
MAN
Alright, alright. We’ll do whatever you want. Stop pointing the 
gun at us.
The man puts his phone on the ground. He turns to the woman.
MAN
Drop the phone.
Surprised by the man's reaction, the woman continues filming.
MAN
Ensi Please, don't you see that he is armed? he is swearing to 
God that he is going to shoot. This guy will shoot! drop the 
phone.
Desperate, the woman throws the phone on the ground with 
reluctance and anger.

The man takes out his wallet from his pocket and drops the ID 
card along with the wallet.

The man and the woman do whatever Iman says. Iman looks at 
Najmeh. Najmeh unties the shawl around the woman's neck and cuts 
it in two pieces, in order to tie their hands and feet. Seeing 
how they’re treating the man and the woman, Rezvan gets angry.
REZVAN
They took their mobile phones, they can delete the videos, give 
them back the phones and we can leave.
Suddenly Rezvan's gaze is drawn to the car’s footwell. She sees 
the gun.
REZVAN
Sana?
SANA
Yes, my dear?
Sana notices the direction of Rezvan's gaze. She looks at the 
footwell and sees the gun. She looks at Rezvan.
REZVAN
What is this? It was you?
Sana nods in approval.
REZVAN
Give it to me. 
SANA
Let me keep it myself.
REZVAN
I told you to give it to me.
Sana gives the gun to Rezvan. Rezvan hurriedly and cautiously 
puts it in the pocket of the front seat cover.

Najmeh finishes binding the hands and feet of the man and the 
woman. They are lying face down on the ground. Iman takes their 
mobile phones and gives them to Rezvan.
IMAN
Turn them off. And remove their SIM cards.
Rezvan starts doing as she’s been told. Iman goes toward the 
car. He picks up the car keys and comes near the man. He sits 
next to him. In front of the man's eyes, he throws the keys away 
with all his might. then he gets close to the man's ear.
IMAN
Find the keys before it gets dark because there are many wolves 
out here. Thank God that I let you live, out of respect for my 
wife and children. I hope it will be a lesson and you will not 
make such mistakes again.
Iman's car leaves the scene.

remain in the pocket of the seat cover of the car.
Rezvan, Sana, and Najmeh follow Iman through the dry trees to 
the mansion at the end of the orchard.
With a set of keys, Iman opens the mansion’s entrance door. An 
old house that seems to have been abandoned for a long time.
Sana and Rezvan are cleaning the house.
Iman and Najmeh shake a blanket and prepare it so it can be 
used.
Out of a stool, a wire with a lamp attached to it, and a velvet 
quilt, Iman makes a Korsi (a type of low table with a heater 
underneath and blankets thrown over it).
62. INT. HOUSE’S LIVING ROOM- NIGHT
Iman Najmeh, Rezvan, and Sana are sitting around the Korsi. 
Rezvan and Sana are holding a video camera and, on its screen,
they’re watching old videos of a family picnic by the sea. In 
this video, Iman is filming family members with the same camera. 
Sana also is filming Iman with her phone. They seem happy. 
Rezvan and Sana are staring at these nostalgic images.
Iman has a prayer book in his hand and is reading. Najmeh looks 
at Iman.
NAJMEH
Why didn't you say that the gun was found?
Iman answers without taking his eyes off the book.
IMAN
It’s not. This one was lent to me by Qaderi. He has two.
Najmeh sighs.
NAJMEH
I was happy, I thought this nightmare was over.

      This last sentence attracts Iman’s attention. He takes his eyes

Iman gets up from around the Korsi.
63. EXT. MANSION TO ORCHARD’S ENTRANCE AND POWER BOX- NIGHT
The light of the full moon shines on the orchard. Iman comes out 
of the mansion. The wind is blowing. Iman walks the length of

In the house, Iman is preparing the breakfast table alone. Now 
and then he takes out something from the picnic basket.
He pours some water from a bottle of mineral water into a 
teapot. Steam rises from the kettle on the stove. Iman pours 
boiling water from the kettle into the teapot. Najmeh, Iman, 
Rezvan, and Sana are sitting around the breakfast table.
NAJMEH
Wow, thank you! what a breakfast!
SANA
Dad, when will you give us our phones? We’re so bored here.
IMAN
Don't rush, dear. I'll give you back your phones soon.
Rezvan is silent. As if she is still upset. Iman tries to talk
to her. He puts a cup of tea in front of her.

      IMAN
Don't let your tea get cold, my dear.
REZVAN
Thank you.
SANA
Dad, can we see your family album on this trip?
IMAN
Family album! During our childhood, we had to go to the city to 
take pictures. It wasn't like now; everyone had a phone in their 
hands and could take a picture at any moment and quickly send it 
to this and that. Taking pictures had its own principle. Having 
an album was quite fancy.
SANA
Does that mean you don't have any photos of your parents and
siblings, or your childhood?
IMAN
No, I have one.
SANA
where is it?
IMAN
It should be here, I will find it and show it to you. I was five 
years old. After a few years of planning and saving money, 
Grandpa took us to the city in Karbalaei Suleiman’s van. 
Grandma, Aunt Zahra, Uncle Ali, and me. From there we went by 
train to Mashhad to visit Imam Reza’s shrine. We definitely had 
to take pictures there. Because when we came back, everyone from 
the village would come to our house, and in short, it was very 
important for them to see our photo in the shrine of Imam Reza. 
On the other hand, photography was not allowed in Imam Reza's 
shrine. But some photographers had a large painting of the 
shrine, in front of which the pilgrims would stand and take 
pictures. We also went to one of these photo shoots and stood 
like this and took a photo.

      Iman puts his hand on his heart. Sana jokingly mimics his 
gesture.
SANA
What does that mean?
IMAN
It means surrender. It means devotion. Unquestioning faith and 
obedience.
Sana looks at her father. Rezvan also looks at him, discreetly.
SANA
Is that what you want from us?
IMAN
I don't want it for myself, I want it for God.
SANA
Well, what do you have to do with the relationship between me 
and God?
NAJMEH
Sana!!!
SANA
We are talking, mom.
NAJMEH
What kind of conversation is this?
SANA
I am asking a question.
NAJMEH
Faith means not questioning everything.

      IMAN
Faith of heart. Peace is the result of the faith of heart, but
oh the day when one loses faith in the heart… This is what 
happened to me recently.
Iman’s words and the shift in his tone change the tone of the 
conversation as well.
IMAN
It’s terrible for a person to lose trust and 
faith of heart in his family members. He feels 
that every moment he is being humiliated by 
hearing a lie.
Finding a weapon is no longer a priority for me. 
I want to find the liar. Every day, our family 
is being threatened by lies and secrecy.
No one knows how to react to Iman's strange behavior.
IMAN
Among the four of us, at least one is a liar. 
This person is destroying the trust between 
family members and is destroying the family with 
lies and secrecy.
Najmeh is frightened by Iman’s change of tone. Rezvan pulls 
herself together. Sana listens to Iman's words without the 
slightest reaction.
IMAN
What is clear is that I am not a liar.
So, it’s someone among you. Assuming the gun 
thief didn't tell anyone else that she did it, 
we only have one liar. But my work experience 
says that in reality there may be up to three 
liars in this group.
No one wants to say something against Iman’s words.
IMAN
I'm tired. I’m angry. I am sad. And I want to leave it up to you 
to find out which one of you has the gun.
The silence caused by Iman's terrifying tone continues.

      IMAN
You have one hour to talk and convince the liar to admit her
mistake. I promise there will be no punishment, but the liar 
must make up for what happened. You have one hour!
Iman locks the entrance of the mansion from outside and leaves 
Rezvan, Sana, and Najmeh alone.
REZVAN
What an articulated speech!
Najmeh is absolutely disheartened.
NAJMEH
It shouldn't have come to this.
SANA
I hate his behavior.
REZVAN
Why didn't we tell him that the first liar was you who hid your 
job from your family for all these years?
NAJMEH
It’s too late. I know your father. Whoever did this, this is the 
end of this game, you have to stop.
REZVAN
Mom, how can we be sure you didn’t do it?
NAJMEH
You don't seem to understand what is happening.
I'm begging you, for God’s sake, if you know 
where this damn gun is, stop this game. Just give 
it to me. I’ll say I'm the thief, I'm the liar.
Rezvan uses this opportunity and points to Sana not to trust 
these words in any way.
SANA
Your mistake is that you never stood up to him.

      NAJMEH
All my life, I have tried hard so that you never see this side
of your father.
From the window, we see Iman walking in the orchard outside the 
mansion.
NAJMEH
Do you want to say which one of you has the gun?
REZVAN
We don’t know anything.
Najmeh looks at Sana, but she doesn't get an answer. She then
turns to Rezvan, and Rezvan has nothing more to say either.
NAJMEH
Is this your final answer?
Najmeh faces the girls’ silence. After a pause, she goes to the 
window. She draws Iman's attention to herself by knocking on the 
window glass a few times. Iman looks at Najmeh and comes toward
the mansion. 
Iman opens the door and enters.
IMAN
Well, it’s great that you came to a conclusion this fast.
NAJMEH
It was me... I have the gun.
Iman shows his surprise.
IMAN
Ah... So, it was you? It’s hard to believe... are you 
sacrificing yourself for them? Are you taking the blame for one 
of the girls? Does that mean more lies on top of lies, again?
Najmeh shouts.

      NAJMEH
I’m not lying. I hated that gun from the first night you brought 
it home, you were excited, but I was scared.
Iman looks at Najmeh and the girls for a few moments. First, he 
goes to the front door calmly and locks the door. After that, he 
goes to the window and picks up the video camera in silence. He 
then mounts it on the tripod in front of Najmeh, closes the 
frame, and starts recording the image.
IMAN
So I lived with a liar for twenty years! What other lies have 
you told me?
The sound of Najmeh's breathing can be heard. She stays silent 
for a while and doesn’t know what to say.
NAJMEH
I did not lie to you.
Iman shouts.
IMAN
So what game is this?
Najmeh speaks with a lump in her throat.
NAJMEH
Calm down, my dear.
Iman continues sternly.
IMAN

NAJMEH
I threw it in the water canal near the house.

scared.
NAJMEH
I'm sorry, I made a mistake, forgive me, let's go back to 
Tehran, I'll show you where I dropped the gun, maybe it can 
still be found.
Rezvan is angry about how Iman is treating her mother.
IMAN
When and how did you steal the gun?
NAJMEH
You were moaning in your sleep in the middle of the night, I 
woke you up and gave you water. Then you went out in the living 
room. I used the opportunity and took the gun.
IMAN
After you took the gun, where did you hide it?
When and how did you throw it into the water canal?
NAJMEH
At the right moment, I put the gun in a plastic bag in the 
freezer, between frozen meats.
Looking at each other, Sana and Rezvan are surprised by Najmeh's 
answer and storytelling. Iman is staring at Najmeh's eyes. 
Najmeh hangs her head.
NAJMEH
When you went to work, I brought the gun, wrapped it in a piece 
of cloth, took it down to the iron bridge over the water canal,
and threw it in.

Let's go back to Tehran. Look at the girls, they’re afraid. I 
will come to whatever court you say, I will admit that I took 
the gun. Don't be afraid, I tell everyone you did whatever you 
could.
Iman tries to control himself. Najmeh burst into tears. She 
starts crying.
IMAN
I am not afraid of anyone.
REZVAN
If you are not afraid of anyone, why do you want a gun?
NAJMEH
My dear, don't say anything. You and Sana shouldn’t get involved 
in this.
REZVAN
We were involved in this from the beginning. Get up Mom, stand 
up.

Against her will, Rezvan sits on the chair in front of the

Rezvan and Iman arrive at the parking spot, near the entrance of 
the orchard. Iman opens the car’s door with the remote. He takes 
out his weapon from behind his back. He prepares it to shoot. 
Rezvan opens the door and sits in the back seat. She puts her
hand in the seat cover pocket. But she can’t find the gun.
Rezvan is desperate.

Rezvan takes out her hand.
REZVAN
I’d put it here, but it is not there anymore.

Sitting by the Korsi, Iman reads the prayer book. The sound of 
knocking on the door and Rezvan's screams that she needs to go 
to the bathroom can be heard. Iman doesn't pay attention to 
Rezvan's request for a long time, but finally gets up and goes 
to the room where Rezvan is imprisoned. He opens the door.
IMAN
When you need something, you knock on the door twice and I will 
come to in a few minutes. From now on, if you knock hard on the 
door and shout, I will not come. Get out.
Rezvan comes out of the room furious and enraged. Rezvan walks

Iman enters the mansion. He notices that the tablecloth over the 
broken window is undone. Suddenly he remembers something. He

Sana's phone is missing. Iman immediately takes his phone and 
dials Sana's number. The phone is on, but Sana does not answer.

The orchard.
The light of the full moon shines on the orchard. After settling 
in a proper place, Sana takes out her phone and struggles to 
find a spot in which she has Internet access. She ignores the 
messages that have been sent to her in the past two days and 
starts searching online. In her search, she manages to find the 
model of the gun. By watching a video, she learns how to work 
with it. Afterward, quietly, and cautiously, she approaches the 
mansion.
Near the mansion.
Sana observes the mansion for a while. She approaches the window
and carefully tries to see inside the house. Sitting around the 
Korsi, Iman is reading the prayer book. Sana starts walking
toward the orchard’s shed among the trees. After a while, she 
reaches the shed which is on the other side of the orchard.

Sana quietly opens the door by untying a piece of wire that has 
been used instead of a lock and enters. In the dusty storage, 
next to the gardening tools, there is some mourning equipment, 
such as Alam, Kottal, a cauldron, and some clothes. In a box, 
there are several photo frames, including an old family photo in 
Imam Reza’s shrine which draws Sana's attention. Sana looks at 
the picture for a moment. She stares at his father, who is a 
five-year-old child with his hand on his chest. She puts the 
frame aside and continues to check the rest of the items in the 
shed. She sees a record player and some old cassette tapes 
wrapped in a plastic bag, looking perfectly intact. she tries 
one or two cassettes in the audio player; they are Noha and 
religious speeches. She suddenly notices a microphone and 
several speakers. A dusty old amplifier with several large 
speakers, lots of wires, and an old record player gives her the 
spark of an idea. With curiosity and the help of online 
searches, Sana learns how to use them. In a box, she collects 
some tools that she thinks she needs to break the rooms’ locks. 
Then she returns to the mansion with due caution.
near the mansion.
Sana hides the box of tools she collected somewhere near the 
mansion’s door. She looks inside through a hidden window. Iman 
has put the book aside and is getting ready to sleep. Sana 
watches him for a while to make sure he is sleeping.
The shed.
Sana returns to the shed. Around midnight, she secretly brings 
out the speakers from the shed and places them in different 
spots among the trees facing the mansion. With the necessary 
wirings, she connects the speakers to the amplifier in the shed. 
she connects the microphone. While playing a video of his father 
that she has on the memory of her phone (the picnic by the sea 
that we have already seen on the video camera), she places the 
phone in front of the microphone. The sound of this video, which 
is Iman's affectionate conversation with Sana and Rezvan, 
spreads throughout the orchard.

      73. INT./EXT. MANSION. ORCHARD. THE SHED- NIGHT
Mansion.
Iman is surprised to hear his own voice from speakers in the 
orchard. He dwells on it for a while. Then he hurriedly opens
the door of the mansion and starts running among the trees.
Orchard.
Iman wants to find out where the voice is coming from. But the 
sound is coming from every corner he turns to. He starts
shouting.
IMAN
Sana...
The shed.
Hearing his shouts, Sana removes the phone and instead, she
plays one of the cassette tapes she found using the old cassette 
player. The sound of Noha echoes in the orchard.
Orchard.
Iman is angry about this game. Seeing the light of the shed, he 
runs towards it.
The shed. 
Sana comes out of the shed and hides in a corner. Iman reaches 
the shed. He immediately enters and turns off the player. Sana 
uses this opportunity to close the shed’s door and inserts a
small iron rod that she prepared in advance into the lock. Iman 
is now trapped in the shed. He bangs angrily on the door.
IMAN
Open the door Sana...open the door!
Sana runs towards the mansion. She counts the seconds while 
running. She then picks up the box she’s hidden in advance and 
takes it with her inside the mansion.
Mansion.
Sana goes toward the room where Rezvan is imprisoned. She takes 
a hammer from the box.

      SANA
I’m here.
NAJMEH
Sana, my darling, are you okay?
SANA
Yes, I’m fine, Mom.
NAJMEH
What are you doing?
SANA
I’m getting you out.
REZVAN
Where is Dad?
SANA
In the tools shed.
Amid the hammer blows, Iman's voice is heard from the speakers.
IMAN
Sana, what are you doing? Come on, open the door, you're making 
everything worse than it was... don't make me angrier... Sana... 
Sana!
Indifferent to Iman's voice, Sana continues to bang on the lock.
SANA
If he can open the door, at best it will take him twenty-three 
seconds to get here.
The lock on the door of Rezvan's room breaks. Rezvan comes out 
and they hug each other. Both go toward their mother's room. 
They try to open the door by using a hammer to break the lock.
REZVAN
Dad's voice stopped.

The iron rod in the lock is moving as Iman bangs on the door and 
now it’s on the verge of coming out of its place.
Mansion.
After a few more knocks, the door of Najmeh's room opens. Najmeh 
comes out and hugs the children. Sana shouts.
SANA
let's go...
Reaching the kitchen, Rezvan looks for the car keys, but it’s 
nowhere to be found.
SANA
Come on, don't waste time, we don't need a car... he’s gonna be 
here any minute now.
Orchard.
Najmeh and the girls go toward the entrance through the
orchard’s trees.
74. EXT. DESERT. ABANDONED VILLAGE- NIGHT
In the open shot under the moonlight, Najmeh, Rezvan, and Sana 
are running in the desert towards the abandoned village. 
Suddenly, two points of light (Iman's car) come toward them from 
the orchard. Near the village, Rezvan notices Iman's car. She 
shouts.
REZVAN
Run in different directions!

      Najmeh, Rezvan, and Sana enter the ruins of the village, each in
a different direction.
After a few moments, Iman's car stops in front of the village 
amidst the dust raised by the tires. He gets out of the car and 
enters the village. Iman is searching for Sana, Rezvan, and 
Najmeh.
Rezvan, Sana, and Najmeh are searching for a shelter to stay out 
of Iman's sight.
75. EXT. ABANDONED VILLAGE- DAWN TO SUNRISE (SUN RISES AND 
LIGHTS UP THE SKY DURING THIS SCENE)
After searching for a while, Iman hears a voice from the roof of 
the room he is in. He quietly climbs up the roof from the worn￾out brick walls and fragile stairs. Najmeh has taken refuge in a 
corner. Iman traps her from behind.
IMAN
Don't move.
Najmeh turns towards Iman.
NAJMEH
I’ll move. what do you want to do? Is there anything left that 
you haven’t done already?
You just didn't shoot...shoot then.
IMAN
Be quiet, don't speak, sit down.
NAJMEH
I’ll speak, we won’t sit.
Najmeh doesn’t sit. She is looking at Iman. Suddenly she shouts.
NAJMEH
He’s here girls.
Iman smacks Najmeh right in the mouth.

      I’m telling you to sit down.
Najmeh wipes her mouth.
NAJMEH
I won’t.
Iman suddenly attacks her and grabs her hair in his fist. Najmeh 
falls on the ground and screams. The sound of Najmeh's screams 
attracts Sana's attention. Sana runs toward the sound. She sees 
this scene from a distance: Iman is pulling Najmeh by the hair
and drags her on the ground. Sana is enraged by seeing this 
scene. She quickly brings herself to a spot to surprise Iman. 
She stands behind a wall and waits. As soon as Iman approaches, 
she comes out of the ambush and points the gun at her father.
SANA
Enough! Stop this.
Iman stops. He pretends to be happy to see Sana.
IMAN
So you finally show up…
SANA
Let her go, get up, Mom.
Najmeh has fallen at Iman's feet.
NAJMEH
For the love of God, let it go, Iman. Don't hurt the children, 
you destroyed everything, but why?
Iman ignores Najmeh's pleas and speaks to Sana in a contemptuous 
tone.
IMAN
can you shoot?
SANA
yes, I know how to.

      IMAN
Where did you learn?
SANA
Don't, Dad, stay right there. Otherwise, I swear I’ll shoot 
you... I'm very angry.
IMAN
Shoot your dad?
SANA
Yes, seeing the things you’ve done, I can shoot you easily.
IMAN
Do it then.
NAJMEH
Sana, dear, your dad is not well. Give him the gun and 
everything will end here.
Sana is staring at Iman. Iman releases Najmeh's hair and little 
by little, approaches Sana very slowly.
SANA
It doesn't end, mom, nothing’s going to end. Everything has been 
like this ever since I can remember. You’ve always surrendered
and gave him whatever he wanted.
It's the same now, even if he takes the gun, it won't end.
Iman continues to gradually approach Sana. Sana is staring at
him in the eyes. None of them realize that the roof surface is 
fragile and unreliable. Sana shouts.
SANA
Dad, I swear to God, I’ll shoot you, don't...
Iman comes forward. Sana goes back. Rezvan arrives right from 
behind Iman. She sits on the floor next to Najmeh. Sana shouts.
SANA
Rezvan, tell him to stop.

      Iman doesn’t pay attention.
REZVAN
Sana, let him go, let’s leave.
Suddenly, taking advantage of the opportunity, Iman charges
toward Sana to surprise her. Sana pulls the trigger with a 
spontaneous scream. The bullet hits the fragile roof, and it
collapses. Iman is thrown from the roof to the lower floor on a 
pile of dirt. A cloud of heavy dust rises. The weakness of the 
building causes more debris to fall on top of each other. Najmeh
is shouting.Among the rubbles, the gun can be seen in Iman's 
hand.
The image cuts to documentary videos (recorded with mobile 
phones), showing scenes of protests and the shout of brave 
young women, evoking resistance and hope for freedom.
