OVER BLACK...the CRACK, WHISTLE and POP of FIREWORKS. The
rhythm intensifies, almost violent. Suddenly, fiery flowers
of RED, WHITE and BLUE illuminate the night sky. We are...
EXT. OPEN FIELD - NIGHT1 1
An ALL-WHITE crowd watches, their necks bent in awe. It’s
the 4th of July and the faithful have gathered to worship.
CHYRON: 1911
CLOSE ON FACES gazing CAMERA RIGHT and lit up by a patriotic
kaleidoscope in the sky. POP! We land on the sweaty face of
YOUNG SUTTER. CRACK!
EXT. SUTTER'S HOUSE - NIGHT2 2
CLOSE ON wide-eyed, 6-YEAR-OLD BOY WILLIE, looking up,
transfixed by the light show. His father, BOY CHARLES, who
is just off-screen, brings his attention back to earth:
BOY CHARLES (O.S.)
Hey. You remember how to whistle?
(off Boy Willie’s nod)
Whistle if you see somebody coming.
INT. SUTTER’S HOUSE - NIGHT3 3
The sounds of the show outside are MUFFLED as CAMERA GLIDES
THROUGH a dark corridor. Shafts of red, white and blue
through windows light the way.
CAMERA FINDS an UPRIGHT PIANO. As we draw closer we see that
every bit of the piano is CARVED with mask-like figures
resembling totems in the manner of African sculpture.
But these faces gaze CAMERA LEFT, in opposition to the white
ones we just saw. These are the ANCESTORS.
FLOORBOARDS CREAK as three BLACK MEN in their 30’s enter in
silhouette. The red, white and blue hits different against
their dark skin. They are BOY CHARLES, YOUNG WINING BOY and
YOUNG DOAKER, brothers born in that order.
Boy Charles moves to the piano driven by obsession. The men
knock off the portraits that sit atop of it.
They unroll a rug and lift the piano onto it then slide it
out of the room.
EXT. SUTTER’S HOUSE - NIGHT4 4
The three brothers struggle to lift the piano into a horse-
drawn wagon as the fireworks arc and explode.
1A.
Later, with the piano loaded, Young Doaker snaps the reins
and the wagon lurches forward. Boy Charles places his hat on
6-year-old Boy Willie’s head. He turns around to see his
father standing still, alone, as the wagon pulls away. They
exchange looks as the land seems to grow around his father -
a final goodbye as the FIREWORKS FINALE begins.
1A.
2.
The fireworks crescendo as Boy Charles watches the wagon
disappear into the darkness.
Boy Charles turns and scans the expanse of land, now fully
illuminated by a continuous flow of red, white and blue. He
is a spec under a canopy of colored light.
INT. BOY CHARLES’ SHACK - NIGHT5 5
Boy Charles peers out his window, vigilant. The coast is
clear. He returns to his meal. Then, the sound of HORSES
and MEN. He looks outside and sees Sutter along with a group
of angry white men with shotguns and torches approaching.
EXT. BOY CHARLES’ SHACK - NIGHT5A 5A
Torches ignite the modest structure.
EXT. FIELD - NIGHT6 6
Boy Charles runs for his life. In the distance, his shack is
ABLAZE. He disappears into the night. Somewhere a TRAIN
WHISTLE BLOWS.
EXT. TRAIN DEPOT - NIGHT7 7
ON a YELLOW BOXCAR as it slowly rolls down the track. Boy
Charles runs to the sliding door, flings it open and hops in.
INT. YELLOW BOXCAR - CONTINUOUS8 8
Boy Charles closes the door, flush with adrenaline. Then he
turns and sees THREE HOBOS sitting in the shadows.
Looks are exchanged as he catches his breath. The train
gathers speed and he relaxes. But then a SCREECH and he
jerks as the train grinds to a halt.
Voices and horses outside. Then we hear the DISTANT KA-CHUNK
and the HEAVY SLIDE of a BOXCAR DOOR OPENING. Then another
and another, each one getting closer.
FIRELIGHT through the slats in the boxcar. KA-CHUNK,
SLIDE...and the DOOR OPENS TO REVEAL Sutter and the men.
Then the door SLIDES SHUT. A long beat of silence. Then
GLASS BREAKING as bottles hit the boxcar.
2.
3.
Boy Charles peers through the slats and recoils when one of
the bottles full of whiskey SMASHES near his face.
More FIRELIGHT as the torches get close. And soon...WHOOSH,
FLAMES grow. Boy Charles tries to escape. But the door is
locked tight.
EXT. YELLOW BOXCAR - SIMULTANEOUS9 9
Sutter’s face glows as he watches the boxcar burn. SCREAMS
from inside. Over the boxcar in flames...
TITLE CARD: THE PIANO LESSON
Follow the smoke up into the sky until the FRAME TURNS BLACK.
EXT. ROAD/INT. TRUCK - DAY10 10
CLOSE ON BOY WILLIE, in his father’s hat, chest heaving and
catching his breath. Black and in his 30’s, he has an
infectious grin and a boyishness that is apt for his name.
He is brash and impulsive, talkative and somewhat crude. And
right now he’s too stubborn to let exhaustion win.
CHYRON: 1936
WIDEN as Boy Willie pushes a beat-up, circa-1930’s pick-up
truck on a stretch of road in Sunflower, Mississippi. CAMERA
GLIDES alongside the truck, past a huge pile of WATERMELONS
stacked high in the pick-up bed.
CAMERA LANDS INSIDE THE TRUCK where LYMON, also Black and in
his 30’s, is behind the wheel. He talks little and then with
a straightforwardness that is often disarming. And as with
most things, he’s unsure if this will work.
The truck starts to roll. Boy Willie WHISTLES and shouts
from outside:
BOY WILLIE (O.S.)
Start it, nigger!
Lymon puts it in gear, tries but the engine just coughs.
Another try and it rumbles to life. Boy Willie runs up to
the passenger door and jumps in. Lymon is shocked it worked.
Boy Willie never had a doubt.
EXT. MISSISSIPPI ROAD - MAGIC HOUR11 11
High and wide. A road snakes through the landscape. CAMERA
FINDS the truck heading towards the horizon.
3.
3A.
EXT. ROAD - NIGHT11A 11A
The truck rumbles past.
INT. TRUCK - SIMULTANEOUS11B 11B
Lymon drives and Boy Willie is slumped in the passenger seat,
sleepy as he rocks to the rhythm of the road. Boy Willie
pulls his hat down over his eyes.
EXT. BOY CHARLES’ SHACK - DAY (FLASHBACK)11C 11C
As Boy Charles, wearing the hat, loosens his fist and lets
dirt pour into 6-year-old Boy Willie’s open palms.
BACK TO:
3A.
4.
INT./EXT. LYMON’S TRUCK / HEINZ FACTORY - PRE-DAWN12 12
The dawn is beginning to announce itself, but there is
something in the air that belongs to the night.
Lymon drives and Boy Willie rides as the truck moves through
the urban expanse of PITTSBURGH obscured by smoke coming from
smokestacks.
The truck rumbles through a busy HEINZ FACTORY at shift
change. Workers unload pallets, people push past the truck,
Lymon is wide-eyed, taking in all the action.
INT. TRUCK/EXT. CHARLES HOUSE - DAWN13 13
Lymon drives and Boy Willie points the house out. The brakes
squeal as they pull up to a two-story row house built on the
precipice of a hill that overlooks the city.
INT. CHARLES HOUSE/PARLOR - DAWN14 14
We hear soft, soulful HUMMING coming from off-screen. The
house is sparsely furnished and dominating the parlor is the
piano. There is a stillness in the room that is a portent, a
gathering, a coming together of something akin to a storm.
Then a LOUD KNOCK AT THE DOOR. The humming STOPS.
BOY WILLIE (O.S.)
Hey, Doaker...Doaker!
(He knocks again)
Hey, Doaker! Hey, Berniece!
Berniece!
Doaker emerges with a revolver in hand.
DOAKER
Who is it?
BOY WILLIE (O.S.)
Open the door, nigger! It’s
me...Boy Willie!
Doaker opens the door and Boy Willie and Lymon enter.
DOAKER
What you doing up here?
BOY WILLIE
I told you, Lymon.
(to Doaker)
Lymon talking about you might be
sleep. This is Lymon. You
remember Lymon Jackson from down
home? This my Uncle Doaker.
4.
5.
DOAKER
What you doing up here? I thought
you was still down in Mississippi.
BOY WILLIE
Me and Lymon selling watermelons.
We got a truck out there. Got a
whole truckload of watermelons. We
brought them up here to sell.
Where’s Berniece?
(calls)
Hey, Berniece!
DOAKER
Berniece up there sleep.
BOY WILLIE
Well, let her get up. Hey,
Berniece!
DOAKER
She got to go to work this morning.
BOY WILLIE
Well, she can get up and say hi.
It’s been three years since I seen
her.(calls)
Hey, Berniece! It’s me...Boy
Willie.
DOAKER
Berniece don’t like all that
hollering now. She got to work.
BOY WILLIE
Me and Lymon been riding two days
in that truck...the least she can
do is get up and say hi.
DOAKER
Where you all get that truck from?
Doaker crosses to the kitchen. Boy Willie and Lymon follow.
BOY WILLIE
It’s Lymon’s. I told him let’s get
a load of watermelons and bring
them up here.
LYMON
Boy Willie say he’s going back, but
I’m gonna stay. See what it’s like
up here.
5.
6.
BOY WILLIE
You gonna carry me down there
first.
LYMON
I told you I ain’t going back down
there and take a chance on that
truck breaking down again. You can
take the train. After we sell them
watermelons you have enough money
you can buy a whole railroad car.
DOAKER
You got all them watermelons
stacked up there no wonder the
truck broke down.
LYMON
It got a hole in the radiator but
it runs pretty good. You have to
pump the brakes sometimes before
they catch. Boy Willie leave his
door open and be ready to jump when
that happens.
BOY WILLIE
Lymon think that’s funny. I told
the nigger I give him ten dollars
to get the brakes fixed. But he
thinks that funny.
LYMON
They don’t need fixing. All you
got to do is pump till they catch.
BERNIECE, wearing a nightgown, enters. Thirty-five years
old, she is still in mourning for her husband after three
years.
BERNIECE
What you doing all that hollering
for?
BOY WILLIE
Hey, Berniece. Doaker said you was
sleep. I said at least you could
get up and say hi.
BERNIECE
It’s five o’clock in the morning
and you come in here with all this
noise. You can’t come like normal
folks. You got to bring all that
noise with you.
6.
7.
BOY WILLIE
Hell, I ain’t done nothing but come
in and say hi. I ain’t got in the
house good. I come eighteen
hundred miles to see my sister I
figure she might want to get up and
say hi. What you got, Doaker?
Where your bottle? Me and Lymon
want a drink.
(to Berniece)
This is Lymon. You remember Lymon
Jackson from down home.
LYMON
How you doing, Berniece. You look
just like I thought you looked.
His eyes linger on her. Boy Willie clocks it.
BERNIECE
Why you all got to come in
hollering and carrying on? Waking
the neighbors with all that noise.
BOY WILLIE
They can come over and join the
party. We fixing to have a party.
Doaker, where your bottle? Me and
Lymon celebrating. The Ghosts of
the Yellow Dog got Sutter.
BERNIECE
Say what?
BOY WILLIE
Ask Lymon, they found him the next
morning. Say he drowned in his
well.
DOAKER
When this happen, Boy Willie?
BOY WILLIE
About three weeks ago. Me and
Lymon was over in Stoner County
when we heard about it. We
laughed. We thought it was funny.
A great big old three-hundred-and-
forty-pound man gonna fall down his
well.
LYMON
It remind me of Humpty Dumpty.
7.
(MORE)
8.
BOY WILLIE
Everybody say the Ghosts of the
Yellow Dog pushed him.
BERNIECE
I don’t want to hear that nonsense.
Somebody down there pushing them
people in their wells.
DOAKER
What was you and Lymon doing over
in Stoner County?
BOY WILLIE
We was down there working. Lymon
got some people down there.
LYMON
My cousin got some land down there.
We was helping him.
BOY WILLIE
Got near about a hundred acres. He
got it set up real nice.
(to Berniece)
Me and Lymon got a truckload of
watermelons out there.
BERNIECE
Where you all get that truck from?
BOY WILLIE
I told you it’s Lymon’s. Doaker,
where your bottle? I know you got
a bottle stuck up in your room.
Come on, me and Lymon want a drink.
Doaker exits into his room.
BERNIECE
Where you get that truck from,
Lymon?
LYMON
I bought it.
BERNIECE
Where he get that truck from, Boy
Willie?
BOY WILLIE
He told you he bought it. Bought it
for a hundred and twenty dollars.
(MORE)
8.
BOY WILLIE (CONT'D)
9.
I can’t say where he got that
hundred and twenty dollars from...
(to Lymon)
Where you get that hundred and
twenty dollars from, nigger?
LYMON
I got it like you get yours. I
know how to take care of money.
Doaker brings a bottle and sets it on the dining table.
BOY WILLIE
Aw hell, Doaker got some of that
good whiskey. Don’t give Lymon
none of that. He ain’t used to
good whiskey. He liable to get
sick.
LYMON
I done had good whiskey before.
BOY WILLIE
Lymon bought that truck so he have
him a place to sleep. Sheriff
looking for him. Got Stovall
looking for him too. He down there
sleeping in that truck ducking and
dodging both of them. I told him
come on let’s go up and see my
sister.
BERNIECE
What the sheriff looking for you
for, Lymon?
BOY WILLIE
The man don’t want you to know all
his business. He’s my company. He
ain’t asking you no questions.
LYMON
It wasn’t nothing. It was just a
misunderstanding.
BERNIECE
He in my house. You say the
sheriff looking for him, I wanna
know what he looking for him for.
Otherwise you all can go back out
there and be where nobody don’t
have to ask you nothing.
BOY WILLIE (CONT'D)
9.
10.
LYMON
It was just a misunderstanding.
Sometimes me and the sheriff we
don’t think alike. So we just got
crossed on each other.
BERNIECE
Might be looking for him about that
truck. He might have stole that
truck.
BOY WILLIE
We ain’t stole no truck, woman. I
told you Lymon bought it.
DOAKER
Boy Willie and Lymon got more sense
than to ride all the way up here in
a stolen truck with a load of
watermelons. Now they might have
stole them watermelons, but I don’t
believe they stole that truck.
BOY WILLIE
You don’t even know the man good
and you calling him a thief. And
we ain’t stole them watermelons
either. Them old man Pibterford’s
watermelons. He gave me and Lymon
all we could load for ten dollars.
DOAKER
No wonder you got them stacked up
out there. You must have five
hundred watermelons stacked up out
there.
BERNIECE
Boy Willie, when you and Lymon
planning on going back?
BOY WILLIE
Lymon say he staying. As soon as
we sell them watermelons I’m going
back.
BERNIECE
(exiting up the stairs)
That’s what you need to do. And
you need to do it quick. Come in
here disrupting the house. I don’t
want all that loud carrying on
around here. I’m surprised you
ain’t woke Maretha up.
10.
(MORE)
11.
BOY WILLIE
I was fixing to get her now.
(calls)
Hey, Maretha! Maretha!
BERNIECE
Don’t you wake that child up!
BOY WILLIE
You going up there...wake her up
and tell her her uncle’s here. I
ain’t seen her in three years.
BERNIECE
I ain’t waking that child up...and
don’t you be making all that noise.
You and Lymon need to sell them
watermelons and go on back.
STAY WITH Berniece as she exits up the stairs and moves to...
INT. CHARLES HOUSE/BERNIECE'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS15 15
Where her 11-year-old daughter, MARETHA, sleeps. Berniece
closes the door quietly and stares at the child as she
mindlessly fiddles with the golden crucifix hanging from her
neck.
INT. CHARLES HOUSE/KITCHEN/PARLOR - DAWN16 16
Boy Willie and Lymon drink. Doaker returns his shaving blade
and bowl to his bedroom.
BOY WILLIE
I see Berniece still try to be
stuck up.
DOAKER
Berniece alright. She don’t want
you making all that noise. Maretha
up there sleep.
BOY WILLIE
I ain’t thinking about Berniece.
You hear from Wining Boy? You know
Cleotha died?
DOAKER
Yeah, I heard that. He come by
here about a year ago. Had a whole
sack of money. He stayed here

11.
DOAKER (CONT'D)
(MORE)
12.
Berniece asked him for three
dollars to buy some food and he got
mad and left.
Doaker sits at the dining table with Boy Willie and Lymon.
LYMON
Who’s Wining Boy?
BOY WILLIE
That’s my uncle. That’s Doaker’s
brother. He play piano. He done
made some records and everything.
He still doing that, Doaker?
DOAKER
He made one or two records a long
time ago. If you let him tell it

LYMON

Boy Willie and Lymon cross to the piano.
BOY WILLIE
Yeah...look here, Lymon. See how

See, that’s what I was talking
about. See how it’s carved up real
nice and polished and everything?
You never find you another piano
like that.
LYMON
Yeah, that look real nice.
BOY WILLIE
I told you. My mama used to polish
it every day. See all them
pictures carved on it? That’s what
I was talking about. You can get a
nice price for that piano.
LYMON
That’s all Boy Willie talked about
the whole trip up here. I got
tired of hearing him talk about the
piano.
BOY WILLIE
All you want to talk about is
women. You ought to hear this

watermelons and get me another
part. Get Berniece to sell that
piano and I’ll have the third part.
DOAKER
Berniece ain’t gonna sell that
piano.
BOY WILLIE
I’m gonna talk to her. When she
see I got a chance to get Sutter’s
land she’ll come around.
DOAKER
You can put that thought out your
mind. Berniece ain’t gonna sell
that piano.
BOY WILLIE
I’m gonna talk to her. She been

DOAKER
You know she won’t touch that
piano. I ain’t never known her to
touch it since Mama Ola died. She
say it got blood on it. She got
Maretha playing on it though. Say
Maretha can go on and do everything
she can’t do. Got her in an extra
school down at the Irene Kaufman

14.
BOY WILLIE
Maretha don’t need to be playing on
no piano. She can play on the
guitar.
DOAKER
How much land Sutter got left?
BOY WILLIE
Got a hundred acres. Good land.
He done sold it piece by piece, he
kept the good part for himself.
Now he got to give that up. His
brother come down from Chicago, he
anxious to sell the land, Doaker.
He don’t want to be bothered with
it. He called me to him and said
‘cause of how long our families
done known each other and how we
been good friends and all, say he
wanted to sell the land to me. Say
he’d rather see me with it than Jim
Stovall. Told me he’d let me have
it for two thousand dollars cash
money. He don’t know I found out
the most Stovall would give him for
it was fifteen hundred dollars. He

Sell them watermelons. Get
Berniece to sell that piano. Put

Lay my money down on the table.
Get my deed and walk on out. This

Boy Willie comes back to the dining table.
BOY WILLIE

DOAKER

instruments. He’d buy anything.

of it as she does.
Boy Willie looks at the piano like chattel.
INT. CHARLES HOUSE/BERNIECE'S BEDROOM - DAY17 17
Berniece, now dressed for the day, puts her nightgown into a
basket. Then she straightens up and gathers other pieces of
clothing and puts those in the basket.
Maretha stirs as Berniece quietly exits into the dark,
windowless HALLWAY and closes the door behind her. She moves
to the BATHROOM, grabs some towels and adds them to the
basket.
Then, when she heads back into the hallway, she steps in
something WET -- a small, footprint-shaped puddle. Then she
reacts to a whisper:
SUTTER (O.S.)
Boy Willie...
Her eyes turn to the sound and follow wet footprints down the
hallway...where they end at the SHADOW OF A LARGE MAN with
his HAND ON TOP OF HIS HEAD.
Berniece wonders if her eyes are deceiving her. Then she
moves to the switch and TURNS THE LIGHTS ON. And both the
shadow and the footprints disappear.
16.
16A.
She TURNS THE LIGHTS OFF and the SHADOW REAPPEARS. Berniece
drops the basket and takes off, hollering:
16A.
17.
BERNIECE
Doaker!
INT. CHARLES HOUSE/PARLOR - SIMULTANEOUS18 18
Doaker, Boy Willie and Lymon run to the stairs. Berniece
flies downstairs, terrified.
DOAKER
Berniece, what’s the matter? You
alright? What’s the matter?
Berniece tries to catch her breath. She is unable to speak.
DOAKER (CONT'D)
That’s alright. Take your time.
You alright. What’s the matter?
BERNIECE
Sutter...Sutter’s standing up in
the hall.
Boy Willie runs up the stairs.
DOAKER
Hey, Boy Willie?
INT. CHARLES HOUSE/UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - SIMULTANEOUS19 19
Boy Willie flicks on the light switch. Nothing there.
BOY WILLIE
Ain’t nobody up here.
INT. CHARLES HOUSE/PARLOR - SIMULTANEOUS20 20
DOAKER
Boy Willie!
Doaker ushers Berniece to the couch. Boy Willie enters from
the stairs.
BOY WILLIE
Hey, Doaker, what’s wrong with her?
Berniece, what’s wrong?
DOAKER
She say she seen Sutter’s ghost.
BOY WILLIE
She ain’t seen no Sutter.
BERNIECE
He was standing right there.
17.

BOY WILLIE
That’s all in Berniece’s head.
Ain’t nobody up there. Go on up

DOAKER

Berniece talking about what she

BOY WILLIE
She up there dreaming. She ain’t

LYMON
You want a glass of water,

BOY WILLIE
She don’t need no water. She ain’t

DOAKER

BOY WILLIE
I ain’t stopping her from telling
it.
DOAKER
What happened, Berniece?
BERNIECE
I come out my room to come back
down here and Sutter was standing
there in the hall.
BOY WILLIE
What he look like?
BERNIECE
He look like Sutter. He look like
he always look.
BOY WILLIE
Sutter couldn’t find his way from
Big Sandy to Little Sandy. How he
gonna find his way all the way up
here to Pittsburgh? Sutter ain’t
never even heard of Pittsburgh.
18.
19.
DOAKER
Go on, Berniece.
BERNIECE
Just standing there with a blue
suit on.
BOY WILLIE
That man ain’t never left Marlin
County when he was living...and
he’s gonna come all the way up here
now that he’s dead?
DOAKER
Let her finish. I want to hear
what she got to say.
BOY WILLIE
I’ll tell you this. If Berniece
had seen him like she think she
seen him she’d still be running.
DOAKER
Go on, Berniece. Don’t pay Boy
Willie no mind.
BERNIECE
He was standing there...had his

he might have thought if he took
his hand down his head might have
fallen off.
LYMON
Did he have on a hat?
BERNIECE
Just had on that blue suit...he
just stood there looking at
me...calling Boy Willie’s name.
BOY WILLIE
What he calling my name for?
BERNIECE

well.
BOY WILLIE

You telling me I’m gonna go out

EXT. SUTTER'S WELL - DAY (FLASHBACK)21 21
CAMERA snakes through tall grass then FINDS Sutter, alive and
well, wearing overalls and a straw hat while he ladles water
into his mouth and over his head. A pair of hound-dogs
lounge nearby.
BOY WILLIE (V.O.)
...and things he got around
there...I’m gonna hide and wait
till I catch him looking down his

BERNIECE
Well, what he calling your name

BOY WILLIE
He bending over looking down his
well, woman...how he know who
pushed him? It could have been
anybody. Where was you when Sutter
fell in his well? Where was
Doaker? Me and Lymon was over in
Stoner County. Tell her, Lymon.
The Ghosts of the Yellow Dog got
Sutter. That’s what happened to
him.
BERNIECE
You can talk all that Ghosts of the
Yellow Dog stuff if you want. I

LYMON
The Ghosts of the Yellow Dog pushed

INT. CHARLES HOUSE/PARLOR - DAY25 25
BOY WILLIE
Come talking about he looking for
me. What he come all the way up

he got to do is wait. He could
have saved himself a trip if he
looking for me. That ain’t nothing
but in Berniece’s head. Ain’t no
telling what she liable to come up
with next.
Berniece stands up to confront Boy Willie.
BERNIECE
Boy Willie, I want you and Lymon to
go ahead and leave my house. Just
go on somewhere. You don’t do
nothing but bring trouble with you
everywhere you go. If it wasn’t
for you Crawley would still be
alive.
BOY WILLIE
Crawley what? I ain’t had nothing
to do with Crawley getting killed.
Crawley three time seven. He had
his own mind.
BERNIECE
Just go on and leave. Let Sutter
go somewhere else looking for you.
BOY WILLIE
I’m leaving. Soon as we sell them
watermelons. Other than that I
ain’t going nowhere. Hell, I just
got here. Talking about Sutter
looking for me. Sutter was looking
for that piano. That’s what he was
looking for. He had to die to find
out where that piano was at... If I
was you I’d get rid of it.

BOY WILLIE (CONT'D)
22.
That’s the way to get rid of
Sutter’s ghost. Get rid of that
piano.
BERNIECE
I want you and Lymon to go on and
take all this confusion out of my
house!
BOY WILLIE
Hey tell her, Doaker. What kind of
sense that make? I told you,
Lymon, as soon as Berniece see me
she was gonna start something.
Didn’t I tell you that? Now she
done made up that story about
Sutter just so she could tell me to
leave her house. Well, hell, I
ain’t going nowhere till I sell
them watermelons.
BERNIECE
Well why don’t you go out there and
sell them! Sell them and go on

BOY WILLIE
We waiting till the people get up!
LYMON
Boy Willie say if you get out there
too early and wake the people up
they get mad at you and won’t buy
nothing from you.
DOAKER
You won’t be waiting long. You

This the time everybody be getting

BERNIECE
Come on, Doaker, walk up here with
me. Let me get Maretha up and get

you and Lymon leave my house.
Berniece and Doaker exit up the stairs. Boy Willie calls
after them:
BOY WILLIE (CONT'D)
22.
23.
BOY WILLIE
If you see Sutter up there...tell
him I’m down here waiting on him.
EXT. CHARLES HOUSE/PORCH - DAY26 26
Morning activity on the street. Move past the truck stacked
high with WATERMELONS. Boy Willie and Lymon collect their
bags from the bed of the truck.
LYMON
What if she see him again?
BOY WILLIE
That’s all in her head. There
ain’t no ghost up there.
LYMON
I’m glad he didn’t say he was
looking for me.
BOY WILLIE
I wish I would see Sutter’s ghost
give me a chance to put a whupping
on him.
LYMON
You ought to stay up here with me.
You be down there working his
land...he might come looking for
you all the time.
BOY WILLIE
I ain’t thinking about Sutter. And
I ain’t thinking about staying up
here. You stay up here. I’m going
back and get Sutter’s land. You
think you ain’t got to work up
here. You think this the land of
milk and honey. But I ain’t scared
of work. I’m going back and farm

Show me what you can do. Come on

you a dime...show me what you can
do. Don’t be bashful now. That
dime say you can’t be bashful.
Boy Willie puts the dime on the piano. Maretha plays. It is
something any beginner first learns.
BOY WILLIE (CONT'D)
Here, let me show you something.
Boy Willie sits and plays a simple boogie-woogie.
BOY WILLIE (CONT'D)
See that? See what I’m doing?
That’s what you call the boogie-
woogie. See now...you can get up

Ain’t no need you trying to take
advantage of company.
MARETHA

BOY WILLIE
Uncle Boy Willie gonna get you a

guitar. Your mama told you about

MARETHA
She say it just always been like
that since she got it.
BOY WILLIE
You hear that, Doaker? And you
sitting up here in the house with
Berniece.
DOAKER
I ain’t got nothing to do with
that. I don’t get in the way of
Berniece’s raising her.
BOY WILLIE
You tell your mama to tell you
about that piano. You ask her how
them pictures got on there. If she
don’t tell you I’ll tell you.
BERNIECE (O.S.)
Maretha!
MARETHA
I got to get ready to go.
Boy Willie nods to the dime and Maretha grabs it and exits up

EXT. CHARLES HOUSE - DAY28 28
CLOSE ON A GOLD CRUCIFIX, glinting in the sunlight. WIDEN TO

eight years old, Avery is honest and ambitious. He is

He carries a small Bible.

DOAKER
Hey, Avery, come on in.

expecting to see me.
Avery stands.
AVERY

BOY WILLIE
I remember when you was down there

cotton. You wasn’t thinking about

AVERY
That must be your truck out there.
I saw that truck with them
watermelons, I was trying to figure
out what it was doing in front of
the house.
BOY WILLIE
Yeah, me and Lymon selling
watermelons. That’s Lymon’s truck.
DOAKER

Berniece say you all going down to

AVERY
Got a pension and everything. They

Thanksgiving.
LYMON
How you know the rope ain’t gonna
break? Ain’t you scared the rope’s
gonna break?
AVERY
That’s steel. They got steel
cables hold it up. It take a whole
lot of breaking to break that
steel. Naw, I ain’t worried about
nothing like that. Now, I wouldn’t
get in none of them airplanes. You
couldn’t pay me to do nothing like
that.
LYMON
That be fun. I’d rather do that
than ride in one of them elevators.
BOY WILLIE
How many of them watermelons you
wanna buy?
AVERY
I thought you was gonna give me one
seeing as how you got a whole truck
full.
BOY WILLIE
You can get one, get two. I’ll
give you two for a dollar.
AVERY
I can’t eat but one. How much are
they?
BOY WILLIE
Aw, nigger, you know I’ll give you
a watermelon. Go on, take as many
as you want. Just leave some for
me and Lymon to sell.
AVERY
I don’t want but one.
29.
30.
BOY WILLIE
How you get to be a preacher,
Avery? I might want to be a
preacher one day. Have everybody
call me Reverend Boy Willie.
AVERY
It come to me in a dream. God
called me and told me he wanted me
to be a shepherd for his flock.
That’s what I’m gonna call my
church...The Good Shepherd Church
of God and Christ.
DOAKER
Tell him what you told me. Tell
him about the three hobos.
AVERY
Boy Willie don’t want to hear all
that.
LYMON
I do. Lots of people say your
dreams can come true.
AVERY
Naw. You don’t want to hear all
that.
DOAKER
Go on. I told him you was a
preacher. He didn’t want to
believe me. Tell him about the
three hobos.
AVERY
Well, it come to me in a dream.
See...I was sitting out in this
railroad yard watching the trains
go by. The train stopped and these
three hobos got off.
EXT. TRAIN DEPOT - NIGHT (DREAM SEQUENCE)32 32
Trains cross TO REVEAL Avery, lit by a WHITE HOT SPOTLIGHT
FROM HEAVEN. He is unshaven, haggard and dressed in work
clothes. A train stops and THREE HOBOS get off, the same
hobos who were in the boxcar at the beginning of our story.
AVERY (V.O.)
They told me they had come from
Nazareth. And was on their way to
Jerusalem.
30.
31.
Each of their faces is bathed in WARM GOLDEN LIGHT coming
from the small FLAMES that dance on each of their CANDLES.
AVERY (V.O.)
They had three candles. They gave
me one and told me to light it...
But to be careful that it didn’t go
out.
The hobos encircle Avery and give him an unlit candle.
Another offers flame off of which to light it.
Avery lights his candle and it flickers in the wind. He cups
his hand around it.
EXT. MODEST HOUSE - NIGHT (DREAM SEQUENCE)33 33
Avery stands out front with his candle.
AVERY (V.O.)
Next thing I knew I was standing in
front of this house. Something
told me to go knock on the door.
An OLD BLACK WOMAN answers the door. Though slight, her
presence is so immense it makes Avery shrink.
AVERY (V.O.)
This old woman opened the door and
said they had been waiting on me.
Then she led me to this room.
INT. HALLWAY (DREAM SEQUENCE)34 34
Total darkness except for the orb of golden light from
Avery’s candle as he follows the Old Woman down the hall.
She OPENS A DOOR to DAYLIGHT as they emerge into...
INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY (DREAM SEQUENCE)35 35
SHAFTS OF GOLDEN SUNLIGHT through windows. The room is huge
and does not match the size of the modest house.
Avery moves to a small hole in the wall with a ray of light
shining through it. He crouches down and peers through.
AVERY (V.O.)
It was a big room and it was full
of all kinds of different people.
They looked like anybody else...
Through the hole he sees a congregation, dressed in their
Sunday best, but he can only see from their waist down.
31.
32.
AVERY (V.O.)
...except they all had sheep heads
and was all making noise like sheep
make.
A large sheep’s eye meets him on the other side of the wall.
He now sees that all the bodies have sheep heads.
AVERY (V.O.)
I heard somebody call my name.
WOMAN’S VOICE
Avery...
Avery turns his head, his gaze lands on the HOBOS who no
longer hold candles.
AVERY (V.O.)
I looked around and there was these
same three hobos.
INT. BATHROOM - DAY (DREAM SEQUENCE)36 36
Spacious, sterile and white.
AVERY (V.O.)
They washed my feet and combed my
hair.
Water runs off Avery’s feet. A comb pulls through thick
hair.
AVERY (V.O.)
They told me to take off my clothes
and give me a blue robe with gold
thread.
The GOLD THREAD glistens. And we REVEAL Avery, now clean
shaven with a fresh haircut.
AVERY (V.O.)
Then they showed me these three
doors and told me to pick one.
INT. ROOM - DAY (DREAM SEQUENCE)37 37
Avery enters an empty room.
AVERY (V.O.)
I went through one of them doors
and that flame leapt off that
candle and it seemed like my whole
head caught fire.
32.
33.
The flame jumps to Avery’s head and lights it on fire.
BACK TO:
INT. CHARLES HOUSE/PARLOR - DAY38 38
Lymon is rapt. Boy Willie thinks Avery is full of shit. And
Doaker’s already heard it.
AVERY
I looked around and there was four
or five other men standing there
with these same blue robes on.
Then we heard a voice tell us to
look out across this valley. We
looked out and saw the valley was
full of wolves. The voice told us
that these sheep people that I had
seen in the other room had to go
over to the other side of this
valley and somebody had to take
them. Then I heard another voice
say...
INT. ROOM - DAY (DREAM SEQUENCE)39 39
Avery stands in his blue robe. Now surrounded by a herd of
live sheep.
WOMAN’S VOICE
Who shall I send?
AVERY
Here I am. Send me.
AVERY (V.O.)
That’s when I met Jesus.
We don’t see Jesus, but Avery’s face glows brighter as the
son of God approaches.
AVERY (V.O.)
He say “If you go, I’ll go with
you.” Something told me to say,
“Come on. Let’s go.”
BACK TO:
INT. CHARLES HOUSE/PARLOR - DAY40 40
Avery finishes his story for Doaker, Boy Willie and Lymon.
33.
34.
AVERY
That’s when I woke up. My head
still felt like it was on
fire...but I had a peace about
myself that was hard to explain. I
knew right then that I had been
filled with the Holy Ghost and
called to be a servant of the Lord.
It took me a while before I could
accept that.
LYMON
I see why you gonna call it the
Good Shepherd Church. You dreaming
about them sheep people. I can see
that easy.
BOY WILLIE
Doaker say you sent some white man
past the house to look at that
piano. Say he was going around to
all the colored people’s houses
looking to buy up musical
instruments.
AVERY
Yeah, but Berniece didn’t want to
sell that piano. After she told me
about it...I could see why she
didn’t want to sell it.
BOY WILLIE
What’s the man’s name?
AVERY
Oh, that’s a while back now. I
done forgot his name. He gave
Berniece a card with his name and
telephone number on it, but I
believe she throwed it away.
Berniece and Maretha enter from the stairs, dressed for the
day. Lymon looks at Berniece and likes what he sees.
BERNIECE
Maretha, run back upstairs and get
my pocketbook. And wipe that hair
grease off your forehead. Go
ahead, hurry up.
Maretha exits up the stairs. Lymon’s eyes stay on Berniece
as she tolerates a hug from Avery.
34.
35.
BERNIECE (CONT'D)
How you doing, Avery? You done got
all dressed up. You look nice.
Boy Willie, I thought you and Lymon
was going to sell them watermelons.
BOY WILLIE
Lymon done got sleepy. We liable
to get some sleep first.
LYMON
I ain’t sleepy.
DOAKER
As many watermelons as you got
stacked up on that truck out there,
you ought to have been gone.
BOY WILLIE
We gonna go in a minute. We going.
BERNIECE
Doaker. I’m gonna stop down there
on Logan Street. You want
anything?
DOAKER
You can pick up some ham hocks if
you going down there.
Doaker gets up and fishes his wallet out of his side table.
DOAKER (CONT'D)
Don’t get the short ones lessen
they smoked. If you got to get the
fresh ones make sure that they the
long ones. If they ain’t got them
smoked then go ahead and get the
short ones.
Maretha enters from the stairs.
MARETHA
We gonna take the street car?
BERNIECE
Me and Avery gonna drop you off at
the settlement house. You mind
them people down there. Don’t be
going down there showing your
color. Boy Willie, I done told you
what to do. I’ll see you later,
Doaker.
35.
35A.
AVERY
I’ll be seeing you again, Boy
Willie.
35A.
36.
On their way out the door...
BOY WILLIE
Hey, Berniece...what’s the name of
that man Avery sent past say he
want to buy the piano?
BERNIECE
I knew it. I knew it when I first
seen you. I knew you was up to
something.
BOY WILLIE
Sutter’s brother say he selling the
land to me. He waiting on me now.
Told me he’d give me two weeks. I
got one part. Sell them
watermelons get me another part.
Then we can sell that piano and
I’ll have the third part.
BERNIECE
I ain’t selling that piano, Boy
Willie. If that’s why you come up
here you can forget about it.
(to Doaker)
Doaker, I’ll see you later. Boy
Willie ain’t nothing but a whole
lot of mouth. I ain’t paying him
no mind. If he come up here
thinking he gonna sell that piano
then he done come up here for
nothing.
Berniece, Avery and Maretha exit out the front door.
BOY WILLIE
Hey, Lymon! You ready to go sell
these watermelons.
Boy Willie and Lymon start to exit. At the door Boy Willie
turns to Doaker.
BOY WILLIE (CONT'D)
Hey, Doaker...if Berniece don’t
want to sell that piano...I’m gonna
cut it in half and go on and sell
my half.
Boy Willie and Lymon exit. Somewhere a Piano PLAYS a
rendition of “Arkansas” by: Henry Thomas.

EXT. COBBLESTONE STREET / SIDEWALK - DAY41 41
Berniece marches down the sidewalk ahead of Avery. Maretha
lags behind them both.
Berniece turns and grabs Maretha by the wrist, pulling her
forward.
EXT./INT. TRUCK - DAY42 42
MUSIC CONTINUES as Lymon drives and Boy Willie rides. Lymon
hits the brakes but they don’t work. Lymon pumps, still
nothing. Boy Willie opens the passenger door, ready to jump.
LYMON
They ain’t catching...
Lymon keeps pumping but the truck won’t stop. And Boy Willie
dives out.
INT. JUKE JOINT - DAWN43 43
MUSIC CONTINUES. We are CLOSE ON a FOLDED HANDWRITTEN LETTER
shoved into the front pocket of a jacket hanging on a chair.
As CAMERA COMES AROUND we see the room. It’s the after-after
party. A Black man is passed out. Another pours what’s left
in his bottle into a glass.
SCORE BECOMES SOURCE as WAFTING SMOKE takes us to the owner
of the jacket who’s sitting on the chair. And we meet WINING
BOY as he plays the piano and sings the song.
Doaker’s older brother, Wining Boy tries to present the image
of a successful musician and gambler, but his music, his
clothes and even his manner of presentation are old. He is a
man who looking back over his life continues to live it with
an odd mixture of zest and sorrow.
INT. / EXT. CHARLES HOUSE - DUSK43A 43A
Camera glides through the house past Doaker doing chores. We
settle on the front window, finding Wining Boy, now on the
porch.
Doaker enters frame, the two embrace.

So the Ghosts of the Yellow Dog got
Sutter.
DOAKER (V.O.)
Berniece say she seen his ghost.

EXT. CHARLES HOUSE/YARD - NIGHT44 44
Wining Boy nurses a pint bottle as Doaker lends an ear.
WINING BOY
I’ll tell you outright...if I see
Sutter’s ghost I’ll be on the first
thing I find that got wheels on it.
(then)
Other than seeing Sutter’s ghost
how’s she doing?
37A.
(MORE)
38.
DOAKER
She doing alright. She still got
Crawley on her mind. He been dead
three years but she still holding
on to him. She need to go out here
and let one of these fellows grab a
whole handful of whatever she got.
She act like it done got precious.
WINING BOY
They always told me any fish will
bite if you got good bait.
DOAKER
She stuck up on it. She think it’s
better than she is. I believe she
messing around with Avery. They
got something going. He a preacher
now. If you let him tell it the
Holy Ghost sat on his head and
heaven opened up with thunder and
lightning and God was calling his
name. Told him to go out and
preach and tend to his flock.
That’s what he gonna call his
church. The Good Shepherd Church.
WINING BOY
They had that joker down in Spear
walking around talking about he
Jesus Christ. He gonna live the
life of Christ. Went through the
last supper and everything. Rented
him a mule on Palm Sunday and rode
through the town. Did
everything...talking about he
Christ.
EXT. “CALVARY” - DAY45 45
LOW ANGLE looking up at BLACK JESUS hanging on the cross
framed by heavenly clouds. STRINGS SWELL as he takes his
last breath and his head drops. Suddenly the MUSIC STOPS and
we WIDEN as...Black Jesus steps down off a small crate.
BACK TO:
EXT. CHARLES HOUSE/YARD - NIGHT46 46
WINING BOY
He did everything until they got up
to that crucifixion part. Got up
to that part and told everybody to
go home and quit pretending.
(MORE)
38.
WINING BOY (CONT'D)
39.
He got up to the whole crucifixion
part and changed his mind. Had a
whole bunch of folks come down
there to see him get nailed to the
cross. I don’t know who’s the
worse fool. Him or them. Had all
them folks come down there...even
carried the cross up this little
hill. People standing around
waiting to see him get nailed to
the cross and he stop everything
and preach a little sermon and told
everybody to go home. Had the
nerve to tell them to come to
church on Easter Sunday to
celebrate his resurrection.
DOAKER
I’m surprised Avery ain’t thought
about that. He trying every little
thing to get him a congregation
together. They meeting over at his
house till he get him a church.
WINING BOY
Ain’t nothing wrong with being a
preacher. You got the preacher on
one hand and the gambler on the
other. Sometimes there ain’t too
much difference in them.
(finishes his whiskey)
What you got? Give me a little
nip. I know you got something
stuck up in your room.
DOAKER
I ain’t seen you walk in here and
put nothing on the table. You done
sat there and drank up your
whiskey. Now you talking about
what you got.
WINING BOY
I got plenty money. Give me a
little nip.
INT. CHARLES HOUSE/KITCHEN - NIGHT47 47

WINING BOY
You know Cleotha died.
WINING BOY (CONT'D)
39.

DOAKER
Yeah, I heard that last time I was
down there. I was sorry to hear
that.
Wining Boy pulls the letter from his pocket.
WINING BOY
One of her friends wrote and told
me. I got the letter right here.
I was down in Kansas City and she
wrote and told me Cleotha had died.
Name of Willa Bryant. They was
nailing her coffin shut by the time
I heard about it. I never knew she
was sick. I believe it was that
yellow jaundice. That’s what
killed her mama.
DOAKER
Cleotha wasn’t but forty-some.
WINING BOY
She was forty-six. You remember I
used to run around there. Couldn’t
nothing keep me still. Much as I
loved Cleotha I loved to ramble.
Couldn’t nothing keep me still. We
got married and we used to fight
about it all the time. Then one
day she asked me to leave. Told me
she loved me before I left. Told
me, Wining Boy, you got a home as
long as I got mine. And I believe
in my heart I always felt that and
that kept me safe.
DOAKER
Cleotha always did have a nice way
about her.
WINING BOY
Man, that woman was something. I
used to thank the Lord. Many a
night I sat up and looked out over
my life. Said, well, I had
Cleotha. When it didn’t look like
there was nothing else for me, I
said, thank God, at least I had
that. If I ever go anywhere in
this life I done known a good
woman. And that used to hold me
till the next morning.
40.
41.
Wining Boy downs his whiskey. Then the front door opens and
Boy Willie and Lymon enter.
BOY WILLIE
Aw hell...look here! We was just
talking about you. Doaker say you
left out of here with a whole sack
of money. I told him we wasn’t
going see you till you got broke.
WINING BOY
What you mean broke? I got a whole
pocketful of money.
BOY WILLIE
Doaker say Berniece asked you for
three dollars and you got mad and
left.
WINING BOY
Berniece try and rule over you too
much for me. That’s why I left.
It wasn’t about no three dollars.
DOAKER
Did you all get that truck fixed?
BOY WILLIE
We got it running and got halfway
out there on Centre and it broke
down again. Lymon went out there
and messed it up some more. Fellow
told us we got to wait till
tomorrow to get it fixed. Say he
have it running like new. Lymon
going back down there and sleep in
the truck so people don’t take the
watermelons.
LYMON
Lymon nothing. You go down there
and sleep in it. I ain’t sleeping
in no truck.
BOY WILLIE
They can take all the watermelons.
I don’t care. Wining Boy where you

WINING BOY

BOY WILLIE
I ain’t got no money. I’m trying

Sutter? The Ghosts of the Yellow
Dog got him about three weeks ago.
Berniece done seen his ghost and

WINING BOY
How many that make the Ghosts of
the Yellow Dog done got?
BOY WILLIE
Must be about nine or ten, eleven
or twelve. I don’t know. Berniece
say she don’t believe all that
about the Ghosts of the Yellow Dog.
WINING BOY
She ain’t got to believe. You go
ask them white folks in Sunflower
County if they believe. You go ask
Sutter if he believe. I don’t care
if Berniece believe or not. I done
been to where the Southern cross
the Yellow Dog and called out their
names. They talk back to you, too.
LYMON
What they sound like? The wind or

BOY WILLIE
You done been there for real,

EXT. TRAIN CROSSING - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)48 48
Train tracks and the crunch of gravel underfoot takes us to
Wining Boy, drunk and weaving.
WINING BOY (V.O.)
It didn’t look like nothing was
going right in my life. I said
everything can’t go wrong all the
time...let me go down there and
call on the Ghosts of the Yellow
Dog, see if they can help me.
He finishes his whiskey and throws the bottle.
WINING BOY (V.O.)
I went down there and right there
where them two railroads cross each
other...I stood right there on that
spot and called out their names.
Wining Boy stands at the intersection of two railroad tracks.
He shouts their names but we don’t hear it.
BACK TO:

WINING BOY
They talk back to you, too.
LYMON
People say you can ask them
questions. They talk to you like
that?
WINING BOY
A lot of things you got to find out
on your own. I can’t say how they
talk to nobody else. But to me it
just filled me up in a strange sort
of way to be standing there on that
spot.
EXT. TRAIN CROSSING - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)50 50
Wining Boy stands on the tracks.

WINING BOY (V.O.)

like the longer I stood there the
bigger I got.
Then the tracks rumble beneath Wining Boy’s feet.
WINING BOY (V.O.)
I seen the train coming and it seem
like I was bigger than the train.
The light from an oncoming train rapidly grows. Wining Boy
holds his ground.
WINING BOY (V.O.)
I started not to move. But
something told me to go ahead and
get on out the way.
BACK TO:
INT. CHARLES HOUSE/KITCHEN/PARLOR - NIGHT51 51
WINING BOY
The train passed and I started to
go back up there and stand some
more. But something told me not to
do it. I walked away from there
feeling like a king. Went on and
had a stroke of luck that run on
for three years. So I don’t care
if Berniece believe or not.
Berniece ain’t got to believe. I
know ‘cause I been there. Now
Doaker’ll tell you about the Ghosts
of the Yellow Dog.
DOAKER
I don’t try and talk that stuff
with Berniece. Avery got her all
tied up in that church. She just
think it’s a whole lot of nonsense.
BOY WILLIE
Berniece don’t believe in nothing.
She just think she believe. She
believe in anything if it’s
convenient for her to believe. But
when that convenience run out then
she ain’t got nothing to stand on.
44.
45.
WINING BOY
Let’s not get on Berniece now.
Doaker tell me you talking about
selling that piano.
BOY WILLIE
Yeah...hey Doaker, I got the name

I’m gonna take and sell that piano
and get the third part.
DOAKER
That land ain’t worth nothing no
more. The smart white man’s up
here in these cities. He cut the
land loose and step back and watch
you and the dumb white man argue
over it.
BOY WILLIE
(after a beat)
Hey Doaker...give me a drink. I
see Wining Boy got his glass.
Doaker exits the room.
BOY WILLIE (CONT'D)
Wining Boy what you doing in Kansas
City? What they got down there?
LYMON
I hear they got some nice-looking
women in Kansas City. I sure like
to go down there and find out.
WINING BOY
Man, the women down there is
something else.
Doaker enters with a bottle of whiskey. He sets it on the
table with some glasses.
DOAKER
You wanna sit up here and drink up
my whiskey, leave a dollar on the
table when you get up.

BOY WILLIE
You ain’t doing nothing but showing
your hospitality. I know we ain’t
got to pay for your hospitality.
WINING BOY
Doaker say they had you and Lymon

on my old stomping grounds.
BOY WILLIE
Me and Lymon was down there hauling

drive off.
EXT. WOODS - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)53 53
The headlights from Jim Miller’s truck illuminate Boy Willie,
Lymon and Crawley as they load freshly chopped wood into the
truck in the RAIN.
Then Lymon reacts to the distant sound of an engine
approaching. The HEADLIGHTS of TWO TRUCKS flick on. The men
squint against the brightness. They’re surrounded.
Then a group of white men emerge from the trucks. They all
have guns.

LYMON
They ambushed us right there. Me

BOY WILLIE
They looking for Lymon down there

LYMON
Fined me a hundred dollars. Mr.
Stovall come and paid my hundred
dollars and the judge say I got to
work for him to pay him back his
hundred dollars. I told them I’d
rather take my thirty days but they
wouldn’t let me do that.
BOY WILLIE
As soon as Stovall turned his back,
Lymon was gone. He down there
living in that truck dodging the
sheriff and Stovall. So I brought
him up here.
LYMON
I told Boy Willie I’m gonna stay up
here. I ain’t going back with him.
BOY WILLIE
Ain’t nobody twisting your arm to
make you go back. You can do what
you want to do.
WINING BOY
I’ll go back with you. I’m on my
way down there. You gonna take the
train? I’m gonna take the train.
LYMON
They treat you better up here.
BOY WILLIE
I ain’t worried about nobody
mistreating me. They treat you
like you let them treat you. They
mistreat me I mistreat them right
back. Ain’t no difference in me
and the white man.
WINING BOY
Ain’t no difference as far as how
somebody supposed to treat you. I
agree with that. But I’ll tell you
the difference between the colored
man and the white man. The colored
man can’t fix nothing with the law.
BOY WILLIE
I don’t go by what the law say.
The law’s liable to say anything.
I go by if it’s right or not. I
take and look at it for myself.
47.

LYMON
That’s why you gonna end up back
down there on the Parchman Farm.
BOY WILLIE
I ain’t thinking about no Parchman
Farm. You liable to go back before
me.
LYMON
They work you too hard down there.
All that weeding and hoeing and
chopping down trees. I didn’t like
all that.
WINING BOY
You ain’t got to like your job on
Parchman. Hey, tell him, Doaker,
the only one got to like his job is
the water boy.
DOAKER
If he don’t like his job he need to
set that bucket down.
BOY WILLIE
That’s what they told Lymon. They

Hey, Doaker, they still talk about

“You Doaker Boy’s nephew?” I say,
“Yeah, me and him is family.” They

DOAKER
I don’t never want to see none of

BOY WILLIE
I don’t want to see them either.
(beat)
Hey, Wining Boy, come on play some
piano. You a piano player, play
some piano. Lymon wanna hear you.
WINING BOY
I give that piano up. That was the
best thing that ever happened to
me, getting rid of that piano.
That piano got so big and I’m
carrying it around on my back. I
don’t wish that on nobody. See,
you think it’s all fun being a
recording star. Got to carrying
that piano around and man did I get
slow. Got just like molasses. The
world just slipping by me and I’m
walking around with that piano.
Now, the first three or four years
of that is fun. You can’t get
enough whiskey and you can’t get
enough women and you don’t never
get tired of playing that piano.
But that only last so long. You
look up one day and you hate the
whiskey, and you hate the women,
and you hate the piano. But that’s
all you got. You can’t do nothing
else. All you know how to do is
play that piano. Now, who am I?
Am I me? Or am I the piano player?
Sometime it seem like the only
thing to do is shoot the piano
player ‘cause he the cause of all
the trouble I’m having.
DOAKER
What you gonna do when your
troubles get like mine?

Berniece to sell that piano. Put
them two parts with the part I done
saved...
WINING BOY
Berniece ain’t gonna sell that
piano. I don’t see why you don’t
know that.
BOY WILLIE
What she gonna do with it? She
ain’t doing nothing but letting it
sit up there and rot. That piano
ain’t doing nobody no good.
LYMON
That’s a nice piano. If I had it
I’d sell it. Unless I knew how to
play like Wining Boy. You can get
a nice price for that piano.
DOAKER
Now I’m gonna tell you something,
Lymon don’t know this...but I’m
gonna tell you why me and Wining
Boy say Berniece ain’t gonna sell
that piano.
BOY WILLIE
She ain’t got to sell it! I’m gonna
sell it! Berniece ain’t got no more
rights to that piano than I do.
DOAKER
I’m talking to the man...let me
talk to the man. See, now...to
understand why we say that...to
understand about that piano...you
got to go back to slavery time.
See, our family was owned by a
fellow named Robert Sutter. That
was Sutter’s grandfather. Alright.
The piano was owned by a fellow
named Joel Nolander. He was one of
the Nolander brothers from down in
Georgia. (MORE)

It was coming up on Sutter’s
wedding anniversary and he was
looking to buy his wife...Miss
Ophelia was her name...he was
looking to buy her an anniversary
present. Only thing with him...he
ain’t had no money. But he had some
niggers. So he asked Mr. Nolander
to see if maybe he could trade off
some of his niggers for that piano.
Told him he would give him one and
a half niggers for it. That’s the
way he told him. Say he could have
one full grown and one half grown.
Mr. Nolander agreed only he say he
had to pick them. He didn’t want
Sutter to give him just any old
nigger. He say he wanted to have
the pick of the litter.

grandmother...

But he’s terrified when Nolander stops at MAMA BERNIECE

cook and clean the house and talk
to her and what not. And she
missed having my daddy around the
house to fetch things for her. So
she asked to see if maybe she could
trade back that piano and get her
niggers back. Mr. Nolander said
no. Said a deal was a deal. Him
and Sutter had a big falling out
about it and Miss Ophelia took sick
to the bed. Wouldn’t get out of
the bed in the morning. She just
lay there. The doctor said she was
wasting away.

didn’t ask for all that. But
see...there wasn’t nothing he could
do about it. When Miss Ophelia
seen it...she got excited. Now she
had her piano and her niggers too.
She took back to playing it and
played on it right up to the day
she died. Alright...now see, our *
brother Boy Charles...that’s

three boys. He’s dead now. He
used to talk about that piano all
the time. He never could get it
off his mind. Two or three months
go by and he be talking about it
again. He be talking about taking
it out of Sutter’s house. Say it
was the story of our whole family
and as long as Sutter had it...he
had us. Say we was still in
slavery. Me and Wining Boy tried
to talk him out of it but it
wouldn’t do any good. Soon as he

DOAKER
His daddy decided to stay around
there and wait until Sutter got
home to make it look like business
as usual. Now, I don’t know what
happened when Sutter came home and
found that piano gone. But
somebody went up to Boy Charles’s
house and set it on fire. But he
wasn’t in there. He must have seen
them coming ‘cause he went down and
caught the 3:57 Yellow Dog. He
didn’t know they was gonna come
down and stop the train. Stopped
the train and found Boy Charles in
the boxcar with three of them
hobos. Must have got mad when they
couldn’t find the piano ‘cause they
set the boxcar afire and killed
everybody. Now, nobody know who
done that. Some people say it was
Sutter ‘cause it was his piano.
Some people say it was Sheriff
Carter. Some people say it was
Robert Smith and Ed Saunders. But
don’t nobody know for sure. It was
about two months after that that Ed
Saunders fell down his well. Just
upped and fell down his well for no
reason. People say it was the
ghost of them men who burned up in
the boxcar that pushed him in his
well. They started calling them
the Ghosts of the Yellow Dog. Now
that’s how all that got started and
that why we say Berniece ain’t
gonna sell that piano. ‘Cause her
daddy died over it.
57.
58.
BOY WILLIE
All that’s in the past. If my
daddy had seen where he could have
traded that piano in for some land
of his own, it wouldn’t be sitting
up here now. He spent his whole
life farming on somebody else’s
land. I ain’t gonna do that. See,
he couldn’t do no better. When he
come along he ain’t had nothing he
could build on. His daddy ain’t
had nothing to give him. The only
thing my daddy had to give me was
that piano. And he died over
giving me that. I ain’t gonna let
it sit up there and rot without
trying to do something with it. If
Berniece can’t see that, then I’m
gonna go ahead and sell my half.
And you and Wining Boy know I’m
right.
DOAKER
Ain’t nobody said nothing about
who’s right and who’s wrong. I was
just telling the man about the
piano. I was telling him why we
say Berniece ain’t gonna sell it.
LYMON
Yeah, I can see why you say that
now. I told Boy Willie he ought to
stay up here with me.
BOY WILLIE
You stay! I’m going back! That’s
what I’m gonna do with my life!
Why I got to come up here and learn
to do something I don’t know how to
do when I already know how to farm?
You stay up here and make your own
way if that’s what you want to do.
I’m going back and live my life the
way I want to live it.

BERNIECE

Wining Boy sitting there.
WINING BOY
Hey, Berniece.
58A.

BERNIECE
You all had this planned. You and
Boy Willie had this planned.
WINING BOY
I didn’t know he was gonna be here.
I’m on my way down home. I stopped
by to see you and Doaker first.
DOAKER
I told the nigger he left out of
here with that sack of money, we
thought we might never see him
again. Boy Willie say he wasn’t
gonna see him till he got broke. I
looked up and seen him sitting on
the doorstep asking for two
dollars. Look at him laughing. He
know it’s the truth.
BERNIECE
Boy Willie, I didn’t see that truck
out there. I thought you was out
selling watermelons.
BOY WILLIE
We done sold them all. Sold the
truck too.
BERNIECE
I don’t want to go through none of
your stuff. I done told you to go
back where you belong.
BOY WILLIE
I was just teasing you, woman. You
can’t take no teasing?
BERNIECE
Wining Boy, when you get here?
WINING BOY
A little while ago. I took the
train from Kansas City.
BERNIECE
Let me go upstairs and change and
then I’ll cook you something to
eat.
BOY WILLIE
You ain’t cooked me nothing when I
come.
59.

BERNIECE
Boy Willie, go on and leave me
alone. Come on, Maretha, get up
here and change your clothes before
you get them dirty.
Maretha follows Berniece up the stairs.
WINING BOY
Maretha sure getting big, ain’t
she, Doaker. And just as pretty as
she want to be. I didn’t know
Crawley had it in him.
Boy Willie crosses to the piano.
BOY WILLIE
Hey, Lymon...get up on the other
side of this piano and let me see
something.
WINING BOY
Boy Willie, what is you doing?
BOY WILLIE
I’m seeing how heavy this piano is.
Get up over there, Lymon.
WINING BOY
Go on and leave that piano alone.
You ain’t taking that piano out of
here and selling it.
BOY WILLIE
Just as soon as I get them
watermelons out that truck.
WINING BOY
Well, I got something to say about
that.
BOY WILLIE
This my daddy’s piano.
WINING BOY
He ain’t took it by himself. Me
and Doaker helped him.
BOY WILLIE
He died by himself. Where was you
and Doaker at then? Don’t come
telling me nothing about this
piano. This is me and Berniece’s
piano. Am I right, Doaker?
60.
61.
DOAKER
Yeah, you right.
BOY WILLIE
Let’s see if we can lift it up,
Lymon. Get a good grip on it and
pick it up on your end. Ready?
Lift!
With difficulty Boy Willie and Lymon move the piano a bit.
BOY WILLIE (CONT'D)
What you think?
LYMON
It’s heavy...but you can move it.
Only it ain’t gonna be easy.
BOY WILLIE
It wasn’t that heavy to me. Okay
let’s put it back.
As they start to move the piano, Doaker hears a FLOORBOARD
CREAK behind him. He turns. Nothing there.
As they move it back they all react when they hear an out of
tune chord, like someone just BANGED ON THE KEYS. Then a
loud SLAM when the PIANO’S FALL BOARD SLAMS SHUT.
INT. CHARLES HOUSE / UPSTAIRS BEDROOM - NIGHTB65 B65
Berniece, changing out of her work clothes, hears the piano
commotion downstairs - she stops.
CLOSE ON THE RADIO NEEDLE: The needle goes haywire, Sutter’s
ghost embodies it for a brief moment.
Berniece enters on the stairs:
BERNIECE
Boy Willie...you gonna play around
with me one too many times. And
then God’s gonna bless you and West
is gonna dress you. Now set that
piano back over there.
BOY WILLIE
I’m trying to get me some land,
woman. I need that piano to get me
some money so I can buy Sutter’s
land.
61.
61A.
BERNIECE
Money can’t buy what that piano
cost. You can’t sell your soul for
money. It won’t go with the buyer.
It’ll shrivel and shrink to know
that you ain’t taken on to it. But
it won’t go with the buyer.
61A.
(MORE)
62.
BOY WILLIE
I ain’t talking about selling my
soul, woman. I’m talking about
trading that piece of wood for some
land. Land the only thing God
ain’t making no more of. You can
always get you another piano. I’m
talking about some land. What you
get something out the ground from.
You can’t do nothing with that
piano but sit up there and look at
it.
BERNIECE
That’s just what I’m gonna do.
Wining Boy, you want me to fry you
some pork chops?
BOY WILLIE
Now, I’m gonna tell you the way I
see it. The only thing that make
that piano worth something is them
carvings Papa Boy Willie put on
there. That’s what make it worth
something. That was my great-
granddaddy. Papa Boy Charles
brought that piano into the house.
Now, I’m supposed to build on what
they left me. You can’t do nothing
with that piano sitting up here in
the house. That’s just like if I
let them watermelons sit out there
and rot. I’d be a fool. Alright
now, if you say to me, Boy Willie,
I’m using that piano. I give out
lessons on it and that help me make
my rent or whatever then that be
something else I’d have to go on
and say, well, Berniece using that
piano. She building on it. Let
her go on and use it. But Doaker
say you ain’t touched that piano
the whole time it’s been up here.
So why you wanna stand in my way?
See, you just looking at the
sentimental value. That’s good.
But I ain’t gonna be no fool about
no sentimental value. You can sit
up here and look at the piano for
the next hundred years and it’s
just gonna be a piano. I get
Sutter’s land and I can go down and
cash in the crop and get my seed.
(MORE)
62.
BOY WILLIE (CONT'D)
63.
As long as I got the land and the
seed then I’m alright. ‘Cause that
land give back to you. But that
piano don’t put out nothing else.
You ain’t got nothing working for
you. Now, the kind of man my daddy
was he would have understood that.
I’m sorry you can’t see it that
way. But that’s why I’m gonna take
that piano out of here and sell it.
BERNIECE
(crosses to the piano)
Look at this piano. Look at it.
Mama Ola polished this piano with
her tears for seventeen years. For
seventeen years she rubbed on it
till her hands bled. Then she
rubbed the blood in...mixed it up
with the rest of the blood on it.
Every day that God breathed life
into her body she rubbed and
cleaned and polished and prayed
over it. “Play something for me,
Berniece. Play something for me,
Berniece.” Every day. “I cleaned
it up for you, play something for
me, Berniece.” You always talking
about your daddy but you ain’t
never stopped to look at what his
foolishness cost your mama.
Seventeen years’ worth of cold
nights and an empty bed. For what?
For a piano? For a piece of wood?
To get even with somebody? I look
at you and you’re all the same.
You, Papa Boy Charles, Wining Boy,
Doaker, Crawley...you’re all alike.
All this thieving and killing and
thieving and killing. And what it
ever lead to? More killing and
more thieving. I ain’t never seen
it come to nothing. People getting
burned up. People getting shot.
People falling down their wells.
It don’t never stop.

Come on now, Berniece, ain’t no
need in getting upset.

I done a little bit of stealing
here and there, but I ain’t never
killed nobody. I can’t be speaking
for nobody else. You all got to
speak for yourself, but I ain’t
never killed nobody.
BERNIECE
You killed Crawley just as sure as
if you pulled the trigger.
BOY WILLIE
See, that’s ignorant. That’s
downright foolish for you to say
something like that. You ain’t
doing nothing but showing your
ignorance. If the nigger was here
I’d whup his ass for getting me and
Lymon shot at.
BERNIECE
Crawley ain’t knew about the wood.
BOY WILLIE
We told the man about the wood.
Ask Lymon. He knew all about the
wood. He seen we was sneaking it.
Why else we gonna be out there at
night? Don’t come telling me
Crawley ain’t knew about the wood.
Them fellows come up on us and
Crawley tried to bully them. Me
and Lymon seen the sheriff with
them and give in. Wasn’t no sense
in getting killed over fifty
dollars’ worth of wood.
BERNIECE
Crawley ain’t knew you stole that
wood.
BOY WILLIE
We ain’t stole no wood. Me and
Lymon was hauling wood and keeping
us a little bit on the side. We
dumped our little bit down there by
the creek till we had enough to
make a load. Some fellows seen us
and we figured we better get it
before they did. We come up there
and got Crawley to help us load it.
Figured we’d cut him in.

from his door...we was trying to

Me and Boy Willie told him about
the wood. We told him some fellows
might be trying to beat us to it.
He say let me go back and get my
thirty-eight. That’s what caused
all the trouble.

sheriff with them and we tried to

the bend in the creek...but they
was down there too. Boy Willie say

out his gun and started shooting.
That’s when they started shooting

Crawley’s dead and in the ground

Doaker sings “I’m Going to Memphis” quietly to himself as he
rolls a cigarette. Wining Boy walks up carrying a suit.
DOAKER
I thought you took that suit to the
pawn shop?
WINING BOY
I went down there and the man tell
me the suit is too old. Look at
this suit. This is one hundred per
cent silk! How a silk suit gonna
get too old? Best he wanna give me
is three dollars. I figure a silk
suit is worth five dollars all over
the world. I wasn’t gonna part
with it for no three dollars so I
brought it back.
DOAKER
They got another pawn shop on
Wylie.
WINING BOY
I carried it up there. He say he
don’t take no clothes. Only thing
he take is guns and radios. Where
is Berniece?
DOAKER
Berniece still at work. Boy Willie
went down there to meet Lymon this
morning. I guess they got that
truck fixed, they been out there
all day and ain’t come back yet.

Sutter couldn’t have been dead more
than three days. He was sitting in
there at the piano. I come out to
go to work...and he was sitting
right there. Had his hand on top
of his head just like Berniece
said. I believe he broke his neck
when he fell in the well. I kept
quiet about it. I didn’t see no
reason to upset Berniece.
WINING BOY
Did he say anything? Did he say he
was looking for Boy Willie?
DOAKER
He was just sitting there. He
ain’t said nothing. I went on out
the door and left him sitting
there. I figure as long as he was
on the other side of the room
everything be alright. I don’t
know what I would have done if he
had started walking toward me.
WINING BOY
Berniece say he was calling Boy
Willie’s name.
DOAKER
I ain’t heard him say nothing. He
was just sitting there when I seen
him. But I don’t believe Boy
Willie pushed him in the well.
Sutter here ‘cause of that piano.
Berniece need to go on and get rid
of it. It ain’t done nothing but
cause trouble.
WINING BOY
I agree with Berniece. Boy Charles
ain’t took it to give it back. He
took it ‘cause he figure he had
more right to it than Sutter did.
If Sutter can’t understand
that...then that’s just the way
that go. Sutter dead and in the
ground...don’t care where his ghost
is. He can hover around and play
on the piano all he want. I want
to see him carry it out the house.
That’s what I want to see. What
time Berniece get home?

what kind of business you got.
DOAKER
Berniece ain’t got no money. If
that’s why you was trying to catch
her. She having a hard enough time
trying to get by as it is.
WINING BOY
Well let me have five dollars.
DOAKER
I just give you a dollar before you
left out of here. You ain’t gonna
take my five dollars out there and
gamble and drink it up.
WINING BOY
Aw, nigger, give me five dollars.
I’ll give it back to you.
DOAKER
You wasn’t looking to give me five
dollars when you had that sack of
money. You wasn’t looking to throw
nothing my way. Now you wanna come
over here and borrow five dollars.
If you going back with Boy Willie
you need to be trying to figure out
how you gonna get train fare.
WINING BOY
That’s why I need the five dollars.
If I had five dollars I could get
me some money.
Doaker goes into his pocket.

Look here, Lymon...see this? Look

you.
Lymon tries the suit coat on.
WINING BOY (CONT'D)
Look at that. Feel it. That’s one
hundred per cent genuine silk. I
got that in Chicago. You can’t get
clothes like that nowhere but New
York and Chicago. You can’t get
clothes like that in Pittsburgh.
These folks in Pittsburgh ain’t
never seen clothes like that.
LYMON
This is nice, feel real nice and
smooth.
WINING BOY
That’s a fifty-five-dollar suit.
That’s the kind of suit the big

Look at that...see how it fits you?
Give me three dollars and go on and

Got a shirt to go with it. Cost

That look nice...if you like that

dress up kind of clothes. If you
like it, look real nice.
WINING BOY
That’s the kind of suit you need
for up here in the North.
LYMON
Four dollars for everything? The
suit and the shirt?
WINING BOY
That’s cheap. I should be charging

Doaker exits into his room.

Let’s go to the picture show, Boy
Willie. Let’s go find some women.

Hey, Lymon, how many of them
watermelons would you say we got

load...right?
LYMON
About that much. Maybe a little
more.

Wining Boy returns with the shoes.
WINING BOY
Here you go...size nine. Put them
on. Cost you three dollars.
That’s a Florsheim shoe. That’s
the kind Stagger Lee wore.
LYMON

You sure these size nine?
WINING BOY
You can look at my feet and see we
wear the same size. Man, you put
on that suit and them shoes and you
got something there. You ready for
whatever’s out there. But is they
ready for you? With them shoes on
you be the King of the Walk. Have
everybody stop to look at your
shoes. Wishing they had a pair.
I’ll give you a break. Go on and
take them for two dollars.
Lymon pays Wining Boy two dollars.
LYMON
Come on, Boy Willie...let’s go find
some women. I’m gonna go upstairs
and get ready. I’ll be ready to go

would have been his daddy! His
daddy’s dead now...but I got the
nigger out of jail one time. They
was fixing to name him Daniel and
walk him through the Lion’s Den.
That’s how the whole thing come
about between me and Lymon’s mama.
She know me and his daddy used to
run together. He got in jail and
she come there and got me where I
was playing at this saloon... said
she had all but fifty dollars to
get him out. Ask if I could help.
Now the way I figured it... without
that fifty dollars the sheriff was
gonna turn him over to Parchman.
Now I’m gonna say it right... I
will give anybody fifty dollars to
keep them out of jail. I give her
fifty dollars and she told me to
come over to his house. I ain’t
asked her. I ain’t had to say a
word.

Fellow walked in and shot him
thinking he was somebody else.
Doaker enters from his room in his uniform.
WINING BOY (CONT'D)
Hey, Doaker, you remember L.D.
Jackson?
DOAKER
That’s Lymon’s daddy. That was one
bad luck nigger.
BOY WILLIE
Look like you ready to railroad
some.
DOAKER
Yeah, I got to make that run.
Lymon enters from the stairs. He is dressed in his new suit
and shoes, each of which are far too small.
LYMON
How I look?
WINING BOY
You look like a million dollars.
Don’t he look good, Doaker? Come
on, let’s play some cards. You
wanna play some cards?
BOY WILLIE
We ain’t gonna play no cards with
you. Me and Lymon gonna find some
women. Hey, Lymon, don’t play no
cards with Wining Boy. He’ll take
all your money.
WINING BOY
(to Lymon)
You got a magic suit there. You
can get you a woman easy with that
suit...but you got to know the
magic words. You know the magic
words to get you a woman?
LYMON
I just talk to them to see if I
like them and they like me.
WINING BOY (CONT'D)
77.
78.
WINING BOY
You just walk right up to them and
say, “If you got the harbor I got
the ship.” If that don’t work ask
them if you can put them in your
pocket. The first thing they gonna
say is, “It’s too small.” That’s
when you look them dead in the eye
and say, “Baby, ain’t nothing small
about me.” If that don’t work then
you move on to another one. Am I
telling him right, Doaker?
DOAKER
That man don’t need you to tell him
nothing about no women. These
women these days ain’t gonna fall
for that kind of stuff. You got to
buy them a present. That’s what
they looking for these days.
BOY WILLIE
Come on, I’m ready. You ready
Lymon? Come on, let’s go find some
women.
WINING BOY
Here, let me walk out with you. I
wanna see the women fall out their
window when they see Lymon.
Wining Boy holds the door open for Boy Willie and Lymon as
they step out into golden, magic-hour light.
INT. CRAWFORD GRILL - NIGHT79 79
ON THE GOLDEN GLEAM OF A ROW OF BRASS as the band belts out
“Minnie the Moocher” by Cab Calloway. MOVE PAST the horns TO
REVEAL the stunning lead singer, LUCILLE. This band is on
fire.
Fast feet and twisting bodies on the dance floor. CAMERA
FINDS Boy Willie, Lymon and Wining Boy as they enter the
club, heads high, pockets full and ready to take on the
world.
INT. CRAWFORD GRILL - LATER80 80
The band has slowed it down as Lymon sits at the bar alone
grooving to the music. Then he locks eyes with a pretty,
young woman in a RED DRESS (GRACE) sitting by herself. Shy,
he looks away. And when he looks back, she grins.
78.
79.
Then Lymon waves at the bartender and orders two whiskeys.
The bartender pours the drinks. But when Lymon turns and
looks back at Grace she’s laughing as Boy Willie whispers
into her ear. Grace steals glances at Lymon while Boy Willie
sweet talks her. Then Boy Willie pulls her to the dance
floor.
Dejected, Lymon turns back to the bar. A beat, then he spots
a woman at the bar (DOLLY). They exchange grins and Lymon
offers her a whiskey.
INT. BERNIECE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT81 81
Berniece and Maretha kneel side by side next to the bed. They
recite their nighttime prayers in tandem.
BERNIECE
Now I lay me down to sleep, I
pray the lord my soul to
keep. If I should die before
I wake, I pray the Lord my
soul to take.
MARETHA
Now I lay me down to sleep, I
pray the lord my soul to
keep. If I should die before
I wake, I pray the Lord my
soul to take.
The light in her room flickers then dies.
She turns the switch, it doesn’t work.
She rummages through her side table drawer and grabs a
candlestick.
INT. UPSTAIRS BATHROOM - NIGHTA81 A81
Berniece finds a matchbook in the medicine cabinet. She
closes the cabinet door, and in the mirror we see THE SHADOW
OF SUTTER behind her, she doesn’t see him.
She slowly turns, her feet now in a SHEET OF WATER. The
strike of her match illuminates SUTTER’S GHOSTLY FACE. He
goes to grab her when...
INT. CHARLES HOUSE/BERNIECE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT82 82
Berniece’s eyes snap open, flush with nightmare-fear. She
looks over at Maretha sleeping soundly.
EXT. CHARLES HOUSE / BACK PORCH - NIGHT82A 82A
Berniece retrieves a metal tub from the back porch.
79.
79aA.
INT. CHARLES HOUSE/KITCHEN/PARLOR - NIGHT83 83
STEAM as Berniece pours boiling water into a tin tub. Then
in a voyeuristic POV we watch as she pulls off her robe, her
nudity obscured by various objects in frame.
Suddenly, A CREAKY DOOR SHUTS ON IT’S OWN. She turns,
fearful.
BERNIECE
Maretha...?
Nothing there. She gets in the tub, quick, almost like a
child pulling the blankets over their head.
Several beats then she finally calms down, sinks into the
warmth and closes her eyes.
EXT. RIVER - MAGIC HOUR (FLASHBACK)84 84
Berniece stands alone in neck deep water. Then Crawley
surfaces right in front of her.
79aA.
79A.
His golden crucifix glistens. They lean in for a kiss and
somewhere there is a KNOCK.
BACK TO:
79A.
80.
INT. CHARLES HOUSE/KITCHEN/PARLOR - NIGHT85 85
Berniece opens her eyes and now we realize she’s wearing
Crawley’s crucifix.
BERNIECE
Who is it?
AVERY (O.S.)
It’s me, Avery.
Berniece deflates.
MOMENTS LATER, Berniece tightens her bathrobe and opens the
front door.
BERNIECE
Avery, come on in. I was just
taking my bath.
AVERY
Where Boy Willie? I see that truck
out there almost empty. They done
sold almost all them watermelons.
BERNIECE
They were gone when I come home. I
don’t know where they went off to.
What Mr. Cohen say about letting
you have the place?
AVERY
He say he’ll let me have it for
thirty dollars a month. I talked
him out of thirty-five.
BERNIECE
That’s a nice spot next to Benny
Diamond’s store.
AVERY
Berniece...I be at home and I get
to thinking you up here an’ I’m
down there. I get to thinking how
that look to have a preacher that
ain’t married. It makes for a
better congregation if the preacher
was settled down and married.
BERNIECE
Avery...not now.
80.
81.
AVERY
You know how I feel about you,
Berniece. Now...I done got the
place from Mr. Cohen. I get the
money from the bank and I can fix
it up real nice. They give me a
ten-cents-a-hour raise down there
on the job...now Berniece, I ain’t
got much in the way of comforts. I
got a hole in my pockets near about
as far as money is concerned. I
ain’t never found no way through
life to a woman I care about like I
care about you. I need that. I
need somebody on my bond side. I
need a woman that fits in my hand.
BERNIECE
Avery, I ain’t ready to get married
now.
AVERY
You too young a woman to close up,
Berniece.
BERNIECE
I ain’t said nothing about closing
up. I got a lot of woman left in
me.
AVERY
Where’s it at? When’s the last
time you looked at it?
BERNIECE
(stunned by his remark)
That’s a nasty thing to say. And
you call yourself a preacher.
AVERY
Any time I get anywhere near
you...you push me away.
BERNIECE
I got enough on my hands with
Maretha. I got enough people to
love and take care of.
AVERY
Who you got to love you? Can’t
nobody get close enough to you.
Doaker can’t half say nothing to
you. You jump all over Boy Willie.
Who you got to love you, Berniece?
81.
(MORE)
82.
BERNIECE
You trying to tell me a woman can’t
be nothing without a man. But you
alright, huh? You can just walk
out of here without me - without a
woman - and still be a man. That’s
alright. Ain’t nobody gonna ask
you, “Avery, who you got to love
you?” That’s alright for you. But
everybody gonna be worried about
Berniece. “How Berniece gonna take
care of herself? How she gonna
raise that child without a man?
Wonder what she do with herself.
How she gonna live like that?”
Everybody got all kinds of
questions for Berniece. Everybody
telling me I can’t be a woman
unless I got a man. Well, you tell
me, Avery - you know - how much
woman am I?
AVERY
It wasn’t me, Berniece. You can’t
blame me for nobody else.
BERNIECE
I ain’t blaming nobody for nothing.
I’m just stating the facts.
AVERY
(beat)
How long you gonna carry Crawley
with you, Berniece? It’s been over
three years. At some point you got
to let go and go on. Life’s got
all kinds of twists and turns.
That don’t mean you stop living.
Crawley’s been dead three years.
Three years, Berniece.
BERNIECE
I know how long Crawley’s been
dead. You ain’t got to tell me
that. I just ain’t ready to get
married right now.
AVERY
What is you ready for, Berniece?
You just gonna drift along from day
to day. Life is more than making
it from one day to another. You
gonna look up one day and it’s all
gonna be past you.
(MORE)
82.
AVERY (CONT'D)
83.
I’m standing here now, Berniece -
but I don’t know how much longer
I’m gonna be standing here waiting
on you.
BERNIECE
Avery, I told you...when you get
your church we’ll sit down and talk
about this. I got too many other
things to deal with right now. Boy
Willie and the piano...and Sutter’s
ghost. I thought I might have been
seeing things, but Maretha done
seen Sutter’s ghost, too.
AVERY
When this happen, Berniece?
BERNIECE
Right after I came home yesterday.
Maretha scared to sleep up there
now. Maybe if you bless the house
he’ll go away.
AVERY
I don’t know, Berniece. I don’t
know if I should fool around with
something like that.
BERNIECE
I can’t have Maretha scared to go
to sleep up there. Seem like if
you bless the house he would go
away.
AVERY
You might have to be a special kind
of preacher to do something like
that.
BERNIECE
I keep telling myself when Boy
Willie leave he’ll go on and leave
with him. I believe Boy Willie
pushed him in the well.
AVERY
That’s been going on down there for
a long time. The Ghosts of the
Yellow Dog been pushing people in
their wells long before Boy Willie
got grown.
AVERY (CONT'D)
83.
(MORE)
84.
BERNIECE
Somebody down there pushing them
people in their wells. They ain’t
just upped and fell. Ain’t no wind
push nobody in their well.
AVERY
Oh, I don’t know. God works in
mysterious ways.
BERNIECE
He ain’t pushed nobody in their
wells.
AVERY
He caused it to happen. God is the
Great Causer. He can do anything.
He parted the Red Sea. He say, “I
will smite my enemies.” Reverend
Thompson used to preach on the
Ghosts of the Yellow Dog as the
hand of God.
BERNIECE
I don’t care who preached what.
Somebody down there pushing them
people in their wells. Somebody
like Boy Willie. I believe he
pushed Sutter so he could get his
land.
AVERY
What Doaker say about Boy Willie
selling the piano?
BERNIECE
Doaker don’t want no part of that
piano. He ain’t never wanted no
part of it. He blames himself for
not staying behind with Papa Boy
Charles. He washed his hands of
that piano a long time ago. He
didn’t want me to bring it up here -
but I wasn’t gonna leave it down
there.
AVERY
Well it seems to me somebody ought
to be able to talk to Boy Willie.
BERNIECE
You can’t talk to Boy Willie. He
been that way all his life. He
don’t listen to nobody.
(MORE)
84.
BERNIECE (CONT'D)
85.
He just like my daddy. He get his
mind fixed on something and can’t
nobody turn him from it.
AVERY
You ought to start a choir at the
church. Maybe if he seen you was
doing something with it - if you
told him you was gonna put it in my
church - maybe he’d see it
different.
BERNIECE
I done told you I don’t play on
that piano. Ain’t no need in you
to keep talking this choir stuff.
When my mama died I shut the top on
that piano and I ain’t never opened
it since. I was only playing it
for her...
INT. MAMA OLA’S HOUSE - NIGHTA85 A85
1914, Mississippi. A small room with worn, sweating, white
walls.
A series of vignettes, all in 36FPS:
- Raindrops congregate on a window sill.
- YOUNG BERNIECE (13) and MAMA OLA’s hands hand in hand.
YOUNG BOY WILLIE looks on.
BERNIECE (V.O.)
...When my daddy died seem like all
her life went into that piano. She
used to have me playing on it...say
when I played it she could hear my
daddy talking to her...
- Young Berniece lays in her mother’s lap. MAMA OLA’s hands
touch her face. The lights dim, then come back on and
suddenly it’s 35-year-old Berniece on her mother’s lap. Mama
Ola’s older hands now touching her face.
BERNIECE (V.O.)
I used to think them pictures come
alive and walked through the house.
Sometime late at night I could hear
my mama talking to them. I said
that wasn’t gonna happen to me...
BERNIECE (CONT'D)
85.
85A.
- Mama Ola stands by the Piano, her eyes pleading for
Berniece to play. Berniece looks on.
INT. CHARLES HOUSE/KITCHEN/PARLOR - NIGHTB85 B85
BACK TO:
BERNIECE
...I don’t play that piano ‘cause I
don’t want to wake them spirits.
They never be walking around in
this house.
AVERY
You got to put all of that behind
you, Berniece. That’s the same
thing like Crawley. Everybody got
stones in their passway. You got
to step over them or walk around
them. You picking them up and
carrying them with you. All you
got to do is set them down by the
side of the road. You ain’t got to
carry them with you. You can walk
over there right now and play that
piano. You can walk over there
right now and God will walk over
there with you. Right now you can
set that sack of stones down by the
side of the road and walk away from
it.
Avery crosses over to the piano and raises the fall board.
85A.
86.
AVERY (CONT'D)
Come on, Berniece...set it down and
walk away from it. Walk over here
and claim it as an instrument of
the Lord. You can walk over here
right now and make it into a
celebration.
BERNIECE
Avery...I done told you I don’t
want to play that piano. Now or no
other time.
AVERY
The Bible say, “The Lord is my
refuge...and my strength!” With
the strength of God you can put the
past behind you, Berniece. With
the strength of God you can do
anything! God don’t ask what you
done...God ask what you gonna do.
All you got to do is walk over here
and claim it.
BERNIECE
Avery, just go on and let me finish
my bath. I’ll see you tomorrow.
AVERY
Okay, Berniece. I’m gonna go home.
I’m gonna go home and read up on my
Bible. And tomorrow...if the good
Lord give me strength
tomorrow...I’m gonna come by and
bless the house...and show you the
power of the Lord.
INT. CRAWFORD GRILL - NIGHT86 86
Sweat and sex ooze as Lucille sings a sultry song a la “Shave
‘em Dry”.
ON THE DANCE FLOOR Boy Willie holds Grace tight as he speaks
into her ear:
BOY WILLIE
We don’t need no room. My
granddaddy used to take women on
the backs of horses.
GRACE
You sure is country. I didn’t know
you was this country.
86.
87.
BOY WILLIE
There’s a lot of things you don’t
know about me. Come on, let me
show you what this country boy can
do.
GRACE
Let’s go to my place. I got a room
with a bed if Leroy don’t come back
there.
BOY WILLIE
Who’s Leroy? You ain’t said
nothing about no Leroy.
GRACE
He used to be my man. He ain’t
coming back.
BOY WILLIE
You let him have your key?
GRACE
He ain’t coming back.
BOY WILLIE
Did you let him have your key?
GRACE
He got a key but he ain’t coming
back.
TUCKED AWAY IN A BOOTH, Lymon sits with Dolly but he’s
staring through the crowd at Boy Willie and Grace dancing.
Dolly downs her whiskey, drunk. Then Lymon sees Boy Willie
and Grace leaving. Dolly leans into Lymon with her glass:
DOLLY
I’m empty.
Lymon throws her a look. He’s not into her or this place.
EXT./INT. CHARLES HOUSE - NIGHT87 87
Lymon walks up to the house. He STOPS and looks in through a
window where Berniece turns on a light and puts on the
teakettle. He watches for a beat, then he moves to the door
and KNOCKS.
Berniece opens the door. Lymon enters.
87.
88.
LYMON
How you doing, Berniece? I thought
you’d be asleep. Boy Willie been
back here?
BERNIECE
He just left out of here a minute
ago.
LYMON
I went out to see a picture show
and never got there. We always end
up doing something else. I was
with this woman she just wanted to
drink up all my money. So I left
her there and came back looking for
Boy Willie.
BERNIECE
You just missed him.
LYMON
They got some nice-looking women in
this city. I’m gonna like it up
here real good. I like seeing them
with their dresses on. Got them
high heels. I like that. Make
them look like they real precious.
Boy Willie met a real nice one
today. I wish I had met her before
he did.
BERNIECE
He come by here with some woman a
little while ago. I told him to go
on and take all that out of my
house.
LYMON
What she look like, the woman he
was with? Was she a brown-skinned
woman about this high? Nice and
healthy? Got nice hips on her?
BERNIECE
She had on a red dress.
LYMON
That’s her! That’s Grace. She
real nice. Laugh a lot. Some of
these women act like they the Queen
of Sheba. I don’t like them kind.
Grace ain’t like that. She real
nice with herself.
88.
(MORE)
89.
BERNIECE
I don’t know what she was like. He
come in here all drunk knocking
over the lamp, and making all kind
of noise. I can’t really say what
she was like.
LYMON
(after a beat)
Doaker gone, huh? He say he had to
make a trip.
BERNIECE
Yeah, he gone on his trip. This is
when I can usually get me some
peace and quiet, Maretha asleep.
LYMON
She look just like you. Got them
big eyes. I remember her when she
was in diapers.
BERNIECE
Time just keep on. It go on with
or without you. She going on
twelve.
LYMON
She sure is pretty. I like kids.
BERNIECE
Boy Willie say you staying...what
you gonna do up here in this big
city? You thought about that?
LYMON
They never get me back down there.
They gonna try and make me work for
Stovall when he don’t pay nothing.
It ain’t like that up here.
BERNIECE
This ain’t a bad city once you get
to know your way around.
LYMON
I figure I find me a job unloading
boxcars or something. One fellow
told me say he know a place.
BERNIECE
You shouldn’t have too much
trouble. It’s all in how you
present yourself.
(MORE)
89.
BERNIECE (CONT'D)
(MORE)
90.
See now, Boy Willie couldn’t get no
job up here. Somebody hire him
they got a pack of trouble on their
hands. Soon as they find that out
they fire him. He don’t want to do
nothing unless he do it his way.
LYMON
I know. I told him let’s go to the
picture show first and see if there
was any women down there. They
might get tired of sitting at home
and walk down to the picture show.
He say he wanna look around first.
We tried a couple of places and
then we went to this saloon where
he met Grace. We left Wining Boy
sitting down there running his
mouth. He told me if I wear this
suit I’d find me a woman. He was
almost right.
BERNIECE
You don’t need to be out there in
them saloons. Ain’t no telling
what you liable to run into out
there. This one liable to cut you
as quick as that one shoot you.
You don’t need to be out there.
You start out that fast life you
can’t keep it up. It makes you old
quick. I don’t know what them
women out there be thinking about.
LYMON
Mostly they be lonely and looking
for somebody to spend the night
with them. Sometimes it matters
who it is and sometimes it don’t.
I used to be the same way. Now it
got to matter. That’s why I’m here
now. I like women to be with me in
a nice and easy way. That way we
can both enjoy ourselves. The way
I see it we the only two people
like us in the world. We got to
see how we fit together. A woman
that don’t want to take the time to
do that I don’t bother with. Used
to. Used to bother with all of
them. How come you ain’t married?
It seem like to me you would be
married.
BERNIECE (CONT'D)
(MORE)
90.
LYMON (CONT'D)
91.
I remember Avery from down home. I
used to call him plain old Avery.
Now he Reverend Avery. That’s
kinda funny about him becoming a
preacher. I like when he told
about how that come to him in a
dream about them sheep people and
them hobos. Nothing ever came to
me in a dream like that. I just
dream about women. Can’t never
seem to find the right one.
BERNIECE
She out there somewhere. You just
got to get yourself ready to meet
her. That’s what I’m trying to do.
Avery’s alright. I ain’t really
got nobody in mind.
LYMON
I get me a job and a little place
and get set up to where I can make
a woman comfortable I might get
married. Avery’s nice. You ought
to go ahead and get married. You
be a preacher’s wife you won’t have
to work. I hate living by myself.
I didn’t want to be no strain on my
mama so I left home when I was
about sixteen. Everything I tried
seem like it just didn’t work out.
Now I’m trying this.
BERNIECE
You keep trying it’ll work out for
you.
LYMON
It’s getting kind of late. I don’t
know where Boy Willie went off to.
He’s liable not to come back. I’m
gonna take off these shoes. My
feet hurt. Was you in bed? I
don’t mean to be keeping you up.
BERNIECE
You ain’t keeping me up. I
couldn’t sleep after that Boy
Willie woke me up.
LYMON (CONT'D)
91.
92.
LYMON
You got on that nightgown. I likes
women they wear them fancy
nightclothes and all. It makes
their skin look real pretty.
BERNIECE
I got this at the five-and-ten-
cents store. It ain’t so fancy.
LYMON
I don’t too often get to see a
woman dressed like that.
There is a long pause. Lymon takes off his suit coat.
LYMON (CONT'D)
Well, I’m gonna sleep here on the
couch. I’m supposed to sleep on
the floor but I don’t reckon Boy
Wille’s coming back tonight.
Wining Boy sold me this suit. Told
me it was a magic suit. I’m gonna
put it on again tomorrow. Maybe it
bring me a woman like he say.
Lymon goes into his pocket and pulls out a small bottle of
perfume.
LYMON (CONT'D)
I almost forgot I had this. Some
man sold me this for a dollar. Say
it come from Paris. This is the
same kind of perfume the Queen of
France wear. That’s what he told
me. I don’t know if it’s true or
not. I smelled it. It smelled
good to me. Here...smell it see if
you like it.
BERNIECE
(takes the bottle)
It smells nice.
LYMON
Go on, take it.
BERNIECE
I can’t take it. Here...you keep
it. You’ll find somebody to give
it to.
92.
93.
LYMON
I wanna give it to you. Make you
smell nice.
Lymon puts perfume behind Berniece’s ear.
LYMON (CONT'D)
They tell me you supposed to put it
right here behind your ear. Say if
you put it there you smell nice all
day.
Berniece stiffens at his touch. He bends down to smell her.
LYMON (CONT'D)
There...you smell real good now.
(kissing her neck)
You smell real good for Lymon.
He kisses her again. Berniece returns the kiss, then breaks
the embrace and crosses to the stairs. She turns and they
look silently at each other. Lymon hands her the bottle of
perfume. She thinks for a beat, then accepts. A promise of
things to come? Then Berniece exits up the stairs.
Lymon picks up his suit coat and strokes it lovingly with the
full knowledge that it is indeed a magic suit.
EXT. BOY CHARLES’ SHACK - DAY (FLASHBACK)88 88

INT. CHARLES HOUSE/PARLOR/KITCHEN - DAY89 89

BOY WILLIE
Come on, get up, nigger!
LYMON

Boy Willie dumps Lymon on the floor.
BOY WILLIE (CONT'D)
Come on, get up!
LYMON
Why you leave last night, I looked

BOY WILLIE
I come back here with Grace, then I

LYMON

LYMON

BOY WILLIE
He say to bring it on out.
LYMON
Why didn’t you tell him to come

BOY WILLIE
He want to charge twenty-five
dollars to pick it up. Come on,

Lymon gets up and follows Boy Willie to the piano.
BOY WILLIE (CONT'D)
Get that end over there. Get a
real good grip on it now. Alright.
You got it good?
94.
95.
LYMON
Yeah, I got it.
BOY WILLIE
Ready? Lift!
They strain to move the piano but it doesn’t budge.
LYMON
Man, this piano is heavy! It’s
gonna take more than me and you to
move this piano.
BOY WILLIE
We can do it. Come on - we did it
before.
LYMON
Nigger - you crazy! That piano
weighs five hundred pounds!
BOY WILLIE
I got three hundred pounds of it!
I know you can carry two hundred
pounds! You be lifting them cotton
sacks! Come on lift this piano!
They heave. The WOOD GROANS, almost like a slave ship at
sea. And the piano shifts a few inches only to be YANKED
back into place -- like a tug-of-war with the spirit world.

As Doaker dresses he reacts to the commotion out in the
parlor.
INT. CHARLES HOUSE/PARLOR - SIMULTANEOUS91 91
Boy Willie and Lymon struggle with the piano.
LYMON
It’s stuck. Something holding it.
BOY WILLIE
How the piano gonna be stuck? We
just moved it. Slide you’ end out.
LYMON
How this big old piano get in the
house?
95.
96.
BOY WILLIE
I don’t know how it got in the
house. I know how it’s going out
though! You get on this end. I’ll
carry three hundred and fifty
pounds of it. All you got to do is
slide your end out. Ready?
They switch sides and try again without success. Doaker
enters from his room.
DOAKER
Boy Willie, what you doing?
LYMON
Hey Doaker...how this piano get in
the house?
BOY WILLIE
I’m carrying this piano out the
house. What it look like I’m
doing? Come on, Lymon, let’s try
again.
DOAKER
Go on let the piano sit there till
Berniece come home.
BOY WILLIE
I done called that white man about
the piano. You ain’t got nothing
to do with this, Doaker. This my
business.
DOAKER
This is my house, nigger! I ain’t
gonna let you or nobody else carry
nothing out of it. You ain’t gonna
carry nothing out of here without
my permission!
BOY WILLIE
This is my piano. I don’t need
your permission to carry my
belongings out of your house. This
is mine.
DOAKER
I say leave it over there till
Berniece come home. She got part
of it too. Leave it set there till
you see what she say.
96.
(MORE)
97.
BOY WILLIE
I don’t care what Berniece say.
Come on, Lymon. I got this side.
DOAKER
Go on and cut it half in two if you
want to. Just leave Berniece’s
half sitting over there. I can’t
tell you what to do with your
piano. But I can’t let you take
her half out of here.
BOY WILLIE
Go on, Doaker. You ain’t got
nothing to do with this. I don’t
want you starting nothing now.
Just go on and leave me alone.
Come on, Lymon. I got this end.
STAY WITH Doaker as he goes into his room, opens a drawer and
pulls out a REVOLVER.
In the Parlor Boy Willie and Lymon prepare to move the piano.
LYMON
How we gonna get it in the truck?
BOY WILLIE
Don’t worry about how we gonna get
it on the truck. You got to get it
out the house first.
LYMON
It’s gonna take more than me and
you to move this piano.
BOY WILLIE
Just lift up on that end, nigger!
Doaker comes to the doorway of his room and stands with the
gun at his side.
DOAKER
(quietly with authority)
Leave that piano set over there
till Berniece come back. I don’t
care what you do with it then. But
you gonna leave it sit over there
right now.
BOY WILLIE
Alright...I’m gonna tell you this,
Doaker. (MORE)

BOY WILLIE (CONT'D)
98.
I’m going out of here...I’m gonna
get me some rope...find me a plank
and some wheels...and I’m coming
back. Then I’m gonna carry that
piano out of here...sell it and
give Berniece half the money.
See...now that’s what I’m gonna do.
And you...or nobody else is gonna
stop me. Come on, Lymon...let’s go
get some rope and stuff. I’ll be
back, Doaker.
Boy Willie and Lymon exit.

We ride in the back of the empty truck as it bounces on
uneven road. We see the city alive -- a rare combination of
urban sprawl and nature.

CLOSE ON THE PIANO as SUNLIGHT moves across the ancestors.
MARETHA (O.S.)
Anybody ever see the Ghosts?
ON Maretha as she spins a CASTER. Boy Willie gently takes it
from her and screws it into a wooden plank. The sun will set
throughout the scene and eventually it turns to night.
BOY WILLIE
They like the wind. Can you see
the wind?
MARETHA
No.
BOY WILLIE
You can’t see them. But sometimes
you be in trouble they might be
around to help you. They say if
you go where the Southern cross the
Yellow Dog...you go where them two
railroads cross each other...and
call out their names...they say
they talk back to you. I don’t
know, I ain’t never done that. But
Uncle Wining Boy he say he been
down there and talked to them.
Maretha takes that in, spooked. Then she JUMPS when Berniece
enters from the front door.

BOY WILLIE (CONT'D)
You have to ask him about that
part.
BERNIECE
Maretha, you go on and get ready
for me to do your hair. Go on.
MARETHA
Mama, all the hair grease is gone.
Berniece gives her a dollar.
BERNIECE
Here...run across the street and
get another can. You come straight
back, too. Don’t be playing around
out there. And watch the cars. Be
careful when you cross the street.
Maretha exits out the front door.
BERNIECE (CONT'D)
Boy Willie, I done told you to
leave my house.
BOY WILLIE
I ain’t in you’ house. I’m in
Doaker’s house. If he ask me to
leave then I’ll go on and leave.
But consider me done left your
part.
BERNIECE
Doaker, tell him to leave. Tell
him to go on.
DOAKER
Boy Willie ain’t done nothing for
me to put him out of the house. I
told you if you can’t get along
just go on and don’t have nothing
to do with each other.
BOY WILLIE
I ain’t thinking about Berniece.
Boy Willie draws a line across the floor with his foot.
BOY WILLIE (CONT'D)
There! Now I’m out of your part of
the house. Consider me done left
your part. (MORE)

Soon as Lymon come back with that
rope, I’m gonna take that piano out
of here and sell it.
BERNIECE
You ain’t gonna touch that piano.
BOY WILLIE
Carry it out of here just as big
and bold. Do like my daddy would
have done come time to get Sutter’s
land.
BERNIECE
I got something to make you leave
it over there.
BOY WILLIE
It’s got to come better than this
thirty-two-twenty.
DOAKER
Why don’t you stop all that! Boy
Willie, go on and leave her alone.
You know how Berniece get. Why you
wanna sit there and pick with her?
BOY WILLIE
I ain’t picking with her. I told
her the truth. She the one talking
about what she got. I just told
her what she better have.
BERNIECE
That’s alright, Doaker. Leave him
alone.
BOY WILLIE
She trying to scare me. Hell, I
ain’t scared of dying. I look
around and see people dying every
day. You got to die to make room
for somebody else. I had a dog
that died. Wasn’t nothing but a
puppy. I picked it up and put it
in a bag and carried it up there to
Reverend C.L. Thompson’s church. I
carried it up there and prayed and
asked Jesus to make it live like he
did the man in the Bible. I prayed
real hard. Knelt down and
everything. Say ask in Jesus’
name. Well, I must have called
Jesus’ name two hundred times.

101.
I called his name till my mouth got
sore. I got up and looked in the
bag and the dog still dead. It
ain’t moved a muscle! I say,
“Well, ain’t nothing precious.”
And then I went out and killed me a
cat. That’s when I discovered the
power of death. See, a nigger that
ain’t afraid to die is the worse
kind of nigger for the white man.
He can’t hold that power over you.
That’s what I learned when I killed
that cat. I got the power of death
too. I can command him. I can
call him up. The white man don’t
like to see that. He don’t like
for you to stand up and look him
square in the eye and say, “I got
it too.” Then he got to deal with
you square up.
BERNIECE
That’s why I don’t talk to him,
Doaker. You try and talk to him
and that’s the only kind of stuff
that comes out his mouth.
DOAKER
You say Avery went home to get his
Bible?
BOY WILLIE
What Avery gonna do? Avery can’t
do nothing with me. I wish Avery
would say something to me about
this piano.
DOAKER
Berniece ain’t said about that. He
coming by to bless the house see if
he can get rid of Sutter’s ghost.
Maretha enters through the front door.
BOY WILLIE
Ain’t nothing but a house full of
ghosts down there at the church.
What Avery look like chasing away
somebody’s ghost?
BERNIECE
(to Maretha)
Light that stove and set that comb
over there to get hot.
BOY WILLIE (CONT'D)
(MORE)
101.
BERNIECE (CONT'D)
102.
Get something to put around your
shoulders.
Maretha obliges.
BOY WILLIE
The Bible say an eye for an eye, a
tooth for a tooth, and a life for a
life. Tit for tat. But you and
Avery don’t want to believe that.
You gonna pass up that part and
pretend it ain’t in there.
Everything else you gonna agree
with. But if you gonna agree with
part of it you got to agree with
all of it. You can’t do nothing
halfway. Ask Avery. He a
preacher. He’ll tell you it’s in
there. He the Good Shepherd.
Unless he gonna shepherd you to
heaven with half the Bible.
BERNIECE
Maretha, bring me that comb. Make
sure it’s hot.
The comb is smoking. Maretha brings it to her then sits at
her feet.
BOY WILLIE
I will say this for Avery. He done
figured out a path to go through
life. I don’t agree with it but he
done fixed it so he can go right
through it real smooth. Hell, he
liable to end up with a million
dollars that he done got from
selling bread and wine.
Berniece roughly fingers through Maretha’s tender head.
MARETHA
OWWWWWW!
BERNIECE
Be still, Maretha. If you was a
boy I wouldn’t be going through
this.
BOY WILLIE
Don’t you tell that girl that. Why
you wanna tell her that?
BERNIECE (CONT'D)
102.
(MORE)
103.
BERNIECE
You ain’t got nothing to do with
this child.
BOY WILLIE
Telling her you wish she was a boy.
How’s that gonna make her feel?
BERNIECE
Boy Willie, go on and leave me
alone.
DOAKER
Why don’t you leave her alone?
What you got to pick with her for?
Why don’t you go on out and see
what’s out there in the streets?
Have something to tell the fellows
down home.
BOY WILLIE
I’m waiting on Lymon to get back
with that truck. Why don’t you go
out and see what’s out there in the
streets? You ain’t got work
tomorrow. Talking about me...
DOAKER
I got to stay around here and keep
you all from killing one another.
BOY WILLIE
You ain’t got to worry about me.
You ought to be talking to
Berniece. Sitting up there telling
Maretha she wished she was a boy.
What kind of thing is that to tell
a child? If you want to tell her
something tell her about that
piano. You ain’t even told her
about that piano. Like that’s
something to be ashamed of.
BERNIECE
Let me take care of my child. When
you get one of your own then you
can teach it what you want to teach
it.
Doaker exits into his room.
BOY WILLIE
What I want to bring a child into
this world for?
(MORE)

BOY WILLIE (CONT'D)
(MORE)
104.
Why I wanna bring somebody else
into all this for? I’ll tell you
this...if I was Rockefeller I’d
have forty or fifty. I’d make one
everyday. ‘Cause they gonna start
out in life with all the
advantages. I ain’t got no
advantages to offer nobody. Many
is the time I looked at my daddy
and seen him staring off at his
hands. I got a little older I know
what he was thinking. He sitting
there saying, “I got these big old
hands but what I’m gonna do with
them? Best I can do is make a
fifty-acre crop for Mr. Stovall.
Got these big old hands capable of
doing anything. I can take and
build something with these hands.
But where’s the tools? All I got
is these hands. Unless I go out
here and kill me somebody and take
what they got...it’s a long road to
hoe for me to get something of my
own. So what I’m gonna do with
these big old hands? What would
you do?” See now...if he had his
own land he wouldn’t have felt that
way. If he had something under his
feet that belong to him he could
stand up taller. That’s what I’m
talking about. Ain’t no mystery to
life. You just got to go out and
meet it square on. If you teach
that girl that she living at the
bottom of life, she’s gonna grow up
and hate you.
BERNIECE
I’m gonna teach her the truth.
That’s just where she living. Only
she ain’t got to stay there.
(to Maretha)
Turn your head over to the other
side.
BOY WILLIE
This might be your bottom but it
ain’t mine. I’m living at the top
of life. I ain’t gonna just take
my life and throw it away at the
bottom. I’m in the world like
everybody else.
BOY WILLIE (CONT'D)

105.
The way I see it everybody else got
to come up a little taste to be
where I am.
BERNIECE
You right at the bottom with the
rest of us.
BOY WILLIE
If you believe that’s where you at
then you gonna act that way. If
you act that way then that’s where
you gonna be.
Doaker enters from his room.
BOY WILLIE (CONT'D)
Hey, Doaker...Berniece say the
colored folks is living at the
bottom of life. You think you
living at the bottom of life? Is
that how you see yourself?
DOAKER
I’m just living the best way I know
how. I ain’t thinking about no top
or no bottom.
BOY WILLIE
That’s what I tried to tell
Berniece. I don’t know where she
got that from. That sound like
something Avery would say. Avery
think ‘cause the white man give him
a turkey for Thanksgiving that
makes him better than everybody
else. That’s gonna raise him out
of the bottom of life. I don’t
need nobody to give me a turkey. I
can get my own turkey. All you
have to do is get out my way. I’ll
get me two or three turkeys.
BERNIECE
You can’t even get a chicken let
alone two or three turkeys.
Talking about get out your way.
Ain’t nobody in your way.
(to Maretha)
Straighten your head, Maretha!
Don’t be bending down like that.
Hold your head up!
(to Boy Willie)
All you got going for you is talk.
BOY WILLIE (CONT'D)
(MORE)
105.
BERNIECE (CONT'D)
106.
You’ whole life that’s all you ever
had going for you.
BOY WILLIE
See now...I’ll tell you something
about me. I done strung along and
strung along. Going this way and
that. Whatever way would lead me
to a moment of peace. That’s all I
want. To be easy with everything.
But I wasn’t born to that. I was
born to a time of fire. The world
ain’t wanted no part of me. I
could see that since I was about
seven. The world say it’s better
off without me. See, Berniece
accept that. She trying to come up
to where she can prove something to
the world. Hell, the world a
better place ‘cause of me. I don’t
see it like Berniece. I got a
heart that beats here and it beats
just as loud as the next fellow’s.
Don’t care if he black or white.
Sometime it beats louder. When it
beats louder, then everybody can
hear it. Some people get scared of
that. Like Berniece. Some people
get scared to hear a nigger’s heart
beating. They think you ought to
lay low with that heart. Make it
beat quiet and go along with
everything the way it is. But my
mama ain’t birthed me for nothing.
So what I got to do? I got to mark
my passing on the road. Just like
you write on a tree, “Boy Willie
was here.” That’s all I’m trying
to do with that piano. Trying to
put my mark on the road. Like my
daddy done. My heart say for me to
sell that piano and get me some
land so I can make a life for
myself to live in my own way.
Other than that I ain’t thinking
about nothing Berniece got to say.
There’s a KNOCK at the door. Boy Willie crosses to it and
yanks it open thinking it is Lymon. Avery enters. He
carries a Bible.
BERNIECE (CONT'D)
106.
107.
BOY WILLIE (CONT'D)
Where you been, nigger? Aw...I
thought you was Lymon. Hey,
Berniece, look who’s here.
BERNIECE
Come on in, Avery. Don’t you pay
Boy Willie no mind.
BOY WILLIE
Hey...hey Avery...tell me
this...can you get to heaven with
half the Bible?
BERNIECE
Boy Willie...I done told you to
leave me alone.
BOY WILLIE
I just ask the man a question. He
can answer. He don’t need you to
speak for him. Avery...if you only
believe on half the Bible and you
don’t want to accept the other
half...you think God let you in
heaven?
AVERY
You got to be born again. Jesus
say “Unless a man be born again he
cannot come unto the Father and who
so ever heareth my words and
believeth them not shall be cast
into a fiery pit.”
BOY WILLIE
That’s what I was trying to tell
Berniece. You got to believe in it
all. You can’t go at nothing
halfway. She think she going to
heaven with half the Bible.
(to Berniece)
You hear that...Jesus say you got
to believe in it all.
BERNIECE
You keep messing with me.
BOY WILLIE
I ain’t thinking about you.
107.
108.
DOAKER
Come on in, Avery, and have a seat.
Don’t pay neither one of them no
mind. They been arguing all day.
BERNIECE
(to Maretha)
Here, set this comb back over there
on that stove.
(to Avery)
Don’t pay Boy Willie no mind. He
been around here bothering me since
I come home from work.
BOY WILLIE
Boy Willie ain’t bothering you.
Boy Willie ain’t bothering nobody.
I’m just waiting on Lymon to get
back. I ain’t thinking about you.
DOAKER
What they say down there at the
bank, Avery?
AVERY
Oh, they talked to me real nice. I
told Berniece...they say maybe they
let me borrow the money. They done
talked to my boss down at work and
everything.
DOAKER
That’s what I told Berniece. You
working every day you ought to be
able to borrow some money.
AVERY
I’m getting more people in my
congregation every day. Berniece
says she gonna be the Deaconess. I
get me my church I can get married
and settled down. That’s what I
told Berniece.
DOAKER
That be nice. You ought to go
ahead and get married. Berniece
don’t need to be by herself. I
tell her that all the time.
BERNIECE
I ain’t said nothing about getting
married. I said I was thinking
about it.
108.
(MORE)
109.
DOAKER
Avery get him his church you all
can make it nice.
(to Avery)
Berniece said you was coming by to
bless the house.
AVERY
Yeah, I done read up on my Bible.
She asked me to come by and see if
I can get rid of Sutter’s ghost.
BOY WILLIE
Ain’t no ghost in this house.
That’s all in Berniece’s head.
DOAKER
Well, let her find that out then.
If Avery blessing the house is
gonna make her feel better...what
you got to do with it?
AVERY
Berniece say Maretha seen him too.
I don’t know, but I found a part in
the Bible to bless the house. If
he is here then that ought to make
him go.
BOY WILLIE
You worse than Berniece believing
all that stuff. Talking about...if
he here. Go on up there and find
out. I been up there I ain’t seen
him. If you reading from that
Bible gonna make him leave out of
Berniece imagination, well, you
might be right. But if you talking
about -
DOAKER
Boy Willie, why don’t you just be
quiet? Getting all up in the man’s
business. This ain’t got nothing
to do with you. Let him go ahead
and do what he gonna do.
BOY WILLIE
I ain’t stopping him. Avery ain’t
got no power to do nothing.
AVERY
Oh, I ain’t got no power. God got
the power! (MORE)
109.
AVERY (CONT'D)
110.
God got power over everything in
his creation. God can do anything.
God say, “As I commandeth so it
shall be.” God said, “Let there be
light,” and there was light. He
made the world in six days and
rested on the seventh. God’s got a
wonderful power. He got power over
life and death. I ain’t worried
about him chasing away a little old
ghost!
There is a KNOCK at the door. Boy Willie goes to answer it.
Lymon enters carrying a coil of rope.
BOY WILLIE
Where you been? I been waiting on
you and you run off somewhere.
LYMON
I ran into Grace. Hi, Berniece.
BOY WILLIE
Give me that rope and get up on
this side of the piano.
DOAKER
Boy Willie, don’t start nothing
now. Leave the piano alone.
BOY WILLIE
Get the board there, Lymon. Stay
out of this, Doaker.
Berniece exits up the stairs.
DOAKER
You just can’t take the piano. How
you gonna take the piano? Berniece
ain’t said nothing about selling
that piano.
BOY WILLIE
She ain’t got to say nothing. Come
on, Lymon. We got to lift one end
at a time up on the board.
LYMON
What we gonna do with the rope?
BOY WILLIE
Let me worry about the rope. You
just get up on this side over here
with me.
AVERY (CONT'D)
110.
111.
Berniece enters from the stairs with Crawley’s REVOLVER.
AVERY
Boy Willie...Berniece...why don’t
you all sit down and talk this out
now?
BERNIECE
Ain’t nothing to talk out.
BOY WILLIE
I’m through talking to Berniece.
Get up on that side, Lymon.
LYMON
Wait a minute...wait a minute, Boy
Willie. Berniece got to say. Hey,
Berniece...did you tell Boy Willie
he could take this piano?
BERNIECE
Boy Willie ain’t taking nothing out
of my house but himself. Now you
let him go ahead and try.
BOY WILLIE
Come on, Lymon, get up on this side
with me... Come on, nigger! What
you standing there for?
LYMON
Maybe Berniece is right. Maybe you
shouldn’t sell it.
AVERY
You all ought to sit down and talk
it out. See if you can come to an
agreement.
DOAKER
That’s what I been trying to tell
them. Seem like one of them ought
to respect the other one’s wishes.
BERNIECE
I wish Boy Willie would go on and
leave my house. That’s what I
wish. Now, he can respect that.
(pointing the revolver)
‘Cause he’s leaving one way or
another.
111.
112.
BOY WILLIE
What you mean one way or another?
What’s that supposed to mean? I
ain’t scared of no gun.
DOAKER
Come on, Berniece, leave him alone
with that.
BOY WILLIE
I don’t care what Berniece say.
I’m selling my half. I can’t help
it if her half got to go along with
it. It ain’t like I’m trying to
cheat her out of her half. Come
on, Lymon.
LYMON
Berniece...I got to do this...Boy
Willie say he gonna give you half
of the money.
BERNIECE
Go on, Lymon. Just go on...I done
told Boy Willie what to do.
BOY WILLIE
Here, Lymon...put that rope up over
there.
LYMON
You sure you want to do this? The
way I figure it...I might be
wrong...but I figure she gonna
shoot you first.
BOY WILLIE
She just gonna have to shoot me.
BERNIECE
Maretha, get on out the way. Get
her out the way, Doaker.
DOAKER
Go on, do what your mama told you.
Doaker ushers Maretha to his room and shuts the door. Boy
Willie and Lymon try to lift the piano. The FRONT DOOR OPENS
and Wining Boy enters. He has been drinking.
112.
113.
WINING BOY
Man, these niggers around here! I
stopped down there at
Seefus...those folks jumping back
and getting off the sidewalk
talking about Patchneck Red is
coming. Come to find out...you know
who they was talking about? Old
John D. From up around Tyler! He
got everybody scared of him.
Calling him Patchneck Red. They
don’t know I whupped the nigger’s
head in one time.
BOY WILLIE
Just make sure that board don’t
slide, Lymon.
WINING BOY
Hey, Boy Willie, what you got? I
know you got a pint stuck up in
your coat.
BOY WILLIE
Wining Boy, get out the way!
WINING BOY
Hey, Doaker. What you got? Gimme
a drink. I want a drink.
DOAKER
It look like you had enough of
whatever it was. Come talking
about, “What you got?” You ought
to be trying to find somewhere to
lay down.
WINING BOY
I ain’t worried about no place to
lay down. I can always find me a
place to lay down in Berniece’s
house. Ain’t that right, Berniece?
BERNIECE
Wining Boy, sit down somewhere.
You been out there drinking all
day. Come in here smelling like an
old polecat.
DOAKER
You know Berniece don’t like all
that drinking.
113.
114.
WINING BOY
I ain’t disrespecting Berniece.
Berniece, am I disrespecting you?
I’m just trying to be nice. I been
with strangers all day and they
treated me like family. I come in
here to family and you treat me
like a stranger. I don’t need your
whiskey. I can buy my own. I
wanted your company, not your
whiskey.
DOAKER
Nigger, why don’t you go upstairs
and lay down?
WINING BOY
I ain’t thinking about no laying
down. Me and Boy Willie fixing to
party. Ain’t that right, Boy
Willie? Tell him. I’m fixing to
play me some piano. Watch this.
Wining Boy sits down at the piano.
BOY WILLIE
Come on, Wining Boy! Me and Lymon
fixing to move the piano.
WINING BOY
Naw...naw...you ain’t gonna move
this piano!
BOY WILLIE
Get out the way, Wining Boy.
Wining Boy spreads his arms out over the piano.
WINING BOY
You ain’t taking this piano out the
house. You got to take me with it.
BOY WILLIE
Get out the way, Wining Boy!
Doaker, get him!
WINING BOY
Wait a minute...wait a minute.
This a song I wrote for Cleotha. I
wrote this song in her memory.
Wining Boy begins to play and sing.

WINING BOY (CONT'D)
Hey little woman what’s the matter
with you now/Had a storm last night
and blowed the line all down/Tell
me how long/Is I got to wait/Can I
get it now/Or must I hesitate
PUSH IN on a carving of an ANCESTOR.
INT. CHARLES HOUSE/DOAKER'S ROOM - SIMULTANEOUS94 94
PUSH IN on Maretha as she gets a chill and looks over her
shoulder -- she’s not alone in here. We hear Wining Boy
singing in the next room.
WINING BOY (O.S.)
It takes a hesitating stocking in
her hesitating shoe/It takes a
hesitating woman wanna sing the
blues/Tell me how long/Is I got to
wait
INT. CHARLES HOUSE/KITCHEN/PARLOR - SIMULTANEOUS95 95
WINING BOY
Can I kiss you now/Or must I
hesitate.
Wining Boy STOPS when they all get a CHILL.
WINING BOY (CONT'D)
Hey, Doaker, did you feel that?
Hey, Berniece...did you get cold?
Hey, Doaker...
DOAKER
What you calling me for?
WINING BOY
I believe that’s Sutter.
BERNIECE
Avery, go on and bless the house.
DOAKER
You need to bless that piano.
That’s what you need to bless. It
ain’t done nothing but cause
trouble. If you gonna bless
anything go on and bless that.
WINING BOY
Hey Doaker, if he gonna bless
something let him bless everything.

The kitchen...the upstairs. Go on
and bless it all.
BOY WILLIE
Ain’t no ghost in this house. He
need to bless Berniece’s head.
That’s what he need to bless.
AVERY
Seem like that piano’s causing all
the trouble. I can bless that.
Berniece, put me some water in that
bottle.
Avery takes a small bottle from his pocket and hands it to
Berniece, who goes into the kitchen to get water. Avery
takes a candle from his pocket and lights it. He gives it to
Berniece as she gives him the water.
AVERY (CONT'D)
Hold this candle. Whatever you do
make sure it don’t go out. O Holy
Father we gather here this evening
in the Holy Name to cast out the
spirit of one James Sutter. May
this vial of water be empowered
with thy spirit. May each drop of
it be a weapon and a shield against
the presence of all evil and may it
be a cleansing and blessing of this
humble abode. Where there is Good
so shall it cause Evil to scatter
to the Four Winds. Get thee behind
me, Satan! Get thee behind the
face of Righteousness as we Glorify
His Holy Name!
Avery throws water on the piano and the LIGHTS FLICKER.
INT. CHARLES HOUSE/DOAKER'S ROOM - SIMULTANEOUS96 96
Maretha reacts to the flickering lights, scared.
INT. CHARLES HOUSE/KITCHEN/PARLOR - SIMULTANEOUS97 97
AVERY
Get thee behind the Hammer of Truth
that breaketh down the Wall of
Falsehood! Father. Father.
Praise. Praise. We ask in Jesus’
name and call forth the power of
the Holy Spirit as it is written...

“I will sprinkle clean water upon
thee and ye shall be clean.”
BOY WILLIE
All this old preaching stuff.
Hell, just tell him to leave.
Avery continues reading throughout Boy Willie’s outburst.
AVERY
“I will sprinkle clean water upon
you and you shall be clean: from
all your uncleanliness, and from
all your idols, will I cleanse you.
Boy Willie grabs a pot of water from the stove and flings it
around the room. As he does, the LIGHTS TURN OFF AND ON.
BOY WILLIE
Hey Sutter! Sutter! Get your ass
out this house! Come on and get
some of this water! You done
drowned in the well, come on and
get you some more of this water!
Boy Willie works himself into a frenzy as he runs around
throwing water and calling Sutter’s name. Avery continues:
BOY WILLIE (CONT'D)
Come on, Sutter! Get some water!
As Boy Willie moves up the stairs he is suddenly THROWN BACK
by some powerful unseen force. He lands hard but gets right
back up, a believer now. He heads back up the stairs:
BOY WILLIE (CONT'D)
Come on, Sutter!
INT. CHARLES HOUSE/DOAKER'S ROOM/PARLOR - SIMULTANEOUS98 98
A lightbulb explodes. Maretha hustles to the door and opens
it. Lymon sees her terror and scoops her up, protective.
AVERY
(reading the Bible)
“A new heart also will I give you
and a new spirit will I put within
you: and I will take out of your
flesh the heart of stone, and I
will give you a heart of flesh.
And I will put my spirit within
you, and cause you to walk in my
statutes, and ye shall keep my
judgements, and do them.”

INT. CHARLES HOUSE/UPSTAIRS HALLWAY/BATHROOM - SIMULTANEOUS99 99
The lights continue to go on and off.
BOY WILLIE
Come on, Sutter! I’m right here.
Suddenly Boy Willie gets punched in the face and knocked to
the ground. He wrestles with the invisible spirit. In the
brief moments of darkness, when the lights GO OFF we
MOMENTARILY SEE SUTTER in all his rotting, ghostly rage.
When the lights GO BACK ON he is unseen again.
The struggle tumbles into the bathroom. Boy Willie throws
punches at the air. Then he gets knocked down again.
Suddenly, the faucet EXPLODES AND SPEWS WATER.
The struggle continues and Boy Willie gets drenched. Then
suddenly Sutter drags him out of frame.
INT. CHARLES HOUSE/KITCHEN/PARLOR - SIMULTANEOUS100 100
As the LIGHTS STROBE, we catch glimpses of Sutter dragging
Boy Willie back down the stairs by his leg. Doaker and
Wining Boy stare at each other in stunned disbelief.
Berniece clutches the candle as Lymon comforts Maretha.
Boy Willie is lifted off the ground, slammed into a wall and
pinned, his feet dangling. Sutter chokes him.
We see Sutter’s decomposed hand wrapped around Boy Willie’s
throat. Boy Willie struggles for breath. A gust of wind
BLOWS OUT BERNIECE’S CANDLE.
AVERY
Berniece, I can’t do it.
Sutter’s grip gets tighter. Boy Willie is on the brink of
death. He looks to Berniece, his eyes pleading for help.
It is in this moment, from somewhere old, that Berniece
realizes what she must do. She sets down her candle and
crosses to the piano. She begins to play. The song is found
piece by piece. With each repetition it gains in strength.
BERNIECE
I want you to help me/I want you to
help me/I want you to help me/Mama
Berniece/I want you to help me
We see the carving of MAMA BERNIECE, arms outstretched.

BERNIECE (CONT'D)
Mama Esther/I want you to help me
We see the carving of MAMA ESTHER.
BERNIECE (CONT'D)
Papa Boy Charles/I want you to help

We see the carving of Papa Boy Charles.
BERNIECE (CONT'D)
Mama Ola/I want you to help me/I

The STROBE INTENSIFIES and we see the ANCESTORS APPEAR NEXT
TO HER. They move to Boy Willie and Sutter weakens. The
sound of a TRAIN APPROACHING IS HEARD. Wind blows. Plates
fly out of the cupboard and shatter.
Suddenly, SUTTER’S HEAD CATCHES FIRE. The FLAME ON
BERNIECE’S CANDLE RE-IGNITES. And Boy Willie is released and
drops to the ground. And, just as quickly as it started, the
tempest STOPS. Sutter and the Ancestors are gone.
BOY WILLIE
Come on, Sutter! Come back!
BERNIECE
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
Boy Willie drags himself to his feet. Then:
BOY WILLIE
Wining Boy, you ready to go back
down home?
DOAKER
You still got time to make the
train.
Boy Willie looks to his sister, grateful. Then they move to
each other and embrace.
BOY WILLIE
If you and Maretha don’t keep
playing on that piano...ain’t no
telling...me and Sutter both liable
to be back.
BERNIECE
Thank you... Thank you...

EXT. FIELD - DAY101 101
Birds chirp. Insects thrum. A long beat as CAMERA SETTLES
ON Boy Willie, alone and staring out at... SUTTER’S HOUSE
sitting on a wide expanse of SUTTER’S LAND.
Boy Willie ponders what could have been. He bends and grabs
a handful of dirt. Then he loosens his fist and lets the
dirt go. Then he turns, gets into a new (old) truck and
drives off. SOMEWHERE A PIANO PLAYS. Something basic and
littered with mistakes. We hear Berniece laughing and
playful:
BERNIECE (V.O.)
Girl, stop banging on that piano.
MARETHA (V.O.)
I’m practicing.
INT. CHARLES HOUSE PARLOR - DAY102 102
Berniece and Maretha sit side by side on piano. Smiling,
laughing.
BERNIECE
Well then play it. You got to feel
it.
MARETHA
Like this?
Maretha plays the BOOGIE WOOGIE Boy Willie showed her.
Berniece is surprised.
BERNIECE
Where you learn that?
Their laughter takes us to...
INT. BOY WILLIE’S TRUCK - DAWN103 103
Boy Willie drives away with a newfound peace. He passes a FOR
SALE sign and glances in the rear view mirror, one last look
at Sutter’s Land. It shrinks in the distance.

121.
Off the truck driving towards the rising sun and a new day...
FADE OUT.
