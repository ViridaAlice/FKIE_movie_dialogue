FADE IN:
EXT. APARTMENT BLOCK - ROME - NIGHT1 1
A large, modern apartment block in a modest part of the city.
The streets are quiet. Everyone sleeps.
INT. APARTMENT - ROME - NIGHT2 2
CLOSE on a WINDOW PANE, small, leaded. We HOLD on the glass,
nothing but black night outside, not sure what we’re supposed
to be looking at.
Then, with a sharp ping, the pane cracks.
ON A SLEEPING MAN, his back to us. Woken by the sound, the
man raises his head from the pillow, stares at the cracked
pane.
Silence.
The sudden jangle of a phone in the room. The man turns his
head to stare at the phone.
EXT. TUNNEL NEAR VATICAN - ROME - NIGHT3 3
CLOSE - PUSHING the MAN as he walks quickly through a tunnel,
his sleep-whorled hair standing in undignified tufts from the
back of his head. A lone car passes.
EXT. STREET NEAR VATICAN - ROME - NIGHT3A 3A
The MAN continues to rush through the empty streets. The only
sound is his heavy breathing and footsteps. Ahe ad of him a
blue light pulses in SOFT FOCUS against the vague bulk of St
Peter’s.
I/E. SHOP - STREET NEAR VATICAN - NIGHT3B 3B
Outside on the street the MAN passes a SHOP WINDOW and for a
moment we hold on the display - rows of PLASTIC PIETÀS.

INT. CASA SANTA MARTA - LIFT PAPAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT6 6
In the lift the MAN - CARDINAL LAWRENCE - stares down at his
hand and realises he is clutching his red zucchetto. We are
still on his back as he smoothes down his hair and puts it on
his head. Then he turns to the mirror and we see his face for
the first time: careworn, anonymous. An administrator.
Lawrence glances at his ashen reflection in the mirrored
walls, looks away. The elevator arrives. Lawrence raises his
chin, prepares his public face. The doors slide open to
reveal a solid wall of MEN IN BLACK SUITS.
INT. CASA SANTA MARTA - PAPAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT7 7
The wall of SECURITY parts with difficulty and he makes his
way through them towards the Papal Suite. White marbled
floors. It could be a hotel, a clinic.
ARCHBISHOP WOZNIAK, built like a labourer, eyes, behind his
glasses, red from crying, comes to meet him.
ARCHBISHOP WOZNIAK
(Helplessly)
Eminence...
Lawrence takes his cheeks in his hand.
LAWRENCE
Janusz, your presence made him so
happy.
Ahead of them a BODYGUARD steps aside and Lawrence walks on
into...
INT. PAPAL SUITE - NIGHT8 8
Lawrence stops, surprised by the throng of people crowd ed
into the little living room. He realises with a faint stab of
pain, that he must have been one of the last summoned. He
follows Wozniak through the open doors into...
INT. PAPAL BEDROOM - NIGHT9 9
The room is almost shockingly plain - a chest of drawers,
nightstand, an anonymous bed that could be found in any
hotel. And lying on this bed, slightly propped up on pillows,
lies the dead Pope.
CONCLAVE by Peter Straughan - Pink Revisions. (27.01.2023) 2.
Kneeling around the bed are the three other senior cardinals
of the Catholic Church: ALDO BELLINI, JOSEPH TREMBLAY, JOSHUA
ADEYEMI.
The room is so small he has to step over the backs of their
legs to reach the head of the bed.
He stares down at the Pope, the expression of almost wry
amusement on the dead man’s face.
ADEYEMI
Subvenite, Sancti Dei...
Lawrence realises they have been waiting for him to b egin the
liturgy and hurriedly kneels, joints creaking. He glances
back at the sitting room beyond. Everyone is kneeling, head
bowed. He buries his face in his hands as the Nigerian
cardinal’s deep voice reverberates in the tiny room.
ADEYEMI (CONT’D)
... occurrite, Angeli Domini,
Suscipientes animam eius.
Offerentes eam in conspectu
Altissimi...
ALL CARDINALS
Suscipiat te Christus qui vocavit te
et in sinum Abrahae angeli deducant
te.
As the prayer continues Lawrence half-opens his eyes. His
gaze wanders around the scene before him, as if still trying
to comprehend what has happened...
...the folded spectacles on the bedside table, the scuffed
alarm clock beside them, the simple crucifix above the bed...
A heart-breaking detail: the wooden rim of the headboard is
cracked, the padded panel within, fraying...
Finally the familiar face, strangely naked without the
customary spectacles...
He realises Adeyemi has finished. The Cardinals recite the
chorus.
ALL CARDINALS (CONT’D)
Sicut erat in principio et nunc et
semper et in saecula saeculorum.
Amen.
For a few moments the room is completely still. Then...
CONCLAVE by Peter Straughan - Pink Revisions. (27.01.2023) 3.
TREMBLAY
He is with God.
The Canadian Tremblay, Carmerlengo or Chamberlain - silver
hair immaculately coiffed, the trim build of a retired
athlete - stretches out his arms as if in blessing. Two
ASSISTANTS hurry forward and help him up. Lawrence rises
creakily to his feet with the other Cardinals.
TREMBLAY (CONT’D)
Archbishop Wozniak.
Wozniak edges around the bed and, sweating with
embarrassment, struggles to pull a RING from the Pope’s hand.
Finally he works it free and presents it to Tremblay who
produces a pair of shears from a silver box. Grimacing with
effort he cuts free the metal disc of St Peter from the ring.
The snap is audible in the silent room.
TREMBLAY (CONT’D)
Sede vacante. The throne of the
Holy See is vacant.
INT. PAPAL SUITE - NIGHT10 10
Groups of dignitaries stand in whispered conference. Lawrence
gingerly works his way through the throng to a lone figure
standing by the desk: the lean, ascetic frame of his friend,
Cardinal Bellini, Secretary of State.
LAWRENCE
(Joining him)
Aldo...
Bellini is staring down at a little plastic travel CHESS SET
on the desk - almost the only personal item in the bland
room. He brushes the pieces, grouped mid-game, with a finger.
BELLINI
Do you think anyone would m ind if I
took this, Thomas? As a keepsake?
LAWRENCE
Of course. Take it. He would have
wanted you to have it.
BELLINI
We used to play quite often at the
end of the day. He said it helped
him relax.
LAWRENCE
Who won?
CONCLAVE by Peter Straughan - Pink Revisions. (27.01.2023) 4.
BELLINI
Oh, he did. Always eight moves
ahead.
His eyes suddenly fill with tears. Moved, Lawrence takes his
arm.
LAWRENCE
Ah, Aldo, I’m so sorry. What
happened, do you know?
BELLINI
They say heart attack. There had
been warnings.
Lawrence blinks in surprise.
LAWRENCE
I hadn’t heard that.
BELLINI
He didn’t want anyone to know. He
thought if word got out they would
start spreading rumours he was
going to resig n.
Lawrence is trying not to show his hurt at being excluded.
Bellini mistakes his silence for puzzlement.
BELLINI (CONT’D)
(Quietly)
The Curia.
Lawrence nods, rouses himself to action. Tremblay, across the
room, is watching.
LAWRENCE
We’ll have to be careful what we
say to the media about his
condition.
INT. PAPAL SUITE - SITTING ROOM - NIGHT10A 10A
Lawrence and Bellini find Wozniak sitting alone in the dark.
Lawren ce addresses him gently.
LAWRENCE
Janusz, I know this is hard for
you, but we’ll need to prepare a
detailed statement. Who discovered
the Holy Father’s body?
CONCLAVE by Peter Straughan - Pink Revisions. (27.01.2023) 5.
ARCHBISHOP WOZNIAK
I did, Your Eminence.
LAWRENCE
Well, thank God, that’s something.
What did you do?
ARCHBISHOP WOZNIAK
I called the Holy Father’s doctor.
He always spent the night in the
room next door. But... it was too
late.
LAWRENCE
What time was this?
ARCHBISHOP WOZNIAK
Around eleven thirty, Eminence.
(Off Thomas' surprise)
I would have called you sooner,
but...
Wozniak shrugs helplessly. Tremblay arriv es just in time at
the door.
TREMBLAY
Thomas, I’m so sorry. I know His
Holiness had no closer colleagues
than you and Aldo... But I asked
Janusz to hold off calling you.
I... I wanted to ascertain all the
facts.
LAWRENCE
Well, I’m sure you acted for the
best.
TREMBLAY
(walking towards them)
The way rumours can spread. One and
a quarter billion souls watching.
He draws a document from his cassock. Belli ni sits down next
to Wozniak.
TREMBLAY (CONT’D)
I’ve prepared a time-line of His
Holiness’ last day.
Lawrence examines it. He suddenly feels the bulk of Adeyemi,
Cardinal Major Penitentiary or confessor-in-chief - at his
shoulder. Tremblay passes them more sheets.
CONCLAVE by Peter Straughan - Pink Revisions. (27.01.2023) 6.
TREMBLAY (CONT’D)
The Holy Father’s most recent
medical records. He had an
angiogram last month.
Lawrence is holding the x-ray to the light, staring in
silence, struck that he is looking at the very heart of the
man he revered.
TREMBLAY (CONT’D)
(Pointing)
You can see the evidence of a
blockage...just here.
Lawrence and Bellini share a look - a flinch of distress.
LAWRENCE
Joe, perhaps...perhaps we could
release the data, but not the
photograph? It feels too...too....
Tremblay inclines his head sympathetically.
TREMBLAY
I know, Thomas, I know. But there
will have to be an autopsy.
Adeyemi is still scanning the time-line.
ADEYEMI
The ti me before Vespers? What was
he doing then?
TREMBLAY
Routine meetings as far as I
understand it.
ADEYEMI
Who was the last to have a
scheduled meeting with him?
TREMBLAY
I believe that may have been me. I
saw him at four. Is that right
Janusz? Was I the last?
ARCHBISHOP WOZNIAK
You were, Eminence.
ADEYEMI
Put in all the meetings he had that
day. It will show how hard he was
working, right up to the end.
CONCLAVE by Peter Straughan - Pink Revisions. (27.01.2023) 7.
TREMBLAY
That might look as if we were
placing a huge burden on a sick
man.
ADEYEMI
The Papacy is a huge burden.
Especially for an older man.
Silence. A slight tension. Adeyemi is the youngest here. The
contest has begun. Lawrence breaks the awkward silence.
LAWRENCE
Has anyone telephoned Cardinal
Tedesco?
Bellini straightens and for the first time we see that
beneath the grief there is a well of anger.
LAWRENCE (CONT’D)
As a courtesy.
BELLINI
Courtesy? What has he ever done to
deserve courtesy? If anyone can be
said to have killed the Holy
Father, he did!
LAWRENCE
I have to ring him, Aldo.
INT. PAPAL OFFICE - NIGHT11 11
Lawrence st eps through the open door of the SMALL OFFICE and
dials the desk phone.
LAWRENCE
(Italian, To Operator)
< The Patriarch’s Palace in
Venice, please. Cardinal
Tedesco’s private line. >
LAWRENCE
(To Operator)
Il Palazzo Patriarcale di
Venezia, per favore. La linea
privata del cardinale
Tedesco.
After a moment.
TEDESCO (O.S.)
(Over phone)
Tedesco.
CONCLAVE by Peter Straughan - Pink Revisions. (27.01.2023) 8.
LAWRENCE
(Italian)
< Goffredo? It’s Lawrence.
I’m afraid I have terrible
news. The Holy Father has
just passed away.>
LAWRENCE
Goffredo? Sono Lawrence.
Purtroppo devo comunicarvi
una terribile notizia. Il
Santo Padre è appena
deceduto.
Lawrence listens to the phone. Silence. The sound of
movement, a door closing?
LAWRENCE (CONT’D)
(Italian)
< Your Eminence? >
LAWRENCE (CONT’D)
Eminenza?
TEDESCO (O.S.)
(Beat, Italian)
< Thank you, Lawrence. I
shall pray for his soul. >
TEDESCO (O.S.)
(Beat)
Grazie, Lawrence. Pregherò
per la sua anima.
He hangs up. The others watch from the doorway.
LAWRENCE
He already knew.
Tremblay takes out what appears to be a small leather bound
prayer book - but turns out to be a mobile phone.
BELLINI
Of course he knew. This place is
full of his supporters. He probably
knew before we did.
TREMBLAY
(Checki ng his phone)
It’s trending.
(Off the stares of the
others)
The rumours that the Pope is dead
are trending.
(A further, smiling,
explanation)
On the internet. We should move
quickly or we’ll fall behind the
news cycle.
ADEYEMI
We should wait until daylight. The
dignity of the office requires...
BELLINI
For God’s sake, Joshua. When did
the Holy Father ever care about the
“dignity of the office?” Look at
h is rooms.
CONCLAVE by Peter Straughan - Pink Revisions. (27.01.2023) 9.
TREMBLAY
The body should be embalmed.
Remember Pius XII? Went off like a
firecracker in his coffin...
Lawrence jumps slightly as Adeyemi addresses him.
ADEYEMI
Well, Dean. The responsibility for
the Conclave falls upon you.
Lawrence looks up and finds the others staring at him. The
dawning realisation of what lies ahead.
INT. PAPAL SUITE - BEDROOM - NIGHT12 12
Lawrence stands, watching WOZNIAK laying a t hin white VEIL
over the dead Pope’s face. He turns to the PRIESTS of the
Apostolic Camera, standing waiting.
LAWRENCE
(Italian)
< Seal the room. >
LAWRENCE
Sigillate la stanza.
TITLES BEGIN13 13
The Pope’s body is zipped into a a semi-transparent white
body bag and heaved onto a gurney. Lawrence watches as it is
being wheeled out into the corridor.
The sealing of the suite begins. The door is locked. Red tap e
is fixed on the frame. Wozniak is looking on.
Lawrence stands in the lift. From his place at the bottom of
the gurney, he stares fixedly down at the feet of the Pope,
ghostly through the white plastic, curled like small
foetuses.
The elevator pings and the doors slide open...
The gurney with the dead Pope is wheeled through the
UNDERGROUND GARAGE, past a puddle of oil...a crushed
cigarette pack...
T he only sound is the faint squeal of the wheels, and, the
forbidden click of phone cameras...
The sealing of the door continues - the tape criss-crossing
backwards and forwards, as if this was a crime-scene...
Wax seals bearing the coat of arms of the Cardinal Camerlengo
fix the tape ends to the frame....
CONCLAVE by Peter Straughan - Pink Revisions. (27.01.2023) 10.
Outside the body is loaded into the waiting ambulance....
The final wax seal is put in place...
...as the ambulance drives off, the dead Pope in the body bag
inside.
FADE OUT
TITLE CARD: THREE WEEKS LATER. SUNDAY, 7TH NOVEMBER, EVE OF
CONCLAVE.
FADE IN
INT/EXT. CASA SANTA MARTA - FACADE - MORNING13A 13A
WORKMEN are fitting electronic SHUTTERS over the windo ws. The
whine of power tools as screws are tightened into place.
INT. CASA SANTA MARTA - BEDROOM - MORNING13B 13B
Inside the Casa a WORKMAN tests the closing of the shutters
with a remote control. It works.
INT. CASA SANTA MARTA - CORRIDOR - MORNING13C 13C
More Workmen emerge from the bedrooms, each trundling a dolly
loaded with the TELEVISIONS being removed from the rooms.
INT. SISTINE CHAPEL - MORNING14 14
A SPIRA L PATTERN...
Intricate and beautiful. A mosaic floor. As we watch a wide
red carpet is rolled across the frame, obscuring the mosaic.
An easy-lift rises in front of the last judgement.
CLOSE ON LAWRENCE'S FACE
...looking up. As we watch, a SHADOW falls over his face.
Above him, metal panels are being fitted over the high
windows, shutting out the daylight, obscuring the ceiling in
near gloom.
Lawrence stands in the chapel, watching the sealing of the
windows unhappily.
CONCLAVE by Peter Straughan - Pink Revisions. (27.01.2023) 11.
All around him there is teeming activity. Behind him WORKMEN
hurriedly finish laying the temporary wooden floor. At the
other end of the chapel carpet is being rolled over the wood,
followed by the thunk of a nail gun.
ARCHBISHOP MANDORFF, Master of Papal Liturgical Celebrations,
(60’s, German), stands beside him, clipboard in hand.
ARCHBISHOP MANDORFF
Security say they’d like to test
the electronic jammers one last
time, your Eminence.
LAWRENCE
Then they’d better be quick.
(Of the windows)
Is this really necessary, Willi?
ARCHBISHOP MANDORFF
Apparently so. Security say...
(reading, slightly
mystified)
...eavesdroppers can use lasers to
“read the vibrations on the glass?”
LAWRENCE
Let’s hope none of our brothers
suffer from claustrophobia. Who
knows how long we’ll have to be in
here.
Lawrence stares around him at the chaos.
LAWRENCE (CONT’D)
(shouting over the racket)
I assume we are going to finish in
time?
ARCHBISHOP MANDORFF
They will work through the night if
they have to. It will be fine,
Eminence. It always is. Italy, you
know.
Lawrence nods, pats the German’s arm.
LAWRENCE
Sorry to fuss.
He walks to one of the long tables along the length of the
chapel. On it Monsignor O’ Malley and some assistants are
setting up Bible, prayer book, pens and pencils, a ballot
paper and long list of names of the 107 cardinals eligible to
vote for the next Pope.
CONCLAVE by Peter Straughan - Pink Revisions. (27.01.2023) 12.
MONSIGNOR O'MALLEY, Secretary of the College of Cardinals,
(Irish, 40’s) joins them.
MONSIGNOR O'MALLEY
Well, Eminence, I’d say this is a
pretty fair vision of hell.
LAWRENCE
Don’t be blasphemous, Ray. Hell
arrives tomorrow when we bring in
the cardinals.
He examines the list of names.
LAWRENCE (CONT’D)
(Of a name)
How on earth does one pronounce
this? Salso?
ARCHBISHOP MANDORFF
Kahl-koh, Eminence. He’s Indian.
LAWR ENCE
Kahl-koh. Thank you Willi.
He sits, testing the cushion, wondering if it will offer
comfort for the elderly men who will soon be using them.
MONSIGNOR O'MALLEY
Archbishop Wozniak has asked if he
may have a word, Eminence?
Lawrence stands again, prods the cushion.
LAWRENCE
I don’t think that’s possible. The
cardinals will begin arriving in an
hour. What’s it about?
MONSIGNOR O'MALLEY
He didn’t say. (B eat). I wouldn’t
have mentioned it but he seemed
so...upset?
Lawrence frowns at him.
LAWRENCE
We’re going to be sequestered from
six o’clock. He should have come
earlier.
MONSIGNOR O'MALLEY
Yes, your Eminence. I’ll tell him.
CONCLAVE by Peter Straughan - Pink Revisions. (27.01.2023) 13.
He starts to leave. Lawrence considers.
CONCLAVE by Peter Straughan - Pink Revisions. (27.01.2023) 13A.
LAWRENCE
Ray? Tell him I’ll see him after
I’ve met the cardinals. The poor
fellow will be worrying about his
future.
O’Malley nods and leaves.
LAWRENCE (CONT’D)
(Wryly)
Getting puffed up with my own
importance, Willi.
He holds out a hand for Mandorff to help him stand.
LAWRENCE (CONT’D)
(Rising with a wince)
The Conclave will be over in a few
days and then no-one will be
interested in me.
A DRILL starts nearby, the sound deafening in the chapel.
Lawrence winces, feels a headache coming on.
INT. SISTINE CHAPEL - ANTECHAMBER - MORNING15 15
Behind the altar of the chapel Lawrence descends a set of
stairs. He crosses a narrow sacristy to descend into a small
room.
INT. SISTINE CHAPEL - ROOM OF TEARS - MORNING15A 15A
Lawrence closes the door, muffling the sound of the work
beyond. He stands for a moment, savouring the relative pe ace.
He finds himself staring at the THRONE, on which the newly-
elected Pontiff will sit. He crosses to a clothes rail and
brushes a hand along the row of cellophane wrapped papal
cassocks.
The door opens and Bellini slips in, closing the door behind
him.
BELLINI
Shelter from the Storm.
Lawrence smiles, examines one of the cassocks.
BELLINI (CONT’D)
Dear Lord, that’s enormous.
CONCLAVE by Peter Straughan - Pink Revisions. (27.01.2023) 14.
LAWRENCE
Apparently Pope John the Twenty-
Third was too fat to fit into the
biggest cassock. They had to split
the seam in the back for him to get
into it.
He picks up a pair of shoes, slip-ons in red leather.
BELLINI
You look tired.
LAWRENCE
All this... it’s a duty I never
thought I’d have to perform.
(Beat)
I always assumed he would out-live
us all.
To his surprise he finds himself continuing....
LAWRENCE (CONT’D)
We... we didn’t part well.
He stares at the shoes to avoid Bellini’s gaze.
LAWRENCE (CONT’D)
I asked for his permission to
retire as Dean. Join an order. I
have been having... difficulties.
BELLINI
(Beat)
What did he say?
LAWRENCE
He refused my resignation. Said
that some were chosen to be
Shepherds, and some to manage the
farm. Apparently, I’m a manager.
He gives Bellini a crooked, painful smile.
LAWRENCE (CONT’D)
Things were a little cold between
us when I left. (Beat). And that
was the last time I saw him.
Bellini hesitates. Then...
BELLINI
The Holy Father told me of your...
crisis of faith. He said you had
difficulties with prayer.
CONCLAVE by Peter Straughan - Pink Revisions. (27.01.2023) 15.
Lawrence feels shocked, obscurely betrayed.
BELLINI (CONT’D)
You know that he had doubts
himself, by the end?
LAWRENCE
The Pope had doubts about God?
BELLINI
Never about God. What he had lost
faith in was the Church.
The two friends stare at each other.
I/E. MINIBUS - MORNING16 16
A group of NUNS, wearing blue habit, sit on a minibus, the
walls of the Vatican outside the window. In their midst a
woman with an arist ocratic air - SISTER AGNES.
EXT. CASA SANTA MARTA - PARKING - MORNING17 17
As the buses park inside the Vatican the NUNS descend and
walk up to the Casa.
INT. CASA SANTA MARTA - LOBBY - DAY18 18
The line of NUNS are entering the building.
INT. CASA SANTA MARTA - BACK OFFICE - DAY19 19
Sister Agnes arrives in her office. She puts down her bag and
takes off her coat, glances at the plan for the day. In the
corner a canary in a cage. Sister Agnes walks over and feeds
it.
EXT. CASA SANTA MARTA - COURTYARD - DAY20 20
Lawrence stands, wrapped in a winter coat against the cold,
on the steps of the Casa, staring up at the sky. He is
flanked again by O’Malley and Mandorff, other members of
staff hovering beside them. For a moment LAWRENCE listens to
the faint sound of thousands of voices outside on the
streets, drums echoing.
ARCHBISHOP MANDORFF
Here they come, Your Eminence.
CONCLAVE by Peter Straughan - Pink Revisions. (27.01.2023) 16.
He’s talking about the group of cardinals who are now passing
the gate into the courtyard, crossing towards him. They are
accompanied by two Security Guards, and the clatter of their
wheeled suitcases. As they approach Lawrence opens his arms.
LAWRENCE
Brothers, welcome.
CARDINAL MENDOZA
Are we criminals now? Searched?
Luggage opened...
LAWRENCE
(Taking his hands)
I’m so sorry, Your Eminence, but we
are told there is a heightened
state of security.
CARDINAL MENDOZA shows Lawrence his sleeve.
CARDINAL MENDOZA
(In disgust)
And look at this. Spat upon. The
Protestors. We’re all paedophiles
now, apparently.
(Dropping his voice)
Don Tutino?
LAWRENCE
(Quietly)
Will not be attending.
Mendoza nods grimly and walks on.
EXT. CASA SANTA MARTA - COURTYARD - LATER21 21
In MONTAGE we see further arrivals: The Africans led by the
magisterial Adeyemi, pointing out this building and that to
his party, like a proprietor. From the Eastern Ministries,
the Archbishops of Lebanon and Antioch. From India the
Archbishops of Trivandrum, Ernakulam-Angamaly and...
LAWRENCE
(Pronouncing carefully)
Eminence Khal-Koh, welcome!
Lawrence shakes his hand in the staircase.
Back in the courtyard Tremblay arrives at the same time as
the ove r-weight CARDINAL GUTTOSO. He has his choir dress in a
dry-cleaning bag slung over his shoulder, a Nike sports bag
swinging in the other. He raises both hands to indicate he
cannot shake.
CONCLAVE by Peter Straughan - Pink Revisions. (27.01.2023) 17.
TREMBLAY
Thomas!
Guttoso, in contrast has an assistant struggling behind him
with his three, huge cases. As he waddles past Lawrence and
Tremblay exchange a look.
TREMBLAY (CONT’D)
(Of the cases)
Is he smuggling in his private
Chef?
EXT. CASA SANTA MARTA - COURTYARD - AFTERNOON22 22
THE SKY -- the drone of a helicopter, either security or
media, hidden from our sight by the low cloud cover.
ON LAWRENCE
...staring up at the clouds, listening to the sinister hum.
He turns back to Mandorff and O’Malley who are waiting with
him in the cold. It’s getting dark now.
LAWRENCE
How many is that, Willi?
ARCHBISHOP MANDORFF
One hundred and three, Eminence.
LAWRENCE
I wonder where Tedesco has got to.
MONSIGNOR O'MALLEY
Perhaps he isn’t coming?
LAWRENCE
That would be too much to hope for.
MONSIGNOR O'MALLEY
(Of the cold)
We can wait inside if you prefer?
LAWRENCE
No, let’s get some fresh air while
we still can.
He notices Bellini striding towards them and descends the
steps to greet his friend.
BELLINI
Am I the last?
CONCLAVE by Peter Straughan - Pink Revisions. (27.01.2023) 18.
LAWRENCE
Not quite. How are you?
BELLINI
Oh fairly dreadful. You’ve seen the
papers? Apparently it’s already
decided it’s to be me.
LAWRENCE
And I happen to agree with them.
BELLINI
What if I don’t want it? No sane
man would want the papacy.
LAWRENCE
Some of our colleagues seem to.
BELLINI
But what if I know in my heart I’m
not worthy?
LAWRENCE
You’re more worthy than any of us.
BELLINI
I’m not.
LAWRENCE
Then... t ell your supporters not to
vote for you. Pass the chalice...
Bellini looks past him, his expression hardening.
BELLINI
And let it go to him? How am I to
live with myself if I don’t try to
stop him?
He walks towards the Casa Santa Marta as Lawrence turns to
face the newcomer: TEDESCO, the Patriarch of Venice. He looks
like a retired butcher, broken-nosed, the physique of a bull.
TEDESCO
< Apologies, Lawr ence. My
train was delayed in Venice.>
TEDESCO
Chiedo scusa, Lawrence. Il
mio treno era in ritardo a
Venezia.
LAWRENCE
(Italian)
< Father Tedesco. We’ve
missed you. >
LAWRENCE
Padre Tedesco. Ci siete
mancato.
Tedesco laughs.
CONCLAVE by Peter Straughan - Pink Revisions. (27.01.2023) 19.
TEDESCO
(Italian)
< No doubt. But don’t worry,
my friends have kept me well
informed. >
TEDESCO
Non c'è dubbio. Ma non
preoccupatevi, i miei amici -
how do you say - mi hanno
tenuto ben informato.
Lawrence, refusing to be goaded, keeps his smile in place.
LAWRENCE
(Italian)
< Are you well? >
LAWRENCE
State bene?
TEDESCO
(Italian)
< Ah, no-one is ever well at
our age. How have you found
your new responsibilitie s?
You have everything under
control? >
TEDESCO

CONCLAVE by Peter Straughan - Pink Revisions. (27.01.2023) 21A.
ARCHBISHOP WOZNIAK
In the name of the Father, the Son
and the Holy Ghost. My last
confession was four weeks ago...
Lawrence walks to him, a little irritated.
LAWRENCE
(Helping him up)
Janusz, Janusz, I’m sorry I don’t
have time to hear your confession.
There is so much still to do.
Wozniak sinks into a chair. Wipes sweat from his face with
trembling hands. Lawrence examines him in surprise.
LAWRENCE (CONT’D)
Have you been drinking?
Wozniak looks at him, wretched. Lawrence sighs inwardly.
LAWRENCE (CONT’D)
What’s troubling you? Tell me.
ARCHBISHOP WOZNIAK
I should have come to you before.
But I promised I wouldn’t say
anything.
LAWRENCE
Promised who?
ARCHBISHOP WOZNIAK
Cardinal Tremblay.
Lawrence feels an instinctive stab of alarm, his natural
aversion to secrets. Almost without realising it, he is
drifting back towards the door.
LAWRENCE
Janusz, the doors close soon and
you’ll have to leave. Now if you
promised Father Tremblay then
perhaps it isn’t right for you
to...
ARCHBISHOP WOZNIAK
(Blurting)
The day the Pope died, the last
person to have an official
appointment with him was Cardinal
Tremblay.
CONCLAVE by Peter Straughan - Pink Revisions. (27.01.2023) 22.
LAWRENCE
(Impatient)
Yes, I know. It’s on the official
timeline for...
ARCHBISHOP WOZNIAK
At that meeting, the Holy Father
dismissed him from all his offices
in the Church.
That stops Lawrence in his tracks.
LAWRENCE
What?
ARCHBISHOP WOZNIAK
He sacked him.
Lawrence stares at him. He starts to speak, stops, dimly
aware that he feels anger - anger at being burdened with
this.
LAWRENCE
(Tight)
Why?
ARCHBISHOP WOZ NIAK
For gross misconduct.
Lawrence stares at him, staggered.
LAWRENCE
You...you tell me this now? We are
about to be sequestered and...
ARCHBISHOP WOZNIAK
Forgive me! But it wasn’t until the
last few days, when I started to
hear the rumours...
LAWRENCE
(Sharply)
What rumours?
ARCHBISHOP WOZNIAK
That he might be elected Pope.
LAWRENCE
And you see it as your duty to
prevent that, do you?
ARCHBISHOP WOZNIAK
I no l onger know what my duty is.
CONCLAVE by Peter Straughan - Pink Revisions. (27.01.2023) 23.
It’s said with such obvious sincerity, such misery, that
Lawrence feels ashamed of his anger. He sits.
LAWRENCE
(Beat)
Were you there at this meeting?
ARCHBISHOP WOZNIAK
No, Your Eminence. The Holy Father
told me about it afterwards, when
we had supper.
LAWRENCE
Did he tell you why he had
dismissed Father Tremblay?
ARCHBISHOP WOZNIAK
No. He said the reasons would
become clear soon enough. He was
very angry .
Lawrence feels a brief flare of hope that he could be lying,
but dismisses it quickly.
LAWRENCE
Does anyone else know about this?
ARCHBISHOP WOZNIAK
Monsignor Morales was at the
meeting.
LAWRENCE
Why hasn’t he mentioned anything to
me? He was there in the apartment
with us the night the Holy Father
died.
ARCHBISHOP WOZNIAK
(Tearing up)
After the Holy Father... after ...
(unable to say it)
I went to see M onsignor Morales to
tell him what the Pope had said but
he was very firm. He said there had
been no dismissal and that the Holy
Father had not been his usual self
in the last weeks. He said I
shouldn’t raise the subject again.
But... it’s not right, Eminence.
God tells me it’s not right.
Lawrence stands, pained, one word in his mind. Scandal.

Only the ground floor is now lit, like an aquarium. Lawrence
stands at the entrance in the green light, watching Wozniak
as he walks away. Wozniak raises a hand in awkward farewell
then walks on, as shutters rattle their way down over the
windows, shutting out the world. A SECURITY GUARD closes and
locks the main door.
It is beginning.

The kitchen is crowded with NUNS busy preparing the evening

The NUNS are laying the tables for the evening meal.
SISTER AGNES inspects the placement of the silverware,

Lawrence is walking up the stairs, eager to get to his room.
Behind him O’Malley calls out from reception.
MONSIGNOR O’MALLEY
Your Eminence...
O’Malley hurries over. The usually cheerful Irishman looks
disconcerted. He hesitates.
LAWRENCE
Oh dear God, one of them’s died.
MONSIGNOR O’MALLEY
What?
LAWRENCE
Have we lost a Cardinal?
CONCLAVE by Peter Straughan - Pink Revisions. (27.01.2023) 25.
MONSIGNOR O'MALLEY
No, Your Eminence. We seem to have
acquired one.
(Off Lawrence’s stern
face)
I mean it literally, Eminence.
Another cardinal has just turned
up.
Lawrence stares at him. The day is turning into a nightmare.
O’Malley leads him up the staircase.
LAWRENCE
If we’ve left someone off the
list...
MONSIGNOR O'MALLEY
He was never on our lists. He says
he was created in pectore.
LAWRENCE
(Beat)
He h as to be an imposter, surely?
MONSIGNOR O'MALLEY
That’s what I thought, Eminence.
But Archbishop Mandorff has spoken
to him and thinks not.
O’Malley guides him up the stairs towards Mandorff who stands
with two NUNS. They take in his expression and quickly glide
away.
LAWRENCE
What’s this I’m hearing?
ARCHBISHOP MANDORFF
(Shaken)
His name is Vincent Benitez,
Eminence. He’s the Archbishop of
Kabul.
Lawre nce almost double-takes.
LAWRENCE
Archbishop of where?
ARCHBISHOP MANDORFF
Kabul. He’s Mexican. The Holy
Father appointed him last year.
LAWRENCE
Last year? And how has this been
kept a secret?
CONCLAVE by Peter Straughan - Pink Revisions. (27.01.2023) 26.
ARCHBISHOP MANDORFF
I thought, perhaps, you would be
aware of his elevation.
LAWRENCE
No. I am not.
He feels the nervous gazes of the others on him and gets
control of himself.
LAWRENCE (CONT’D)
Ray, ask Father Bellini to join us.
Perhaps he knew of this.
O’Malley hurries off.
ARCHBISHOP MANDORFF
He has a letter of appointment from
the Pope addressed to the
archdiocese of Kabul, which they
kept secret at the Hol y Father’s
request.
(Beat)
You don’t think he could have
forged it?
Lawrence sighs.
LAWRENCE
Where is he now?
INT. CASA SANTA MARTA - KITCHEN STORAGE - NIGHT32 32
We’re looking at a slim man dressed in a somewhat shabby
plain black attire with no skull cap. This is BENITEZ. He
sits on a plastic chair, rosary in hand.
Lawrence, Bellini, Mandorff and O’Malley watch him through
the glass wall of the room.
BEL LINI
A cardinal in Afghanistan? It’s
absurd. How many catholics are
there in Afghanistan?
Lawrence gestures to the LETTER he’s holding.
LAWRENCE
He was the Head of the Catholic
Mission there until his...
elevation.
CONCLAVE by Peter Straughan - Pink Revisions. (27.01.2023) 27.
BELLINI
The Americans will be appalled. How
could we possibly ensure his
safety?
LAWRENCE
Presumably that’s why the Holy
Father wanted it kept secret.
(Beat)
Well it won’t be in pectore now. I
don’t think we have any choice but
to admit him.
He moves to enter the office but Bellini takes his arm. He
stops, turns to Bellini, who seems as surprised as him at his
intervention. For a moment the Italian con tinues to stare at
the newcomer. It’s as if there’s something about Benitez that
Bellini finds obscurely troubling. Then...
BELLINI
(Quietly)
Must we?
(Off Thomas' puzzled look)
Are we sure the Holy Father was
entirely... competent to make this
appointment?
Lawrence stares at him, thinking back to Wozniak’s words,
tempted by the explanation of mental confusion... Bellini
misreads the silence as disapproval.
BELLINI (CONT’D)
Papal infallibility covers
doctrine. It does not extend to
appointments.
LAWRENCE
(Beat)
That man is leg ally a cardinal,
Aldo. He has a right to take part
in the election.
INT. CASA SANTA MARTA - KITCHEN OFFICE - NIGHT33 33
Benitez stands as LAWRENCE and Bellini walk in.
LAWRENCE
Welcome to the Vatican, Archbishop.
I’m Father Lawrence, Dean of the

I’m sorry you’ve had to wait. We
had to make checks I’m afraid.
CONCLAVE by Peter Straughan - Pink Revisions. (27.01.2023) 28.
Benitez smoothes a lock of dark hair back from his rather
boyish face.
BENITEZ
It is I who must apologise for such
an unexpected entrance.
BELLINI
(Reluctantly)
Archbishop, forgive me, but I have
to say I think you’ve made a
mistake coming here.
BENITEZ
Why is that, Your Eminence?
Bellini looks between the two men - isn’t it obvious?
BELLINI
I would have thought the position
of Christians in Central Asia w as
perilous enough without you having
been made a cardinal and showing
yourself in Rome.
BENITEZ
I’m aware of the risks.
BELLINI
But now you’re here I don’t see how
you expect to go back.
BENITEZ
I’ll go back. And face the
consequences of my faith, like so
many others.
Bellini tilts a head, as if to say - charming but naive.
BELLINI
Your return will have diplomatic
repercussions and therefore will
not, necessarily, be your decision.
BENITEZ
(Mildly)
Nor yours, Eminence. It will be a
decision for the next Pope.
Bellini opens his mouth and closes it again. Lawrence
examines the fragile looking man, reevaluating. He’s tougher
than he looks.
CONCLAVE by Peter Straughan - Pink Revisions. (27.01.2023) 29.
LAWRENCE
Well, the first thing is to find
you a room. Where’s your luggage?
BENITEZ
I don’t have any.
LAWRENCE
None?
BENITEZ
I thought it best to go to the
airport empty-handed, to disguise
my intentions.
LAWRENCE
(Recovering)
Ray?
O’Malley pops his head in.
LAWRENCE (CONT’D)
His Eminence will require
toiletries, some clean clothes, and
choir dress of course.
(To Benitez)
Monsignor O’Malley will look after
you.
Looking suddenly exhausted, Benitez follows O’Malley out of
the office. Lawrence glances at Bellini, a little puzzled by
his friend’s faint hostility. Bellini shrugs, as if a little
puzzled himself.
BELLINI

It’s just so...irregular.

Lawrence walks down the corridor to his room and finds
Adeyemi approaching from the other end. He raises a hand in

They stand smiling, slightly awkwardly, key cards in hand.

He chuckles at his own joke.
ADEYEMI (CONT’D)

They nod to each other and both go into their rooms.
INT. CASA SANTA MARTA - LAWRENCE'S ROOM - NIGHT35 35
Lawrence sits, back to us, hunched over the small de sk,
staring at the shuttered window in front of him, lost in
thought.
From the next room, through the thin walls, he hears the
sound of coughing, a toilet flushing...
He stirs, picks up his pen and resumes work on his sermon.

We realise Lawrence is practicing his sermon in his BATHROOM,
before the m irror.
He stops, feels a twinge of contempt for its bland tone.
He puts the sermon aside, examines the cheap little plastic
wrapped package of razor, tooth brush and toothpaste, fumbles
with it for a moment.

He finally rips it open and its contents fall to the floor.
Lawrence sighs, examines his reflection again for a moment.

Manage.
INT. CASA SANTA MARTA - DINING ROOM - NIGHT37 37
CLOSE ON SISTER AGNES
...a watchful silent presence, as ever. She monitors the nuns
as they fan through the...
...LARGE ROOM running down one side of the lobby. White
marble floors, tables set for dinner, the din of conversation
from the assembled cardinals. It could be a business
convention.
Her gaze lands on the Americans seated at one table, talking
loudly. Tremblay in the middle, joking and laughing with
them.
Lawrence takes a knife and glass and raps it for attention.
The room gradually falls silent except for Cardinal
KRASINSKI, the arch-conservative Archbishop Emeritus of
Chicago who continues speaking loudly until he is hushed by
his neighbours, and adjusts his hearing-aid, resulting in an
electronic howl that causes them to wince.
Benitez standing alone, apart.
LAWRENCE
Your Eminences, before we eat I
should like to introduce a new
member of our order, whose
existence was not known to any of
us until a few hours ago.
(Raising a hand to the
stir of surprise)
This is because our brother was
made a cardinal by a perfectly
legitimate procedure known as
creation in pectore. The reason why
it had to be done this way is known
only to God and to the late Holy
Father. But I think we can guess
well enough as our new brother’s
ministry is an extremely dangerous
one. (MORE)
CONCLAVE by Peter Straughan - Pink Revisions. (27.01.2023) 32.
It has not been an easy journey for
him to join us but now, by the
Grace of God a brotherhood of one
hundred and seven has become one
hundred and eight. Welcome to our
order, Vincent Benitez, Cardinal
Archbishop of Kabul.
A general sense of mystification from his audience. He begins
to applaud and for a painful moment he is the only one
clapping. Gradually the others join in.
LAWRENCE (CONT’D)
Would you bles s our meal, Eminence?
Benitez looks alarmed at the prospect but nods. The cardinals
lower their heads, eyes closed.
BENITEZ
Bless us, O Lord, and these Your
gifts which we are about to receive
from Your bounty.
Several of the cardinals begin to make the sign of the cross,
presuming this is the end.
BENITEZ (CONT’D)
(in Spanish)
Bless too, all those who
cannot share this meal. And
help us, O Lord, as we eat
and drink, to remember the
hungry, the thirsty, the sick
and the lonely, and those
sisters who prepared this
food for us. Through Christ
Our Lord, Amen.

LAWRENCE
I’ll give him this, he clearly has

CARDINAL SABBADIN
It was shrewd of him to stay away

Listen you don’t have to do
anything, leave it to us. But if
they ask us what you stand for...?
BELLINI
Tell them I stand for a common-

gays, or divorce. Tell them I stand

Brother, I have no intention of
concealing my views or pretending

He doesn’t want this. Any of it.

He hesitates, embarrassed.
LAWRENCE
What?
Tremblay looks up at him, a little guiltily.
TREMBLAY
The drinking? (Beat) I don’t like
to bring it up, but w e both know
his drinking has been getting
heavier and perhaps it’s affecting
his judgement, his mind even? I
know my name has been mentioned as
a future Pope and if the Archbishop
does not approve of the idea then
perhaps...
CONCLAVE by Peter Straughan - Pink Revisions. (27.01.2023) 39.
He waves a hand again, embarrassed.
TREMBLAY (CONT’D)
I don’t know. I’m just trying to
make sense of... and I know the
poor man was shattered by the Holy
Father’s death.
He finishes his espresso. Lawrence is desperate for this to
be over.
LAWRENCE
Yes. Indeed. Again, Joe, my
apologies for...
TREMBLAY
No, not at all. I quite understand.
They head for the door. Then to his own surprise, Lawrence
says...
LAWRENCE
What did you discuss with the Holy
Father in that final meeting?
Tremblay blinks. When he answers his manner is a little
cooler - as if the insult of the accusation has just caught
up with him.
TREMBLAY
Forgive me, but it was a private
conversation, Thomas. And very
precious. The last words I
exchanged with the Holy Father.
Beat. Then Lawrence inclines his head.
LAWRENCE
I quite understand.
Tremblay open s the door in silence, waits for Lawrence to
step out the room then switches off the brilliant lights,
closes the door plunging us into darkness.
We HOLD in the black...

CONCLAVE by Peter Straughan - Pink Revisions. (27.01.2023) 40.
INT. CASA SANTA MARTA - LAWRENCE'S ROOM - NIGHT41 41
Lawrence wakes suddenly. From the next room comes the sound
of stentorian snoring. He tries to screen it out. But sleep
seems impossible now. He sits up in bed.
INT. CASA SANTA MARTA - GYM - NIGHT42 42
Lawrence walks on the treadmill, the only figure in the large
room. He stares at his reflection in the mirrored wall as he
speed walks, listening to the h ypnotic thrum, thrum of the
treadmill.
TITLE CARD: FIRST DAY OF CONCLAVE
EXT. CASA SANTA MARTA - COURTYARD - MORNING43 43
HIGH ANGLE - from the top of the balcony. The courtyard below
is a sea of red: cardinals robed for the coming service.
Lawrence stands staring down at them, an air of trepidation
behind the eyes. Below a single nun in blue is lost among the
red.
FATHER HAAS (O.S.)
Your Eminence?
Behind him Father Haas has appeared in the hall. Lawrence
blinks out of his thoughts.
INT. CASA SANTA MARTA - SIDE ROOM - MORNING44 44
Haas is robing Lawrence, fussing around like a tailor,
adjusting the heavy red chasuble. He places the tall, white
mitre on Lawrence’s head, stands back to survey its angle
critically. He hands Lawrence the crozier - a golden
Shepherd’s crook.
FATHER HAAS
How does it feel, Your Eminence?
LAWRENCE
Good. Thank you.
We hear the chanting of the Gospel of St John...
CONCLAVE by Peter Straughan - Pink Revisions. (27.01.2023) 41.
INT. “ROOM OF CARDINALS” - MORNING45 45
A bare space. Lawrence looks out at the rows of the
congregation that have been crammed into the room: the red of
the cardinals, purple of the Bishops, white of the Priests...
They sit and stand in front of him.
Lawrence sits, clutching the sermon in his lap, hiding the
turmoil going on inside him. His gaze flits across the ranks
of cardinals, finding the main co ntenders: Adeyemi, Bellini,
Tremblay and finally Tedesco. Haas appears in front of him
and removes the mitre, catches something in the Dean’s
expression as he does so.
FATHER HAAS
(Concerned, softly)
Are you well, Eminence?
LAWRENCE
I’m fine.
The choir comes to an end.
ON THE MICROPHONE - as Lawrence steps in front of it. For a
moment he stares out over the room of faces. He stares down
at the pages of h omily. The moment hangs until there’s a
faint stirring of unease. Finally...
LAWRENCE (CONT’D)
(Reading, Italian)
< Dear Brothers in Christ, at
this moment of great
uncertainty in the history of
the Holy Church we must think
first of the late Holy Father
whose brilliant pontificate
was a gift from God. >
LAWRENCE (CONT’D)
Cari fratelli in Cristo, in
questo momento di grande
incertezza nella storia della
Santa Chiesa d obbiamo pensare
innanzitutto al defunto Santo
Padre, il cui brillante
pontificato è stato un dono
di Dio.
A murmur of approval from the congregation.
LAWRENCE (CONT’D)
< Now we must ask our Lord to
send us a new Holy Father
through the pastoral
solicitude of the cardinal
fathers and we must pray to
God for that loving
assistance and ask Him to
guide us to the right
choice.>
LAWRENCE (CONT’D)
Ora dobbiamo chiedere a
n ostro Signore di mandarci un
nuovo Santo Padre attraverso
la sollecitudine pastorale
dei padri cardinali e
dobbiamo pregare Dio per
questa amorevole assistenza e
chiedere la sua guida nel
compiere la scelta giusta.
He looks out at his audience, his gaze once more falling on
Tedesco watching him with a faint complacent smile.
CONCLAVE by Peter Straughan - Pink Revisions. (27.01.2023) 42.
He turns the page, scans the text, and the next page...
platitudes, platitudes...
Suddenly he puts the sermon aside. For the first time in days
he feels calm.
LAWRENCE (CONT’D)
(In English)
But you all know that.
There is some surprised laughter.
LAWRENCE (CONT’D)
Let me speak from the heart for the
moment.
Now there’s a definite stirring of alarm amongst the
cardinals.
LAWRENCE (CONT’D)
St Paul said “Be subject to one
another out of reverence for
Christ.” To work together, and grow
together, we must be tolerant.
The room is entirely still now...
INTERCUT WITH:
INT. “ROOM OF CARDINALS” ANTECHAMBER - MORNING46 46
... whilst right outside the door SISTER AGNES and a few of
her nuns are silently listening to Lawrence’s speech.
LAWRENCE
St Paul said that God’s gift to the
Church is its variety. It is this
variety, this diversity of people
and views that gives our Church its
strength. In the course of a long
life in the service of our Mother
th e Church, let me tell you that
there is one sin I have come to
fear above all others. Certainty.
Certainty is the great enemy of
unity. Certainty is the deadly
enemy of tolerance. Even Christ was
not certain at the end.
Lawrence switches into Italian.
CONCLAVE by Peter Straughan - Pink Revisions. (27.01.2023) 43.
LAWRENCE (CONT’D)
“Dio mio, Dio mio, perché mi hai
abbandonato?"
LAWRENCE (CONT’D)
(back to English)
“My God, my God, why have you
forsaken me?” He cried out in His
agony at the ninth hour on the
cross. Our faith is a living thing
precisely because it walks hand in
hand with doubt. If there was only
certainty, and if there was no
doubt, there would be no mystery,
and therefore no need for faith.
Let us pray that God will grant us
a Pope who doubts. Let Him grant us
a Pope who sins and asks for
forgiveness. And carries on.
He looks out over the cardinals and sees they are unified by
a single emotion. Shock.
EXT. CASA SANTA MARTA - COURTYARD - DAY47 47
Lawrence is led by Haas and some ASSISTANTS through the
courtyard, crowded with cardinals. Lawrence feels their eyes
upon him.
INT. CASA SANTA MARTA - SIDE ROOM - DAY48 48
Lawrence stands being disrobed by Haas and the Assistants.
None of the younger men can look Lawrence in the face.
O’Malley arrives holding the discarded sermon.
MONSIGNOR O'MALLEY
(Awkward)
Dean, your homily... I’m not
entirely clear whether or not it
should be placed in the Vatican
archive or not? As it was not the
homily you... actually...
delivered?
LAWRENCE
I’m not sure either.
Lawrence examines the usually ebullient Irishman and realises
even he is avoiding his gaze.
LAWRENCE (CONT’D)
Was it that bad, Ray?
CONCLAVE by Peter Straughan - Pink Revisions. (27.01.2023) 44.
MONSIGNOR O'MALLEY
(Hurriedly)
Not at all, Your Eminence. It has
caused quite a stir. I don’t think
anyone expected you to... to...
LAWRENCE
(Smiling)
Say something interesting?
Haas lifts the chasuble over his head, and LAWRENCE rotates
his stiff neck, relieved to be free of the weight.
LAWRENCE (CONT’D)
(As Haas leaves)
Thank you, Father.
MONSIGNOR O’MALLEY
I’ll have a transcript made of the
text from the tape, Em inence. If
there’s nothing else...
Lawrence hesitates, as O’Malley turns to go. Then...
LAWRENCE
I need you to do something for me.
Monsignor Morales. I’m sure he’s
still in Rome. Could you try and
see him? Use my authority.
MONSIGNOR O’MALLEY
(Surprised)
Today? I...I could try, your
Eminence?
LAWRENCE
I need to know what happened in the
final meeting between the Holy
Father and Cardinal Tremblay.
MONSIGN OR O’MALLEY
What...happened?
Lawrence takes a deep breath, and...
LAWRENCE
Specifically, did anything occur
that might render Cardinal Tremblay
unfit to assume the papacy?
O’Malley gapes at him, recovers himself.
MONSIGNOR O’MALLEY
Of course, Eminence.
CONCLAVE by Peter Straughan - Pink Revisions. (27.01.2023) 45.
LAWRENCE
Bless you.
INT. CASA SANTA MARTA - LOBBY - DAY49 49
Lawrence is heading for the lift when...
TEDESCO (O.S.)
(Booming, Italian)
< Well, Dean... >
TEDESCO (O.S.)
(tonante)
Beh, Decano...
Lawrence turns to find Tedesco advancing on him, drawing the
attention of the crowded lobby.
CONCLAVE by Peter Straughan - Pink Revisions. (27.01.2023) 45A.
TEDESCO (CONT’D)
(Italian)
< St Paul as an Apostle of
Doubt. I’ve never heard that
one before! >
TEDESCO (CONT’D)
San Paolo come apostolo del
dubbio. Non l'avevo mai
sentita prima!
Lawrence continues to the lift, determined to avoid a public
argument.
TEDESCO (CONT’D)
< Wasn’t it St Paul who said,
“If the trumpet shall give an
uncertain note, who will
prepare himself for battle?”>
TEDESCO (CONT’D)
Non è stato forse San Paolo a
dire: "E s e la tromba emette
un suono confuso, chi si
preparerà alla battaglia?"
Lawrence presses for the lift and the doors glide open.
LAWRENCE
(in Latin)
Perhaps it would have been more
palatable for you in Latin,
Eminence?
He steps into the lift before Tedesco can reply.
INT. CASA SANTA MARTA - LOBBY LIFT - DAY50 50
Lawrence, a little pleased with his retort, is about to press
the button for his floor when he su ddenly pats his pockets.
He closes his eyes.
INT. CASA SANTA MARTA - LOBBY - DAY51 51
Lawrence emerges from the lift again, to the surprise of
Tedesco and the other cardinals. Aware he’s just ruined his
exit, he walks back to the RECEPTION DESK, trying to look
unconcerned.
LAWRENCE
I’m sorry, I forgot my key.
SISTER AGNES examines him sternly from behind the desk.
SISTER AGNES
I hope you take better care of the
Keys of St Peter than you do of the
keys to your room.
She reaches under the counter and hands him a KEY CARD.
CONCLAVE by Peter Straughan - Pink Revisions. (27.01.2023) 46.
SISTER AGNES (CONT’D)
That’s my pass key. If you could
remember to return it.
CONCLAVE by Peter Straughan - Pink Revisions. (27.01.2023) 46A.
Lawrence nods, feeling like a scolded child. Sister Agnes
walks into the back office. Lawrence turns to find Bellini
standing beside him. His friend gives an awful smile.
BELLINI
(Quietly)
Well, I’m puzzled. You tell me you
wanted to resign and then you step
out of the shadows like this?
It takes Lawrence a moment to realise there is anger in
Bellini’s voice.
BELLINI (CONT’D)
Now - who knows how things may tu rn
out?
He’s gone before Lawrence can think of a reply.
EXT. CASA SANTA MARTA - PARKING - DAY52 52
The cardinals are boarding a fleet of white minibuses as it
begins to rain.
MONSIGNOR O'MALLEY
(Directing the boarding)
Cardinal Gambino... Cardinal
Dell’Acqua...
Lawrence waits to board, still thinking of Bellini’s words.
We hear an organ playing, a choir singing Veni Creator
Spiritus...
I/E. MINIBUS - DAY53 53
As the music continues we find Lawrence sitting alone,
biretta on his lap, staring out the rain-smeared windows to
the security men patrolling the Vatican grounds beyond. The
cardinals all around him are silent, the mood on the bus is
sombre, the moment of responsibility has come.
EXT. CORTILE DEL MARESCIALLO - DAY54 54
A narrow strip of grey sky above the parked buses. Security
for ces linger about, smoking and chatting. The bus driver
eats a sandwich.
CONCLAVE by Peter Straughan - Pink Revisions. (27.01.2023) 47.
INT. SCALA REGIA - DAY54A 54A
A security guard scrolls through his phone, standing on the
marble staircase. We hear the cardinals taking their oath.
JUNIOR CARDINAL-DEACON
GUERRINI (O.S.)
(In Latin)
< ...I Antonio Cardinal
Guerrini do so promise,
pledge and swear, so help me
God and these Holy Gospels
which I touch with my hand. >
JUNIOR CARDINAL-DEACON
GUERRINI (O.S.)
...Et ego Antonius Cardinalis
Guerrini spondeo, voveo ac
iuro, Sic me Deus adiuvet et
haec Sancta Dei Evangelia,
quae manu mea tango.
INT. SISTINE CHAPEL - DAY55 55
The last of the cardinals stand taking the oath. The others
have now taken their seats at the rows of desks filling the
room.
CARDINAL BROTZKUS
(In Latin)
< ...I Romuald Cardinal
Brotzkus do so promise,
pledge and swear... >
CARDINAL BROTZKUS
...Et ego Romualdus
Cardinalis Brotzkus spondeo,
voveo ac iuro...
Lawrence finds himself staring up at Michelangelo’s The Last
Judgement. One of the Damned clutches a hand to his face as
demons drag him down...
CARDINAL BROTZKUS (CONT’D)
< So help me God and these
Holy Gospels which I touch
with my hand. >
CARDINAL BROTZKUS (CONT’D)
Sic me Deus adiuvet et haec
Sancta Dei Evangelia, quae
manu mea tango.
CARDINAL NAKITANDA
Et ego Irumbus Cardinalis Nakitanda
s pondeo, voveo ac iuro, sic me Deus
adiuvet et haec Sancta Dei
Evangelia, quae manu mea tango.
Lawrence blinks as Mandorff steps up to the microphone that
has been placed before the west wall of the chamber.
ARCHBISHOP MANDORFF
Extra omnes.
The television lights are switched off plunging the chamber
into relative gloom. Mandorff makes his way to the vestibule
as priests, officials, choristers, securit y men, cameramen,
photographer and the commandant of the Swiss Guard leave the
chapel. The three scrutineers, CARDINALS LUKSA, MERCURIO and
LOMBARDI, take their place at a table in front of the altar.
CONCLAVE by Peter Straughan - Pink Revisions. (27.01.2023) 48.
Lawrence catches Adeyemi’s eye. Cardinal Tedesco glances at
Bellini who looks at Tremblay across from him.
In the vestibule Mandorff passes through the huge doors...
INT. OUTSIDE SISTINE CHAPEL - DAY56 56
...to close them after him.
INT. SISTINE CHAPEL - DAY57 57
We hear the sound of a key turning. The great bell of St
Peter’s begins tolling five o’clock.
The Conclave has begun .
LAWRENCE walks to the microphone.
LAWRENCE
< Cardinal brothers, we will
now proceed to the first
ballot. >
(Holding up a ballot
paper)
< You will find in front of
you your ballot paper. On the
top half is written... >
(Glancing ironically at
Tedesco)
< Eligo in Summum Pontificem.
“I elect as Supreme Pontiff”.
Beneath this you must write
the name of your chosen
candidate. Please make sure
your hand-writ ing is
legible.>
LAWRENCE
Fratelli Cardinali, procederà
ora al primo scrutinio.
(Holding up a paper
ballot)
Troverete davanti a voi la
vostra scheda elettorale.
Sulla metà superiore è
scritto...
(Glancing Ironically at
Tedesco)
Eligo in Summum Pontificem.
”Eleggo Sommo Pontefice”.
Sotto di essa dovete scrivere
il nome del candidato che
avete scelto. Assicuratevi
che la vostra calligrafia sia
leggibile.
La wrence returns to his seat and picks up his own ballot
paper. He shields the paper with his arm and writes BELLINI,
folds it and walks back to the altar. He holds it above his
head.
LAWRENCE (CONT’D)
(In Latin)
< I call as my witness Christ
the Lord who will be my
judge, that my vote is given
to the one who before God I
think should be elected. >
LAWRENCE (CONT’D)
Testor Christum Dominum, qui
me iudicaturus est, me eu m
eligere, quem secundum Deum
iudico eligi debere.
Under the gaze of the three cardinals he places his ballot in
the large urn on the altar.
CONCLAVE by Peter Straughan - Pink Revisions. (27.01.2023) 49.
He returns to his seat, his eyes straying to where Bellini
sits, apparently sunk in meditation. One by one the cardinals
begin to rise and vote, ballots held above their heads...
INT. SISTINE CHAPEL - DAY / LATER58 58
The three Scrutineers sit at the table in front of the altar,
counting the votes from the urn. Luksa unfolds a ballot,
notes the name, passes it to Lombardi who also records the
result an d passes it to Mercurio who pierces the vote through
the word elect and threads it onto a length of scarlet silk
cord.
CARDINAL LOMBARDI
(Italian)
< The first vote is cast for
Cardinal Tedesco. >
CARDINAL LOMBARDI
Il primo voto è per il
Cardinale Tedesco.
Lawrence doesn’t react, just makes a tick next to Tedesco’s
name on his list of cardinals. Lombardi reads the next
ballot.
CARDINAL LOMBARDI (CONT’D)
(Italian)
< The second vote is cast for
Cardinal Tedesco. >
CARDINAL LOMBARDI (CONT’D)
Il secondo voto è per il
Cardinale Tedesco.
Again. Lombardi records the next ballot.
CARDINAL LOMBARDI (CONT’D)
(Italian)
Cardinal Tremblay.
CARDINAL LOMBARDI (CONT’D)
Cardinale Tremblay.
Lawrence ticks the name...
CARDINAL LOMBARDI (CONT’D)
(Reading the next
ballot)
< Cardinal Tremblay. >
CARDINAL LOMBARDI (CONT’D)
(Reading the next
ballot)
Cardinale Tremblay.
...and again...
C ARDINAL LOMBARDI (CONT’D)
< Cardinal Lawrence. > CARDINAL LOMBARDI (CONT’D)
Cardinale Lawrence.
Lawrence looks up, startled. He finds Bellini watching him.
CARDINAL LOMBARDI (CONT’D)
< Cardinal Bellini. > CARDINAL LOMBARDI (CONT’D)
Cardinale Bellini.
Lawrence focuses on his list again, hurriedly ticking the
names...
CONCLAVE by Peter Straughan - Pink Revisions. (27.01.2023) 50.
INT. SISTINE CHAPEL - DAY / LATER59 59
CLOSE on the URN - now almost empty of ballots. Luksa’s hand
reaches in.
Lawrence is hurriedly adding up the votes in pencil beside
his list.
CARDINAL LOMBARDI
< Cardinal Bellini. >
(Italian, Receiving the
next ballot)
< Cardinal Tremblay. >
(Beat)
< Cardinal Adeyemi. >
CARDINAL LOMBARDI
Cardinale Bellini.
(Italian, Receiving the
next ballot)
Cardinale Tremblay.
(Beat)
Car dinale Adeyemi.
Lawrence scribbles away...
CARDINAL LOMBARDI (CONT’D)
< And finally... Cardinal
Benitez. >
CARDINAL LOMBARDI (CONT’D)
E infine... Cardinale
Benítez.
Again, Lawrence looks up in surprise. Benitez himself has
raised his head in shock. Whispered conversations break out
around the chamber. The three Scrutineers confer briefly then
Lombardi leans into the microphone again.
CARDINAL LOMBARDI (CONT’D)
(Italian)
< The res ults of the first
ballot are... Cardinal
Adeyemi, twenty-one votes.
Cardinal Tedesco, eighteen
votes. Cardinal Bellini,
seventeen votes. Cardinal
Tremblay, sixteen votes.
Cardinal Lawrence, five
votes... >
CARDINAL LOMBARDI (CONT’D)
I risultati del primo
scrutinio sono i seguenti:
Cardinale Adeyemi, ventuno
voti. Cardinale Tedesco,
diciotto voti. Cardinale
Bellini, diciassette voti.
Cardinale Tremblay, sedi ci
voti. Cardinale Lawrence,
cinque voti...
Lawrence flinches, dismayed at this.
CARDINAL LOMBARDI (CONT’D)
< Other cardinals assigned a
single vote, thirty-one
votes. >
CARDINAL LOMBARDI (CONT’D)
Altri cardinali che hanno
ricevuto un solo voto,
trentuno voti.
The hum of conversation grows louder as Lawrence stands and
walks to the microphone.
CONCLAVE by Peter Straughan - Pink Revisions. (27.01.2023) 51.
LAWRENCE
(Raising his voice over
the hubbub )
< My brother cardinals... my
brother cardinals, that
concludes the first ballot.
No candidate having achieved
the necessary majority of
seventy-two votes, we shall
adjourn for the evening and
resume voting in the morning.
I now invite the Junior
Cardinal-Deacon to ask for us
to be released. >
LAWRENCE
(Raising his voice above
the hubbub)
Fratelli cardinali. ..
fratelli cardinali, con
questo si conclude il primo
scrutinio. Poiché nessun
candidato ha ottenuto la
maggioranza necessaria di
settantadue voti, per la
serata la seduta è aggiornata
e riprenderemo le votazioni
domattina. Ora invito
l’ultimo cardinale diacono a
dire che ci vengano ad
aprire.
His gaze flits to Bellini, who sits, staring into nothing.
Guerrini walks to the back of the chapel and k nocks on the
doors.
JUNIOR CARDINAL-DEACON GUERRINI
Aprite le porte! Aprite le porte!
INT. OUTSIDE SISTINE CHAPEL - DAY59A 59A
Archbishop Mandorff waits outside the Sistine Chapel. He now
unlocks the doors and they begin to swing open...
INT. SISTINE CHAPEL - VESTIBULE - LATE AFTERNOON60 60
Monsignor O’Malley squats by the stove, their chimneys rising
to a window high above. He bundles inside the threaded ballo t
papers. He ignites them with a fire-lighter, closes the door
as they begin to blaze. He turns to the second stove and
presses a switch.
INT. INSIDE THE STOVE - LATE AFTERNOON60A 60A
INSIDE THE STOVE - the canister of potassium perchlorate,
anthracene and sulphur activates with a whoosh...
EXT. SISTINE CHAPEL - LATE AFTERNOON61 61
The temporary metal chimney jutting out above the roof of the
chapel begins t o gush jet-black smoke, illuminated by a
search-light. The smoke streams up to the winter sky and the
waiting world. A dull roar swells and fades. It takes us a
moment to realise it’s the response of the vast crowd
gathered outside.
CONCLAVE by Peter Straughan - Pink Revisions. (27.01.2023) 52.
INT. EMPTY ROOMS - LATE AFTERNOON61A 61A
As the dull roar continues to resound from outside rooms
inside the Vatican lie still and empty in the late afternoon
light. The canary listens in his cage.
INT. SALA REGIA - LATE AFTERNOON62 62
Lawrence and O’Malley hurry through the hall.
MONSIGNOR O'MALLEY
The media have noticed the presence
of a cardinal who doesn’t appear on
the official lists, Dean. The press
off ice have been receiving requests
for information, so I’ve taken the
liberty of putting together a draft
statement. I’ve also put together
some biographical details for you.
(Glancing through some
sheets of paper)
Ministries in Veracruz, the Congo,
established a hospital for female
victims of the genocidal sexual
violence during the first and
second wars. Then Baghdad. And
finally the Mission in Ka bul.
There was some question of his
resigning on health grounds, but
apparently the Holy Father
convinced him to continue.
(Handing the sheets to
Lawrence)
He’s certainly served his ministry
in some terrible places.
LAWRENCE
(Absently)
On health grounds? Look into that
will you Ray? Kind of thing the
press like to get hold of.
Lawrence glances back at the SECURITY MAN who follows them at
a discrete di stance.
LAWRENCE (CONT’D)
(Quietly)
And the other matter...?
CONCLAVE by Peter Straughan - Pink Revisions. (27.01.2023) 53.
INT. SCALA REGIA - LATE AFTERNOON63 63
The two men descend the stairs, dwarfed by the vast sweep of
white marble. Another SECURITY MAN waits below them.
MONSIGNOR O'MALLEY
I spoke to Monsignor Morales. He
was emphatic that he knows of no
reason why Cardinal Tremblay should
not be Pope.
Lawrence nods, wonders why he does not feel any relief.
LAWRENCE
Thank you.
They pass the SECURITY GUARD who turns and wh ispers into his
sleeve. When they are safely past, O’Malley hesitates.
Then...
MONSIGNOR O'MALLEY
(Low)
However, will you forgive me if I
say that I did not entirely believe
the good monsignor?
Lawrence stares at him as they walk on.
MONSIGNOR O'MALLEY (CONT’D)
He was just... so emphatic? My
Spanish is quite poor and I may
have... accidentally... given him
the impression that you had seen a
document that contr adicted that?
And he said you weren’t to worry
about that. His exact words were -
“El informe ha sido retirado.”
LAWRENCE
A “report?” A report on what?
Withdrawn when?
MONSIGNOR O'MALLEY
That I couldn’t say, Eminence.
They walk on towards the Cortile del Maresciallo and the
waiting minibuses.
I/E. MINIBUS - LATE AFTERNOON64 64
Lawrence is last on the bus and the only seat still available
is at the front, near Sabbadin.
CONCLAVE by Peter Straughan - Pink Revisions. (27.01.2023) 54.
Reluctantly Lawrence sits down across the aisle from him. For
a moment the two sit in silence, Sabbadin staring out of the
window. Then...
CARDINAL SABBADIN
(Sourly)
Third place. Not what we had hoped.
(Beat)
Your sermon didn’t exactly help us.
And your five votes... with the
greatest respect Thomas, you have
far too little support to emerge as
a serious candidate. There hasn’t
been an English Pope f or a thousand
years.
LAWRENCE
(Without looking at him)
My position is an embarrassment to
me. If I find out who my supporters
are I’ll plead with them to vote
for someone else. And I’ll tell
them I’ll be voting for Bellini.
Sabbadin nods, mollified.
CARDINAL SABBADIN
Alright, that’s five votes coming
to us, which takes us to twenty-
two. All the candidates who
received one vote today will fall
away. Tha t leaves thirty-one votes
available. We simply have to pick
up most of them.
Uncomfortable, Lawrence glances at the driver’s face in the
rear-view mirror, trying to gauge if he has been listening.
INT. CASA SANTA MARTA - DINING ROOM - NIGHT65 65
The cardinals stand around in cliques, sipping wine before
the evening meal. Adeyemi, as the front runner, seems to have
gathered the largest crowd.
Alone, Lawre nce is watching Benitez talking to the cardinals
from Asia and Oceania. Cardinal Mendoza arrives beside him,
follows his gaze.
CARDINAL MENDOZA
(Of Benitez)
An interesting man. I am very
pleased to hear of his elevation.
CONCLAVE by Peter Straughan - Pink Revisions. (27.01.2023) 55.
LAWRENCE
You know him?
CARDINAL MENDOZA
Of him. I was with the Mission in
Iraq, after his time, and people
still spoke of him there and the
work he had done.
TEDESCO (O.S.)
(in English)
So...our dark horse.
Lawrence sighs, turns to find Tedesco and Tremblay beside
him, also surveying the room.
LAWRENCE
Don’t be absurd. I will do all in
my power to withdraw my name from
the second vote.
TEDESCO
(English)
Why?
L AWRENCE
Because I don’t wish to compromise
my neutrality as Dean.
TEDESCO
(English)
Too late.
Tedesco chuckles, continuing in Italian.
TEDESCO (CONT’D)
< Ah, don’t worry about it.
As far as I’m concerned, I
want you to continue as a
candidate. You’re splitting
the liberal vote. >
TEDESCO (CONT’D)
Ah, non preoccupatevi.
Per quanto mi riguarda,
voglio che restiate in lizza.
Grazie a voi il voto dei
liberali è diviso.
He pats Lawrence's shoulder and walks off.
LAWRENCE
If anyone brings up my name please
tell them of my intentions. All I
want to do is serve the Conclave. I
can’t do that if I’m seen as a
contender myself.
Tremblay smiles, nods.
CONCLAVE by Peter Straughan - Pink Revisions. (27.01.2023) 56.
TREMBLAY
Alright.
CONCLAVE by Peter Straughan - Pink Revisions. (27.01.2023) 56A.
He gives a short laugh.
TREMBLAY (CONT’D)
Of course, a more Machiavellian
mind might say it will make you
look like a paragon of virtue.
He laughs again, as if at the absurdity of the suggestion.
LAWRENCE
(Cool)
Well, I shall leave you to handle
it as you see fit.
He walks away.
EXT. APOSTOLIC PALACE - PORTONE DI BRONZO - NIGHT66 66
Lawrence and O’Malley walk towards the vast bronze entrance
to the palace, past s aluting Swiss Guards.
INT. APOSTOLIC PALACE - STAIRCASE - NIGHT67 67
The two walk in silence up the deserted staircase of what
would traditionally be the Papal Apartments.
INT. APOSTOLIC PALACE - SALA - NIGHT67A 67A
They cross a big room and walk into...
INT. PAPAL SECRETARY’S OFFICE - NIGHT68 68
Lawrence stands at a filing cabinet, looking through the
folders of documents inside. He checks the final folder,
clos es the drawer, unsure whether he feels relieved or
disappointed. O’Malley watches. A beat.
MONSIGNOR O’MALLEY
(Tentatively)
I could try and speak to Monsignor
Morales again? See if I could find
out any more?
LAWRENCE
No, no...
(Gesturing to the room,
them)
This is all so... unseemly.
(MORE)
CONCLAVE by Peter Straughan - Pink Revisions. (27.01.2023) 57.
If this report ever existed, then I
think we can rest assured that it
has indeed been withdrawn. We have
done all that could be expected of
us.
He locks the filing cabinet.
EXT. VATICAN GROUNDS - FOUNTAIN - NIGHT69 69
The two are walking back towards the Casa Santa Marta.
Lawrence spots Benitez standing by a FOUNTAIN staring into
the water.
LAWRENCE
You go on, Ray.
He walks down a flight of stairs to app roach Benitez who is
gazing into a pool with swimming TURTLES.
LAWRENCE (CONT’D)
The Holy Father’s turtles. He was
very fond of them. A gift from
Angola.
Benitez looks up with delight.
BENITEZ
I thought for a moment I was
imagining them... Where I come
from, they are considered very
special animals. They symbolise
healing and transformation.
LAWRENCE
Well, here they keep escaping and
being run over. We should go back -
the evening curfew.
EXT. VATICAN GROUNDS - NIGHT69A 69A
Lawrence and Benitez walk back towards the Casa.
LAWRENCE
How are you bearing up? Your
health?
Benitez seems to tense a little at the question.
BENITEZ
My health is excellent, thank you.
LAWRENCE (CONT’D)
CONCLAVE by Peter Straughan - Pink Revisions. (27.01.2023) 58.
LAWRENCE
Oh, I only meant have you recovered
from your journey?
BENITEZ
I have indeed.
LAWRENCE
Good. And I noticed in the Sistine
that you found someone to vote for?
BENITEZ
(A shy smile)
Yes. I voted for you.
(Off his stricken
expression)
Forgive me! Am I not supposed to
say?
LAWRENCE
No, it’s not... I’m honoured,
but...My dear Vincent - may
I call you Vincent? - I’m not a
serious candidate. My vocation lies
in a different...
He struggles to think of a suitable term, then finds himself,
to his own surprise, continuing...
LAWRENCE (CONT’D)
After the conclave, I hope to
resign as Dean and to leave Rome
altogether. So, you see, I...
BENITEZ
Why?
Lawrence is wrong-footed.
LAWRENCE
I have been experiencing some...
difficulties...
BENITEZ
With your faith?
LAWRENCE
Prayer. I...
He trails off, embarrassed.
CONCLAVE by Peter Straughan - Pink Revisions. (27.01.2023) 59.
BENITEZ
(Understanding)
“I cry out to You, God but You do
not answer.”
Lawrence shifts uncomfortably - why did he tell him?
LAWRENCE
I only mention it to illustrate my
point that I am in no way worthy to
be Pope.
BENITEZ
Any man who is truly worthy must
consider himself unworthy. Isn’t
that the point you were making in
your homily? That without doubt
there can be no faith? It resonated
with my own exper ience. In my
ministry I have witnessed scenes
which would make any man skeptical
of God’s mercy.
LAWRENCE
(Trying again)
You received a vote yourself didn’t
you?
BENITEZ
I did. It was absurd.
LAWRENCE
Then imagine how you would feel if
I insisted on voting for you and by
some miracle you won.
BENITEZ
(Solemnly)
It would be a disaster for the
Church.
LAWRENCE
That is how it would be if I became
Pope. Think a bout what I’m asking.
He squeezes his shoulder again and they walk on.
INT. CASA SANTA MARTA - PAPAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT70 70
Lawrence walks along the corridor. He slows as he sees the
entrance to the Papal suite, still criss-crossed with
ribbons.
CONCLAVE by Peter Straughan - Pink Revisions. (27.01.2023) 60.
On tables on either side of the door, dozens of votive
candles flicker. Bellini stands before them, looking lost in
thought. Lawrence approaches.
LAWRENCE
Aldo, I feel wretched that my
meagre tally may have come at your
expense.
He waits for his friend to look at him but Bellini continues
to stare at the door. Then...
BELLINI
I had no idea you were so
ambitious.
LAWRENCE
(Stung)
That’s a ridiculous thing to say.
Bellini turns to him.
BELLINI
Is it...? I thought we had your
support. If we liberals are not
united then Tedesco will become
Pope! You don’t know how bad it
became, Thomas. The way he and his
circle attacked the Holy Father
towards the end? The smears, the
leaks to the press. It was
savage... He fought him every day
of his pontificate and now that
he’s dead he wants to destroy his
life’s w ork. If Tedesco wins he
will undo sixty years of progress!
Lawrence feels his own temper rising.
LAWRENCE
You talk as if you were the only
alternative, Aldo. Adeyemi has the
wind behind him...
BELLINI
Adeyemi? A man who believes
homosexuals should be sent to
prison in this world and hell in
the next? Adeyemi isn’t the answer
to anything and you know it! If you
want to defeat...
CONCLAVE by Peter Straughan - Pink Revisions. (27.01.2023) 61.
LAWRENCE
“Defeat?” This is a Conclave, Aldo.
You talk as if it’s a war.
BELLINI
Because it is a war! And you have
to commit to a side! Save your
famous doubts for your prayers!
This knocks the wind out of Lawrence. Neither can quite
believe that they’re talking to each other like this.
Lawrence tries again, quietly, urgently...
LAWRENCE
For God’s sake, you cannot
seriously believe I have the
slightest d esire to become Pope?
BELLINI
(Dismissing this
contemptuously)
Oh, every cardinal has that desire!
Every cardinal, deep down inside,
has already chosen the name by
which he would like his papacy to
be known!
LAWRENCE
Well, I haven’t!
BELLINI
Deny it if you like. But search
your heart and then tell me it
isn’t so.
He walks away leaving a distressed Lawrence staring after
him.
INT. CASA SANTA MARTA - LAWRE NCE'S ROOM - NIGHT71 71
Lawrence kneels by his bed, in prayer. His eyes stray to the
bed itself, anonymous and bland, the padded headboard, a
faint echo of a similar moment...
But before he can locate the memory his exhaustion overcomes
him. His eyelids flutter, close and slowly he begins to sink
forward into sleep...
INT. PAPAL BEDROOM - NIGHT71A 71A
A DREAM IMAGE
CONCLAVE by Peter Straughan - Pink Revisions. (27.01.2023) 62.
Lawrence straightens, still kneeling by a bed. The LATE POPE
lies before him, just as at the opening of the film.
But now his eyes are open and he stares at Lawrence. A
charged moment. Something vital is about to be said. Lawrence
leans in a little.
The Pope opens his mouth to speak and...
INT. CASA SANTA MARTA - LAWRENCE'S ROOM - NIGHT72 72
... Lawrence wakes in the darkness, hears a muffled
conversation, hushed and urgent. A man’s baritone. Then, in
reply... a woman’s voice.
Lawrence reaches out a fumbling hand and switches on the
light. Gingerly he straightens up from where he had fallen
asleep, slumped over the bed, his joints in agony. He wonders
if he dreamed the voice. He checks the clock: 2.55am.
Silence. Then he hears it again - a woman’s voice, raised,
accusatory, Adeyemi’s low reply. He pushes against the bed,
standing slowly, the un-oiled springs squeak loud ly.
He tiptoes across the room and listens at the wall but the
voices have fallen silent. After a moment he hears the low
rumble of Adeyemi’s voice again, followed by the click of a
door closing.
He hurries to his own door and opens it...
INT. CASA SANTA MARTA - CORRIDOR - NIGHT72A 72A
Lawrence peers out into the corridor, just in time to see a
flash of the blue uniform as it disappears around the corner .
He stands undecided for a moment, then quietly closes the
door and...
INT. CASA SANTA MARTA - LAWRENCE’S ROOM - NIGHT72B 72B
... sits on his bed, mind whirring.
TITLE CARD: SECOND DAY OF CONCLAVE
EXT. CASA SANTA MARTA - COURTYARD - MORNING73 73
The sea of cardinals mill around the courtyard, ready for the
second day of the Conclave. Lawrence, bleary-eyed from his
broken night, sees O’Malley approach.
CONCLAVE by Peter Straughan - Pink Revisions. (27.01.2023) 63.
MONSIGNOR O'MALLEY
Good morning, Your Eminence. Did
you sleep well?
LAWRENCE
Perfectly, thank you.
MONSIGNOR O'MALLEY
The buses are ready.
Lawrence notices Bellini in the throng, watching him.
LAWRENCE
I think I’ll walk.
EXT. VATICAN GARDENS - MORNING74 74
Lawrence walks, aware of the inevitable SECURITY MAN trailing
him and the crackle of his walkie-talkie. From the sky above
comes the drone of circling heli copters. A gust of wind
almost takes Lawrence’s zucchetto.
LAWRENCE
(Under his breath)
Oh, do go away.
Moments later a figure appears at his side - Adeyemi.
ADEYEMI
Good morning, Dean.
LAWRENCE
Joshua.
They walk in uncomfortable silence for a moment.
ADEYEMI
I want you to know that I very much
agreed with your homily yesterday.
Lawrence looks at him in surprise.
ADEYEMI (CONT’D)
We are all tested in our faith,
Dean. W e all lapse. But the
Christian faith is, above all, a
message of forgiveness.
LAWRENCE
And tolerance.
CONCLAVE by Peter Straughan - Pink Revisions. (27.01.2023) 64.
ADEYEMI
Exactly. Tolerance. I trust that
when this election is over, your
moderating voice will be heard in
the very highest counsels of the
Church. It certainly will be if I
have anything to do with it. The
very highest counsels.
CARDINAL NAKITANDA (O.S.)
Joshua!
ADEYEMI
Excuse me, Dean.
He falls back to talk to two of the African cardinals walking
behind them. Lawrence walks on, wondering if Adeyemi has just
offered him the position of Secretary of State as a bribe.
INT. SISTINE CHAPEL - MORNING75 75
Pencils scratch the names of cardinals on ballot papers...
Elderly cardinals labour down the aisle, ballots held aloft
in shaking hands...
Ballot papers are dropped into the urn...
A needle pierces a ballot paper with scarlet thread...
Cardinal Lombardi leans into the microphone.
CARDINAL LOMBARDI
(Italian )
< The results of the second

CARDINAL LOMBARDI (CONT’D)
Cardinale Benítez: due voti.
Cardinali a cui è stato

CONCLAVE by Peter Straughan - Pink Revisions. (27.01.2023) 65.
Lawrence stands and walks to the microphone, aware of the
whispered conversations around him.
LAWRENCE
(Italian)
< My brothers, in accordance
with the Apostolic
Constitution, we will not
stop to burn the ballot
papers at this point, but
instead proceed immediately
to the next vote... >

INT. SISTINE CHAPEL - MORNING / LATER76 76
Again...
Pencils scratch the names of cardinals on ballot papers...
Elderly cardinals labour down the aisle, ballots held aloft
in shaking hands...
Ballot papers are dropped into the urn...
A needle pierces a ballot paper with scarlet thread...
Lawrence holds his pen, tip down, on his desk, waiting for
the results. Cardinal Lombardi leans into the microphone.
CARDINAL LOMBARDI
(Italian)
< The results of the third
ballot are... Cardinal
Adeyemi: fifty-two votes...>
CARDINAL LOMBARDI
I risultati del terzo
scrutinio sono i seguenti.
Cardinale Adeyemi:

Lawrence glances at Adeyemi. The Nigerian has his head sunk
on his chest in prayer.
CARDINAL LOMBARDI (CONT’D)
< ...Cardinal Tedesco: thirty
votes. Cardinal... >
CARDINAL LOMBARDI (CONT’D)
...Cardinale Tedesco: trenta
voti. Cardinale...
The pen in his hand suddenly vibrates. A faint tremor runs
through the sound-proofed chamber. Lombardi, feeling it,
hesitates. The rows of cardinals stir. Lombardi, puzzled,
looks to Lawrence, who frowns, nods him to continue...
CONCLAVE by Peter Straughan - Pink Revisions. (27.01.2023) 66.

INT. CASA SANTA MARTA - KITCHEN CORRIDOR - DAY77 77
Two NUNS stand at a window, staring out at the city beyond. A
sinister thread of black smoke is rising from somewhere in
the east, on the Quirinal Hill. Distantly we hear the sound
of sirens wailing. One of the Nuns clasps her hands and
begins to pray in a low, urgent murmur. Sister Agnes appears
behind them. They glance at her nervously, but from her look
understand they are to continue.
INT. SALA REGIA - DAY78 78
Lawrence walks with O’Malley. Two SECU RITY MEN hurry past
them.
LAWRENCE
(Quietly)
I take it something has happened?
MONSIGNOR O’MALLEY
There’s been an explosion your
Eminence. In the Piazza Barberini.
LAWRENCE
Dear God. A bomb?
MONSIGNOR O’MALLEY
It’s unclear at this moment. There
are injuries but no talk of
fatalities so far.
Lawrence considers for a moment.
LAWRENCE
Say nothing to the cardinal-
electors about this Ray. We are
sequestered and t hey must be
shielded from any news of the
outside world in case it influences
their judgement. You understand?
MONSIGNOR O’MALLEY
Of course your Eminence.
CONCLAVE by Peter Straughan - Pink Revisions. (27.01.2023) 67.
They walk on in silence.
INT. CASA SANTA MARTA - DINING ROOM - DAY79 79
The cardinals at lunch. Some surreptitiously look to the
windows, searching the skies for the dispersing veil of
distant smoke.
Lawrence comes with a plate from the buffet, hesitates, then
takes a seat at Bellini’s table. The two men avoid each
other’s gaze. The other cardinals continue their stilted
conversation - everyone aware that something has happened in
the outside world.
CARDINAL VILLANUEVA
Well, it would seem that Adeyemi
will be Pope before the day is out.
No-one answers for a moment.
CARDINAL VILLANUEVA (CONT’D)
I suppose the first black Pope will
be a tremendous thing for the
world.
CARDINAL SABBADIN
What am I supposed to tell them in
Milan when they start to discover
our new Pope’s social views?
Lawrence is suddenly awar e of a Cardinal at his shoulder. It
is Guttoso.
GUTTOSO
(Quietly, Italian)
< Dean, this morning’s
incident. Have you heard
any...? >
GUTTOSO
(Quietly)
Decano, l'incidente di
stamattina. Avete sentito
qualcosa ...?
LAWRENCE
(Interrupting, Italian)
< Your Eminence, we are
sequestered. >
LAWRENCE
(Interrupting, Italian)
Eminenza, siamo in
isolamento.
GUTTOSO
< Of course, but as a Roman
myself... >
GUTTOSO
Certo, ma essendo io stesso
romano...
CONCLAVE by Peter Straughan - Pink Revisions. (27.01.2023) 68.
LAWRENCE
(Firmly)
< I’m sorry. Paragraph four
of the Apostolic Constitution
is quite clear. >
LAWRENCE
(Firmly)
Mi dispiace. Il quarto
paragrafo della Costituzione
Apostolica è piuttosto chiaro
in proposito.
Guttoso hesitates then, disgruntled, nods and walks away.
Lawrence turns back to the table aware that the others have
been listening. There is a beat of embarrassed silence. Then
Bellini steps in, a s if there had been no interruption.
BELLINI
Tell your congregation in Milan to
celebrate the first African pontiff
in the history of the Church.
CARDINAL SABBADIN
If Adeyemi was white we’d all be
condemning him as more reactionary
then Tedesco. It’s only because
he’s...
BELLINI
(Sharp)
Enough! It’s too late for this talk
now.
His eyes flick to Lawrence and away again.
BELLINI (CONT’D)
All too late.
Lawrence is n o longer listening. Under the chatter of the
room he is puzzled to discern a raised voice. Suddenly there
is a crash. He turns, in time to see a NUN hurrying back to
the kitchens, followed by two more SISTERS as Adeyemi leaves
his table and heads out of the room.
LAWRENCE
What happened?
Beside him, Landolfi shrugs, disinterested.
CARDINAL LANDOLFI
She dropped a bottle of wine.
No-one is paying much attention. A Nun appears with mop and
bucket to clear up the mess. Lawrence looks at Adeyemi’s
empty chair.
CONCLAVE by Peter Straughan - Pink Revisions. (27.01.2023) 69.
INT. CASA SANTA MARTA - DINING ROOM BUFFET - DAY80 80
Lawrence stands getting coffee. He turns and finds three of
the African Cardinals behind him, their expressions mournful.
And his heart sinks. For a moment he has a mad impulse to
flee. But...
CARDINAL NAKITANDA
May we have a word, Dean?
LAWRENCE
Of course.
CARDINAL NAKITANDA
Our brother Joshua is troubled.
LAWRENCE
What just happened?
The cardinals exchan ge glances.
CARDINAL NAKITANDA
One of the nuns serving our table
started talking to him. He tried to
ignore her and then she dropped her
tray and shouted something. He got
up and left.
LAWRENCE
What did she say to him?
CARDINAL NAKITANDA
We don’t know. She was speaking
Yoruba.
LAWRENCE
Where is Cardinal Adeyemi now?
Nakitanda shrugs, takes his arm.
CARDINAL NAKITANDA
Clearly something is wrong, Dean,
and he must tell us what. We have
waited a long time for an African
Pope. But he must be pure in heart
and conscience. Anything less would
be a disaster for us all.

CONCLAVE by Peter Straughan - Pink Revisions. (27.01.2023) 70.
INT. CASA SANTA MARTA - KITCHEN - DAY81A 81A
The kitchen is full of NUNS preparing food. Lawrence crosses
towards the back, looking for the missing nun. Those closest
to him bow their heads as he passes.
In the back the office is empty. Lawrence returns.
LAWRENCE
(Italian)
< Could you tell me, where is
the sister who just had the
accident? >
LAWRENCE
Potreste dirmi dove si trova
la sorella che ha fatto
cadere la bottiglia prima?
NUN

< She is with Sister Agnes,

NUN
È con Suor Agnes, Vostra
Eminenza.
LAWRENCE
< Would you be kind enough to
take me to her? >
LAWRENCE
Sareste così gentile da
portarmi da lei?
The Nun begins to lead him back to the dining room.
LAWRENCE (CONT’D)
< Is there a rear exit we can
use? >
LAWRENCE (CONT’D)
C'è un'uscita posteriore che
possiamo usare?
INT. CASA SANTA MARTA - OUTSIDE BAC K OFFICE - DAY82 82
The Nun knocks on the door of the office. There is no reply.
Lawrence steps forward and knocks more loudly. After a
moment, the door opens a little and SISTER AGNES peers out.
LAWRENCE
Good afternoon, Sister. I need to
speak to the nun who dropped her
tray just now.
SISTER AGNES
She is safe with me, Your Eminence.
I am dealing with the situation.
LAWRENCE
I am sure you are Sister Agnes. But
I must see her myself.
SISTER AGNES
I hardly think a dropped tray
should concern the Dean of the
College of Cardinals.
CONCLAVE by Peter Straughan - Pink Revisions. (27.01.2023) 71.
LAWRENCE
Even so...
He grips the door handle. Amazed, he finds that as he pushes,
she resists.
SISTER AGNES
The welfare of the Sister is my
responsibility, Dean.
An impasse as both stare at each other.
LAWRENCE
(Icy)
And this Conclave is mine.
Beat. Finally she stands aside.
INT. CASA SANTA MARTA - BACK OFFICE - DAY83 83
The NUN - a plump middle-aged Nigerian woman - sits in a
corner of the office. She sta nds as Lawrence enters.
LAWRENCE
Please, sit, my child. My name is
Cardinal Lawrence. How are you
feeling?
SISTER AGNES
She’s feeling much better.
LAWRENCE
(To the Nun)
Could you tell me your name?
SISTER AGNES
Her name is Shanumi.
LAWRENCE
(To the Nun)
Please, do sit down.
SISTER AGNES
Eminence, I really do think it
would be better if...
LAWRENCE
(Without looking at her)
Would you be so good as to leave us
now, S ister Agnes?
CONCLAVE by Peter Straughan - Pink Revisions. (27.01.2023) 72.
She opens her mouth to protest again but Lawrence turns and
stares at her with a look of such freezing authority that she
finally bows her head and walks out of the room, closing the
door after her. Lawrence sits, facing SISTER SHANUMI.
LAWRENCE (CONT’D)
Sister Shanumi, I want you to
understand, first of all, that you
are not in any sort of trouble. The
fact of the matter is, I have a
responsibility before God to make
sure that the decisions we make
here are the right ones. Now it’s
important that you tell me anything
that is in your heart and that is
troubling you in so far as it
relates to Cardinal Adeyemi. Can
you do that for me.
Shanumi stares at the floor, shakes her head.
LAWRENCE (CONT’D)
Even if I give you absolute
assurance that it will go no
further than this room?
Again, she shakes her head. Lawrence sits, at a loss. Then,
inspiration strikes. He leans towards her again.
LAWRENCE (CONT’D)
Would you like me to hear your
confession?
INT. CASA SANTA MARTA - CORRIDOR - DAY84 84
TRACKING with Lawrence as he walks determinedly down the
corridor.
He reaches the door of Adeyemi’s room - the room next to his
own and knocks. After a moment Adeyemi opens the door, drying
his face.
ADEYEMI
I’ll be ready in a moment, Dean.
He walks back into the room. Lawrence hesitates, then follows
him...
CONCLAVE by Peter Straughan - Pink Revisions. (27.01.2023) 73.
INT. CASA SANTA MARTA - ADEYEMI’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS85 85
Adeyemi is in the bathroom. We hear the steady stream of
urination, followed by the flush. He walks out, buttoning his
cassock, seems surprised to find LAWRENCE there.
ADEYEMI
Shouldn’t we be leaving?
LAWRENCE
In a moment.
ADEYEMI
That sounds ominous.
(Studying himself in the
mirror)
If this is about the incident
downstairs, I have no desire to
talk about it.
Lawrence watches in silence, waiting him out. Adeyemi turns
from the mirror and walks past Lawrence into the room.
ADEYEMI (CONT’D)
I am the victim of a disgraceful
plot to ruin my reputation. Someone
brought that woman here and staged
this melodrama. She’d never left
Nigeria before and suddenly she is
here in the Casa Santa Marta?
LAWRENCE
With respect, Joshua, how she came
here is secondary to the issue of
your relationship with her.
ADEYEMI
(turning)
I have no relationship to her! I
hadn’t set eyes on her for thirty
years until she turned up outside
my room last night!
He catches himself.
ADEYEMI (CONT’D)
It was...it was...
(Helplessly)
A lapse, Dean. A lapse! “Let God
grant us a Pope who sins and asks
forgiveness, and carries on.” Your
words!
CONCLAVE by Peter Straughan - Pink Revisions. (27.01.2023) 74.
LAWRENCE
And have you asked forgiveness?
ADEYEMI
I confessed my sin at the time! My
bishop moved me to another parish
and I never lapsed again! Such
relationships were not uncommon in
those days. You know that!
LAWRENCE
(Quietly)
And the child?
Adeyemi flinches.
ADEYEMI
The child? The child was brought up
in a Christian household, and to
this day he has no idea who his
father is - if indeed it is me.
That is the child.
For a moment the two men stare at each other in silence,
Adeyemi’s jaw jutted in defiance. Then something in him
crumbles. He sits on the bed.
ADEYEMI (CONT’D)
(Beat. Broken)
We were very young.
LAWRENCE
No, Your Eminence. She was very
young. Nineteen years old. You were
thirty.
ADEYEMI
Thomas, please... Listen to me. I
sensed the presence of the Holy
Spirit this morning. I swear it. I
am ready to t ake this burden. Does
a single mistake thirty years ago
disqualify me? I was a different
man! I beg you, please don’t use
this to ruin me.
LAWRENCE
(sadly)
Joshua...the thought is not worthy
of you. The woman will not speak of
this to protect her son, and I am
bound by the vows of the
confessional.
CONCLAVE by Peter Straughan - Pink Revisions. (27.01.2023) 75.
Adeyemi looks up at him.
ADEYEMI
So... I still have hope?
Lawrence hesitates, hating this duty. He steps closer, taking
Adeyemi’s hands in his.
LAWRENCE
(Gently)
No, Joshua. There is no hope. After
such a public scene, there will be
rumours. And you know what the
Curia is like. Nothing terrifies
our colleagues more than the
thought of yet more sexual
scandals.
Adeyemi’s eyes prick with tears.
LAWRENCE (CONT’D)
( Moved)
I am more sorry than I can say. You
will never be Pope. You must begin
again.
He bends closer, grips the Nigerian’s hands tighter.
LAWRENCE (CONT’D)
(Fiercely)
But you are a good man. And you
will find a way to atone.
A long beat. Adeyemi nods blindly, disengages his hands to
wipe his eyes. He breathes deeply, gathers himself.
ADEYEMI
Will you...will you pray with me?
Beat. Lawrence holds out a hand, hel ps the Nigerian sink to
his knees then joins him. They pray.
EXT. VATICAN GARDENS - DAY86 86
HIGH ANGLE

through the formal geometries of the gardens. He joins
Nakitanda and his two colleagues on a seat. We watch them
talk for a moment. Nakitanda drops his head in dismay.
CONCLAVE by Peter Straughan - Pink Revisions. (27.01.2023) 76.
INT. SISTINE CHAPEL - DAY87 87
The Fourth and Fifth Ballots in progress. We’re watching
Adeyemi walk down the aisle, his ballot held high in his
hand. He passes the seats of the African Cardinals who, to a
man, avert their eyes. He reaches the microphone.
ADEYEMI
(Solemnly, in Latin)
< I call as my witness Christ
the Lord, who will be my
judge, that my vote is given
to the one who before God I
think sho uld be elected. >
ADEYEMI
(Solemnly)
Testor Christum Dominum, qui
me iudicaturus est, me eum
eligere, quem secundum Deum
iudico eligi debere.
Lawrence sits, marvelling at the man’s dignity in the face of
his ruined life.
He turns back to his own ballot paper. A beat. Reluctantly,
he writes: Bellini.
- Cardinals shuffle down the aisle, ballots held up in
shaking hands...
- Ballots are dropped into the Ur n...
- High above, the Last Judgement lies cloaked in darkness...

his colleagues twist in their seats to examine the new front-

CONCLAVE by Peter Straughan - Pink Revisions. (27.01.2023) 77.
You can feel the electric tension in the room now - a
staggering haemorrhage of Adeyemi’s followers. In a sea of
scratching pencils, the Nigerian sits staring at the wall
ahead, as if oblivious.
CARDINAL LOMBARDI (CONT’D)
(Italian)
< Cardinal Benitez, four
votes. >
CARDINAL LOMBARDI (CONT’D)
Cardinal Benítez: quattro
voti.
Lawrence sits, horribly aware of being an object of curiosity
for the cardinals around him, who a re registering his
increased share of votes. He can’t stop himself looking to
Bellini and finds the cardinal’s cold gaze upon him.
LOMBARDI
(Italian)
< My brothers, that concludes
the fifth ballot. No
candidate having achieved the
necessary majority, we shall
resume voting tomorrow

LOMBARDI

INT. SISTINE CHAPEL - VESTIBULE - EVENING89 89
The chapel has emptied. O’Malley bundles the ballots into the
stove and burns them. He crosses the vestibule and turns to
where Lawrence sits in the chapel, lost in thought, picks up
his clipboard of notes.
LAWRENCE
(Noticing)
Yes, Ray?
MONSIGNOR O’MALLEY
The incident this morning, your
Eminence. I have more information,
if...?
Lawrence considers, finally shakes his head.
LAWRENCE
No, Ray. I too must be shielded
from any knowledge which could act
as an...interference in the process
of this Conclave.
MONSIGNOR O’MALLEY
(Bowing)
Of course, Eminence.
CONCLAVE by Peter Straughan - Pink Revisions. (27.01.2023) 78.
LAWRENCE
Anything else?
O’Malley glances at his clipboard.
MONSIGNOR O’MALLEY
Uhh...Oh, Cardinal Benitez. His
health problems? He was issued with
a return ticket to Geneva, paid for
from the Pope’s own account. I
checked the visa application. The
purpose for travel was given as
“medical treatment.” Anyway,
whatever it was, it can’t have been
serious. The tickets were
cancelled. He never went.
Lawrence nods, barely listening.
LAWRENCE
Alright. Thank you, Ray.
O’Malley lingers. Lawrence gives him a questioning look.
MONSIGNOR O'MALLEY
(Hesitantly)
Forgive me. I know you said we
should forget the matter of the
withdrawn report but...I wondered
in light of Cardinal Tremblay’s
present...position? I could see if
there was anything more I could
find out?
Lawrence feels a flush of anger.
LAWRENCE
I’m not a Wi tchfinder. It isn’t my
job to go hunting for secrets in my
colleagues’ pasts!
O’Malley nods, taken aback. Beat. Lawrence relents, touches
O’Malley’s wrist.
LAWRENCE (CONT’D)
I’m sorry, Ray. No more
investigations. I think we’ve heard
enough secrets.
(Standing)
Let God’s Will be done.
MONSIGNOR O'MALLEY
Good night then, Your Eminence.
CONCLAVE by Peter Straughan - Pink Revisions. (27.01.2023) 79.
He watches the older man walk away.
INT. CASA SANTA MARTA - LAWRENCE'S ROOM - NIGHT90 90
Lawrence sits on his bed, struggling to unlace his shoes. He
manages to remove one and has to pause to regain his breath.
A KNOCK at the door jerks him upright and startled. He
crosses to the door and opens it to reveal Bellini and
Sabbadin outside.
BELLINI
Thomas.
INT. CASA SANTA MARTA - BACK STAIRS - NIGHT91 91
Lawrence , Bellini and Sabbadin stand in a staircase.
CARDINAL SABBADIN
(Hushed)
We need to decide how we are going
to proceed.
Lawrence glances around at the shadowy staircase. This feels
absurd.
LAWRENCE
Is this really necessary? I feel as
if I’m at some American political
convention.
CARDINAL SABBADIN
(Gloomily)
Well, it isn’t going to take long.
Our friend here does not have
sufficient support amongst our
colle agues to be elected Pope.
LAWRENCE
It isn’t over yet.
Bellini stirs.
BELLINI
(Heavily)
I’m afraid, as far as I’m
concerned, it is. The question
arises, if I can’t win, whom should
I advise my supporters to vote for?
He clears his throat. An awkward beat.
CONCLAVE by Peter Straughan - Pink Revisions. (27.01.2023) 80.
BELLINI (CONT’D)
Obviously there is you. But...
CARDINAL SABBADIN
(Bluntly)
But you can’t win either. Even if
we delivered you all of Aldo’s
fifteen votes - which I don’t
believe we could - you’d still be
in third place, behind Tremblay and
Tedesco. No-one has enough traction
to catch either of the front-
runners. So, since we all agree
that Tedesco would be a disaster...
He spreads his hands. The three stand i n silence for a
moment.
BELLINI
I’m no more of an enthusiast for
Tremblay than you are, Thomas. But
we have to face the fact that--
A few stories below a door creaks, footsteps on marble echo
throughout the staircase. Bellini peers over the banister at
a cardinal in conversation below. He continues, lowering his
voice.
BELLINI (CONT’D)
He has demonstrated a broad appeal.
(Without much conviction)
Perhaps he wi ll be a unifying
force?
Lawrence shakes his head.
BELLINI (CONT’D)
What?
LAWRENCE
Is this what we are reduced to?
Considering the “least-worst”
option?
BELLINI
(Irritated)
The field has narrowed. If we don’t
change our votes, we’ll be here for
weeks. Which is what Tedesco wants.
CONCLAVE by Peter Straughan - Pink Revisions. (27.01.2023) 81.
LAWRENCE
(Beat)
I have been informed that, shortly
before his death, the Holy Father
had fallen out with Tremblay. In
fact, that he intended to dismiss
him from all offices in the Church.
The two stare at him, stunned.
LAWRENCE (CONT’D)
There is a rumour of a report of
some kind, a report that was
possibly withdrawn...
Sabbadin glances nervously at Bellini, who frowns.
BELLINI
A rumour?
(Beat)
Thomas, in the la st weeks of his
life it is possible that the Holy
Father was not entirely himself. He
had become increasingly secretive
and paranoid...
CARDINAL SABBADIN
(Joining in)
Even if there was a report...
They turn to look at him.
CARDINAL SABBADIN (CONT’D)
What I mean is...We’ve had a Pope
who was in the Hitler Youth and
fought for the Nazis. We’ve had
Popes accused of colluding with
communists and fascists. We’ve had
Popes who have ignored reports of
the most appalling sexual abuse of
children...
BELLINI
(Impatient)
We take the point...
CARDINAL SABBADIN
The point is - we will never find a
candidate who doesn’t have some
kind of black mark against them! We
are mortal men! We serve an ideal -
we cannot always be ideal.
CONCLAVE by Peter Straughan - Pink Revisions. (27.01.2023) 82.
Beat. Lawrence looks at his friend, but Bellini avoids his
gaze.
BELLINI
(Flat)
So we’re agreed. We urge all our
supporters to back Tremblay.
The three stand in silence - the gloom of realpolitik
descending upon them.
INT. CASA SANTA MARTA - LIFT - NIGHT92 92
Lawrence stands lost in thought as the elevator rises. It
stops at a floor and the doors slide open.
The ancient Cardinal LOWENSTEIN, grey-faced wi th fatigue,
leaning on his walking stick, creeps slowly into the lift.
Lawrence bites down on his impatience, flashes a smile,
holding the door for his elderly colleague.
On the landing beyond a door opens and Tedesco and Adeyemi
emerge from a room.
Adeyemi and Lawrence lock gazes. The Nigerian’s former sorrow
and remorse seems to have passed, to be replaced by a look of
defiance, almost hostility. Then he turns away, following the
Patriarch of Venice.
OMITTED92A 92A
INT. CASA SANTA MARTA - LIFT - NIGHT92B 92B
The doors slide closed again and the elevator continues its
ascent. For a moment the only sound is Lowenstein’s laboured
breathing. Then...
CARDIN AL LOWENSTEIN
If this drags on much longer I
might die before we find a new
Pope.
Lawrence is still thinking about what he’s just seen - the
formation of a new right-wing voting block?
LAWRENCE
(Grimly)
Then let’s try to finish it.
CONCLAVE by Peter Straughan - Pink Revisions. (27.01.2023) 83.
INT. CASA SANTA MARTA - UPPER CORRIDOR - NIGHT93 93
A door opens a little and Benitez peers cautiously out at us,
his open cassock clutched together at his throat.
BENITEZ
Your Eminence?
Lawrence is a little taken aback by Benitez’ wariness.
LAWRENCE
I’m sorry to disturb you. May I
have a word?
BENITEZ
Of course. One moment.
To Thomas' surprise, Benitez disappears back into the room,
leaving him standing in the corridor. After a moment he
reappears, clothed now.
BENITEZ (CONT’D)
(Ushering him in)
Excuse me, at this time of day I
always try to meditate for an
hour...
INT. CASA SANTA MARTA - BENITEZ ROOM - CONTINUOUS94 94
Lawrence takes in the room - identical to his own, except for
a few lit candles here and the bathroom beyond.
BENITEZ
(Apologetically)
In my travels I became used to not
always having electricity. Now I
find it helpful when I pray alone.
LAWRENCE
(Politely)
I must see if it helps me.
BENITEZ
Yes. Your difficulty with prayer.
He watches Lawrence, the same keen gaze. Lawrence nods.
CONCLAVE by Peter Straughan - Pink Revisions. (27.01.2023) 84.
BENITEZ (CONT’D)
(Gently)
If I may say... sometimes I find,
instead of speaking, I have to
become silent. And in the silence
wait for God to be heard.
For a moment Lawrence feels affronted - is he, the Dean, to
be given lessons in prayer now? But he fights it down.
LAWRENCE
Yes. I’m sure you’re right.
BENITEZ
Excuse me...
He sits and starts to tie his shoes.
LAWRENCE
The other night you were kind
enough to say yo u had voted for me.
I don’t know if you’ve continued to
do so, but if you have I would like
to repeat my plea to you to stop.
BENITEZ
Why?
LAWRENCE
First, because I lack the spiritual
depth to be Pope. And secondly I
can’t possibly win. A long drawn
out Conclave would be seen by the
media as proof that the Church is
in crisis.
BENITEZ
You have come to ask me to vote for
Cardinal Tremblay?
LAWRENCE
Yes. A nd to urge your supporters to
do the same.
BENITEZ
Cardinal Tremblay has already
spoken to me about this.
LAWRENCE
(Bitterly)
I’m sure he has.
CONCLAVE by Peter Straughan - Pink Revisions. (27.01.2023) 85.
He regrets his tone instantly. Benitez studies him solemnly.
BENITEZ
You want me to vote for a man you
see as ambitious?
LAWRENCE
I do not want to see Tedesco as
Pope. He would take the Church back
to an earlier era.
BENITEZ
I’m sorry. I cannot vote for a man
unless he is the one I deem most
worthy to be Pope. And for me, that
is not Cardinal Tremblay. It is
you.
Lawrence strikes the side of his seat in frustration.
LAWRENCE
I don’t want your vote!
Benitez stares back at him calmly, and once more Lawrence
senses a surprising strength of character in this frail man.
BENITEZ
(Calmly)
Never the less, you have it.
He walks towards the bathroom, blowing out a few candles.
Lawrence watches for a moment and then sighs. He wets thumb
and forefinger and snuffs out the candle beside the bed. As
he does he stares, distracted, at the little razor, out of
place in the bedroom, still in its cellophane wrapper. And
wonders why he has noted this.
OMITTED95 95
INT. CASA SANTA MARTA - DINING ROOM - NIGHT96 96
Tedesco sits, holding court with his supporters. Adeyemi and
the African cardinals sit with him now.
On the other side of the room, Tremblay circulates amongst
his supporters, shaking hands, exchanging a few remarks,
every inch the political campaigner.
Lawrence sits watching the two factions, sick at heart. His
gaze drifts to the blue-habited nuns moving between the
tables with trays and wine, eyes downcast.
CONCLAVE by Peter Straughan - Pink Revisions. (27.01.2023) 86.
On a sudden impulse, he stands.
INT. CASA SANTA MARTA - BACK OFFICE - NIGHT97 97
Lawrence sits with Sister Agnes, her eyes darting to the cage
with the canary.
SISTER AGNES
Sister Shanumi is on her way home
to Nigeria.
(Off Thomas' look)
There was a flight to Lagos this
evening. I thought it was best for
everyone if she was on it.
LAWRENCE
(Beat. Quietly)
How did Sister Shanumi come to be
in Rome?
SISTER AGN ES
I received notification from the
office of the Superioress General
that she would be joining us. The
arrangements were made in Paris.
You should ask the Rue de Bac, Your
Eminence.
LAWRENCE
I would, except that, as you know,
I am sequestered for the duration
of the Conclave.
SISTER AGNES
Then you can ask them afterwards.
LAWRENCE
The information is of value to me
now.
Sister Agnes stares at him, her i ndomitable gaze. She gets up
and checks on the bird which has been oddly silent.
LAWRENCE (CONT’D)
I know you were close to the late
Pope. When I tried to resign as
dean, the Holy Father wouldn’t let
me. I didn’t understand why at the
time. But now I think I understand.
I think he knew he was dying and
for some reason he wanted me to run
this Conclave. And that is what I’m
trying to do. For him.
CONCLAVE by Peter Straughan - Pink Revisions. (27.01.2023) 87.
Sister Agnes turns and stares at him in silence for a moment.
Then she puts her glasses on and turns to the computer on the
desk. She types rapidly, then stands and walks away, leaving
Lawrence to view the e-mail she has opened up. It is marked
October 3rd, Confidential. Lawrence's gaze is drawn to the
last paragraph...
“...I would be grateful if you could take particular care of
our sister, as her presence has been requested by the Prefect
of the Congregation for the Evangelisation of Peoples, His
Eminence, Cardinal Joseph Tremblay.”
Lawrence stares at the name.
INT. CASA SANTA MARTA - STAIRCASE - NIGHT98 98
After dinner Cardinals are heading for the stairs and
elevator. Tremblay amongst a group of acolytes.
LAWRENCE (O.S.)
Your Eminence, a word if I may?
Tremblay turns -- Lawrence stands on the st aircase above him,
waiting.
TREMBLAY
(Smiling)
I was just on my way to bed.
LAWRENCE
It won’t take a moment. Come.
Tremblay’s smile is suddenly wary as Lawrence leads him to...
EXT. CASA SANTA MARTA - COURTYARD CORRIDOR - NIGHT99 99
The corridor is empty and in semi-darkness. Tremblay and
Lawrence stand in the light of the fluorescents, their breath
pluming in the air.
TREMBLAY
(still smiling)
I know you enjoy mystery novels
Thomas but this is...
LAWRENCE
I want you to withdraw your name
from the next ballot.
Tremblay sighs, shakes his head with a sorrowful smile.
CONCLAVE by Peter Straughan - Pink Revisions. (27.01.2023) 88.
LAWRENCE (CONT’D)
You are not the right man to be
Pope.
TREMBLAY
Well, forty of our colleagues would
disagree with you, so...
LAWRENCE
Only because they don’t know you as
I do.
Tremblay looks genuinely shocked at the remark.
TREMBLAY
This is sad, Thomas. I shall pray
for you and...
LAWRENCE
(Over)
I know there was some kind of
report into your activities. I know
the Holy Father raised the matter
with you hours befo re he died and
that he dismissed you from all your
posts. And I know that, somehow,
you discovered Adeyemi’s surrender
to temptation thirty years ago and
arranged for the woman involved to
be brought to Rome, with the
express intention of destroying
Adeyemi’s chance of becoming Pope.
TREMBLAY
I deny that accusation.
LAWRENCE
You deny asking our Superioress to
transfer one of her sisters to
Rome?
TREMB LAY
No. I asked her - but not on my own
behalf.
LAWRENCE
On whose behalf, then?
TREMBLAY
The Holy Father’s.
Lawrence stares at him, staggered.
CONCLAVE by Peter Straughan - Pink Revisions. (27.01.2023) 89.
LAWRENCE
You would libel the Holy Father in
his own home?
TREMBLAY
It isn’t libel, it’s the truth! The
Holy Father gave me the name of a
sister and asked me to make a
private request to bring her to
Rome. I had no idea why. And you...
(Stepping closer)
You should be careful Thomas. Your
own ambition has not gone
unnoticed. This might be
seen as a tactic to blacken the
name of a rival.
LAWRENCE
That is a d espicable accusation.
TREMBLAY
Is it? I wonder if you really are
so very reluctant to have the
chalice passed to you!
He makes a visible effort to catch his anger.
TREMBLAY (CONT’D)
I shall pretend this conversation
never took place.
He walks away.
LAWRENCE
(After him, impotent
anger)
But it has taken place!
Across the courtyard a security guard smokes a cigarette.
Alone in the dark, Lawrence feels his uncomforta ble gaze upon
him.
INT. CASA SANTA MARTA - LAWRENCE'S ROOM - NIGHT100 100
The only source of light shining from the bathroom Lawrence
lies on his bed, praying. After a moment his eyes open and he
stares blindly ahead, hoping for some sign, some guidance...
The sound of Adeyemi’s snoring coming from next door.
Suddenly Lawrence sits up in bed, a decision forming in his
mind. He opens the drawer to his nigh tstand... taking the
pass key Sister Agnes had lent him.

At the end of the corridor the lift doors open, a silhouette
appearing in the hall. Lawrence silently walks down the empty
corridor.
In front of the papal suite the votive candles flicker in
their red glasses. The locked door is still criss-crossed
with red ribbons.
Lawrence stares at the door, building his courage. Then he
takes Sister Agne s’ pass key and unlocks the door. He
hesitates then pushes the door open, the wax seals cracking
free and the ribbons fluttering down...
Lawrence crosses himself and then steps into...
INT. PAPAL SUITE - NIGHT103 103
Lawrence fumbles on the light and stares around the familiar,
plain room, the few simple items of furniture: the blue
scalloped sofa and matching armchairs, the coffee table, the
prie-dieu.
IN T. PAPAL OFFICE - NIGHT103A 103A
Lawrence sits at the desk, takes the briefcase on his knee
and opens it. Inside is an electric razor, a tin of
peppermints and a battered copy of The Imitation of Christ by
Thomas à Kempis. An ancient bus-ticket acts as a book-mark.
Lawrence opens the book and finds a passage underlined:
“At the Day of Judgement we shall not be asked what we have
read but what we have done. ”
Lawrence stares at the words. They feel like encouragement, a
command almost, from the late Holy father.
Lawrence searches through the Pope’s desk, rooting through
the drawers... An empty spectacles case, a plastic bottle of
lens cleaner, a box of aspirin, a calculator, rubber bands...
He freezes, hearing FOOTSTEPS approach.

INT. PAPAL CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS103B 103B
SISTER AGNES is walking down the corridor. She slows, seeing
the broken seals of the papal suite and the light showing
beneath the door. She stops at the door, listening.
Then the LIGHT below the Papal Suite door switches off.
INT. PAPAL SUITE - CONTINUOUS103C 103C
Lawrence stands by the light switch in the darkness,
practically holding his breath - aware that someone is ju st

INT. OUTSIDE THE PAPAL SUITE - CONTINUOUS103D 103D
SISTER AGNES hesitates, her hand on the door handle,
considering who the intruder could be.
And suddenly she is certain that it is Lawrence on the other
side of the door.
A strange moment of connection.
Then TWO NUNS cross the corridor behind her, deep in
conversation in Italian, breaking the silence.
Agnes straightens up again and walks on down the corridor.

Lawrence waits in the dark, listening to her footsteps
recede. Then he switches the light back on.
INT. PAPAL BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER104 104
Lawrence enters, silhouetted in the door frame. The bed has
been strippe d.
He opens the wardrobe - a simple closet that has been
emptied of everything except two ghost-like cassocks that
hang from the rail. The sight of them makes his heart ache.
He turns to the bedside cabinet, kneels carefully and checks
the small drawer, but it’s empty.
On top of the cabinet lie the late Pope’s spectacles and
alarm clock, just as they were on the night the pope died.
CONCLAVE by Peter Straughan - Pink Revisions. (27.01.2023) 92.
The sight of them finally undoes Lawrence and leans his
elbows on the bed, his face in his hands, and is wracked by a
fit of dry sobbing.
Finally, he opens his eyes again, bleakly accepting that he
has given in to a fit of paranoid madness. He is about to
stand again when he finds himself staring at the headboard
with it’s pitifully frayed edge, the crack in the wood, as if
some implement had been forced into the join...
He reaches out a hand and pulls at the bottom corner of the
padded head-piece. It resists. With both hands now he pulls
harder, grunting with the effort...
The headboard inches out from its frame. The material on the
inside edge, normally hidden, has a frayed six inch slit down
it.
Tentatively Lawrence slips his fingers into the padded
interior.
When he withdraws them he his holding several FOLDED SHEETS
OF PAPER.

Lawrence stands sipping a glass of water. Bellini sits on the
bed, reading the sheets of paper.
LAWRENCE
It’s the report on the activities

prima facie case that he is guilty
of simony - an offence that is
stipulated in the Holy Scripture
as...
BELLINI

How do you know they didn’t use

LAWRENCE
Because I’ve seen their bank
statements.
BELLINI
Dear God.
Lawrence finds himself staring down at the small plastic
CHESS SET which Bellini had taken from the Pope’s apart ment;
the pieces still grouped in the unfinished final game.
LAWRENCE
Ours too. It would seem the Holy
Father was spying on all of us. I
don’t think he trusted anyone.
Bellini looks up from the sheets.
BELLINI
Where did you find these?
Lawrence is silent.
BELLINI (CONT’D)

You broke the seals?
LAWRENCE
What choice did I have? I suspected
Tremblay of bringing that poor

LAWRENCE
Then keep clear of this. Leave it

consequences and...
BELLINI
(Over)
You know who will gain most from
this? Tedesc o! The whole basis
of his candidacy is that the Holy
Father led the Church to disaster

reveal this report it isn’t
Tremblay’s reputation which will
suffer - it’s the Church’s.
Accusing the Curia of institutional
corruption...

INT. CASA SANTA MARTA - STORAGE ROOM - EARLY MORNING108 108
A sheet from the REPORT is placed on the photocopier plate.
The heading reads Strictly Confidential. The names of some
cardinals have been obliterated with pen.
Lawrence, bleary from a sleepless night, stands staring at
the array of settings. He presses a button. “Error” flashes
on the screen. Lawrence stares at the message, wondering if
it’s an obscure judgement...
SISTER AGNES (O.S.)
I’ll do that for you, Your
Eminence.
Started, Lawrence finds Sister Agnes behind him, watching him
with her unwavering gaze. She glances at the sheet, taking in
that heading. Lawrence waits, frozen.
SISTER AGNES (CONT’D)
How many copies do you require?
LAWRENCE
One hundred and eight.
A fractional hesitation. Then Sister Agnes nods and moves to
the copier...
INT. CASA SANTA MARTA - DINING ROOM - MORNING109 109
Sister Agnes walks from plate to plate, distributing large
brown envelopes. Cardinal Lawrence helps here the first
CARDINALS arrive and take their seats at the dining tables.
CONCLAVE by Peter Straughan - Pink Revisions. (27.01.2023) 96.
INT. CASA SANTA MARTA - DINING ROOM - MORNING / LATER110 110
The dining room is now full, the buzz of excited
conversation. Cardinals turn in their seats to stare at
Lawrence who sits, impassive, feeling strangely calm.
Sabbadin appears in front of him, tosses the report on the
table before him.
CARDINAL SABBADIN
(Hissing)
You have wasted this report! We
could have used it to control
Tremblay after he was elected Pope.
All you have done is strengthen
Tedesco.
He walks away before Lawrence can reply. Benitez sits at the
table beside him with bread and fruit.
BENITEZ
You should eat Dean.
Lawrence stares blindly at the food.
LAWRENCE
Did I do the right thing, Vincent?
BENITEZ
No one who follows their conscience
ever does wrong, Your Eminence.
The room falls suddenly silent as Tremblay appears, hair
immaculate , chin jutted. He strides towards Lawrence.
TREMBLAY
(Loudly)
You are responsible for this I
believe?
LAWRENCE
No, Your Eminence. You are.
TREMBLAY
(For the room)
This report is entirely mendacious!
It would never have seen the light
of day if you had not broken into
the Holy Father’s apartment to
remove it!
CONCLAVE by Peter Straughan - Pink Revisions. (27.01.2023) 97.
LAWRENCE
(Calmly)
If the report is mendacious then
why did the Holy Father, in his
last official act as Pope, ask you
to resign?
A stir of amazement from the listening CARDINALS.
TREMBLAY
He did no such thing! As Monsignor
Morales, who was at the meeting
will confirm.
LAWRENCE
And yet Archbishop Wozniak insists
that the Holy Father told him
personally of the conversation...
TREMBLAY
(Over)
The Holy Father - may his name be
numbered among the high priests -
was a sick man towards the end of
his life as those of us who saw him
regularly will confirm!
TEDESCO
(Standing, Italian)
< If someone else may be
allowed to join this dialogue
- the names of eight
cardinals have been blacked
out. I assume the dean can
tell us who they are? Let
them confirm, here and now,
whether Cardinal Tremblay
requested their vot es in
return for the payment. >
TEDESCO
(Standing)
Se è possibile aggiungere
qualcun altro a questa
conversazione... i nomi di
otto cardinali sono stati
oscurati. Immagino che il
Decano possa dirci chi sono?
Lasciamo che siano loro a
confermare, qui ed ora, se il
Cardinal Tremblay ha
richiesto i loro voti in
cambio di soldi.
LAWRENCE
(Beat)
No. I won’t do that.
Uproar.
LAWRENCE (CONT’D)
(Almost drowned by the
comm otion)
Let each man examine his
conscience, as I have.

CONCLAVE by Peter Straughan - Pink Revisions. (27.01.2023) 98.
I have no desire to create
bitterness in this Conclave and
will be happy to stand down as
dean...
More uproar. At his table, Bellini watches his old friend
standing alone in the storm of voices, conflicted whether he
should come to his aid, when...
SISTER AGNES (O.S.)
Your Eminences... Your Eminences...
Gradually the words cut through and the cardinals turn to
stare at the small, resolute figure of Si ster Agnes standing
in their midst. A silence falls, perhaps out of shock at her
presumption.
SISTER AGNES (CONT’D)
Eminences, although we Sisters are
supposed to be invisible, God has
nevertheless given us eyes and
ears. I know what prompted the Dean
of the College to enter the Holy
Father’s rooms. He was concerned
that the sister from my order who
made that regrettable scene might
have been brought to Ro me with the
deliberate intention of
embarrassing a member of this
Conclave. His suspicions were
correct. She was indeed here at the
specific request of Cardinal
Tremblay.
She genuflects and then walks out, head held very erect.
Tremblay gapes after her in horror.
TREMBLAY
My brothers, it’s true the Holy
Father asked me to. I had no
knowledge of who she was - I swear
to you!
For a moment no-one speaks. Then Adeyemi stands and points a
finger at him.
ADEYEMI
Judas.
He turns and walks out and Tremblay finds the cardinals
staring at him, stony-faced.

INT. CASA SANTA MARTA - PRAYER ROOM - MORNING111 111
Lawrence kneels in prayer. He looks up as Bellini kneels
beside him. A beat.
BELLINI
(Wryly)
We seem to be running out of
favourites.
LAWRENCE
You should take over the
supervision of this election, Aldo.
BELLINI
Ha! No, thank you. You are steering
this Conclave. Exactly where I do
not know, but you are certainly
steering it. And that firm hand of
yours has i ts admirers. (Beat) I’ve
come to ask your forgiveness.
Surprised, Lawrence looks at him.
BELLINI (CONT’D)
I had the temerity to tell you to
examine your heart, when all the
time my own was...
He shakes his head.
BELLINI (CONT’D)
Shameful to be this age and still
not know yourself.
(A rueful smile)
Ambition, “the moth of holiness.”
(Beat)
Perhaps it’s time you decided upon
a name?
Lawrence stares at him.
BELLINI (CONT’D)
As the next most senior member of
the Conclave, it will fall to me to
ask you how you wish to be known as
Pope. Rightly or wrongly, it would
seem Tremblay is finished. This
will be a contest between Tedesco
and you. You’re the only one who
can stop him now.
CONCLAVE by Peter Straughan - Pink Revisions. (27.01.2023) 100.
The two old friends stare at each other. Then, as if
admitting to himself for the first time that the thought, the
ambition, was always there...
LAWRENCE
John. I would choose John.
Beat. Then Bellini nods.
BELLINI
It has a weight to it.
OMITTED112 112
INT. SISTINE CHAPEL - DAY113 113
A BLANK BALLOT.
Lawrence stares at his own sheet, for the first time at a
loss as to which name to write. He closes his eyes, hoping
f or inspiration, some sign. Nothing comes. He opens his eyes,
looks up...
And finds Tedesco watching him. The Patriarch raises his
eyebrows in amused complicity: Just you and me.
Lawrence picks up his pen, feeling he no longer has a choice.
Slowly he writes a name on the ballot. “Lawrence.”
He stands and holding the ballot above his head, walks down
the aisle to the waiting chalice, knowing he is a bout to sin.
LAWRENCE
(in Latin)
< I call as my witness Christ
the Lord, who will be my
judge, that my vote is given
before God to the one who I
think should be elected. >
LAWRENCE
Testor Christum Dominum, qui
me iudicaturus est, me eum
eligere, quem secundum Deum
iudico eligi debere.
He holds the ballot over the chalice. Hesitates.
Then he drops the ballot into the chalice.
The explosion is felt first as a ripple in the floor, a bass
vibration throughout his body. Then the boarded windows are
blasted in, raining glass down onto the chapel.
For a moment Lawrence stands, stunned, wondering, almost
hoping, that he is dead. Time slows.
CONCLAVE by Peter Straughan - Pink Revisions. (27.01.2023) 101.
For the first time bright morning light floods the former
gloom of the chapel and Lawrence finds himself dwarfed and
pitiful before Michelangelo’s vast fresco The Last Judgement.
The work burns brilliantly before him, Christ dividing the
Damned from the Saved...
He turns again and finds the doors at the end of the
vestibule beginning to open, screeching across the glass-
strewn floor.
INT. SISTINE CHAPEL - VESTIBULE - DAY113A 113A
Two SECURITY GUARDS, guns drawn, begin to push their way in.
Frightened faces peer from behind them.
INT. PAULINE CHAPEL - DAY114 114
CLOSE ON A FRESCO - Michelangelo’s Crucifixion of St Peter.
Lawrence stands, staring at the huge fresco. St Pe ter, about
to be crucified upside down, cranes his neck upward, eyes us
reproachfully.
O’Malley pads down the chapel and joins him.
MONSIGNOR O'MALLEY
Everyone has been taken to the Casa
Santa Marta, Your Eminence. No one
was seriously hurt. Some cuts,
that’s all.
Lawrence stares at the fresco for a moment.
LAWRENCE
(Without looking at him)
And outside? In the city? How bad
is it?
O’Malley passes him a s heet of paper. Lawrence reads it.
LAWRENCE (CONT’D)
(Softly)
Dear God.
O’Malley examines his exhausted face.
MONSIGNOR O'MALLEY
How are you feeling?
CONCLAVE by Peter Straughan - Pink Revisions. (27.01.2023) 102.
LAWRENCE
(Beat)
I was looking at the darkness at
the top of the painting.
(MORE)
CONCLAVE by Peter Straughan - Pink Revisions. (27.01.2023) 102A.
I used to think they were clouds.
But I think it’s smoke. There’s a
fire somewhere. Some violence. And
St Peter, straining to keep his
head upright.
O’Malley hesitates, wondering if Lawrence is in shock.
MONSIGNOR O'MALLEY
Your Eminence? The Conclave? Do we
continue?
Lawrence doesn’t know what to say.
I/E. POLICE CAR - DAY115 115
Lawrence stares out from the back of the car as it speeds
through the court yards of the Vatican, siren blaring, the
startled faces of the Swiss Guards they pass, bathed in
pulsing blue light.
He glances up at the sky, watching the helicopter that buzzes
angrily overhead, missiles protruding from its belly.
EXT. CASA SANTA MARTA - LOBBY - DAY116 116
PUSHING LAWRENCE as he strides into the Casa, sweeps through
the courtyard, past frightened groups of NUNS and CURIA.
Mandorff wait s for him.
LAWRENCE
(As he passes him)
Complete privacy, Willi.
Mandorff nods grimly and follows him towards the Casa...
INT. CASA SANTA MARTA - AULA - DAY117 117
The assembled cardinals look up anxiously from their seats.
LAWRENCE
My brothers, I would like to have
the authority of the Conclave to
discuss what has happened.
Archbishop Krasinski, a Tedesco supporter, stands.
LAWRENCE (CONT’D)
CONCLAVE by Peter Straughan - Pink Revisions. (27.01.2023) 103.
KRASINSKI
Paragraph four of the constitution
states that nothing can be done in
the College of Cardinals that “in
any way affects the procedures
governing the election of the
Supreme Pontiff.” The very fact
that you are holding this meeting
outside the Sistine Chapel is an
interference!
Beside Lawrence, Bellini is already on his feet.
BELLINI
It’s quite clear that something
serious has occurred and I for one
would like to know what it is.
TEDESCO
(Italian)
You are merely looking for an
excuse to delay the decision!
(English)
We are here to listen to God, not
news bulletins.
BELLINI
No doubt you think we shouldn’t
listen to explosions either, but we
all heard one!
There is a murmur of approval and Tedesco colours. Lawrence
seizes the moment.
LAWRENCE
Will all those who wish the
Conclave to receive thi s
information, please raise their
hands?
Scores of hands are raised - a clear majority.
LAWRENCE (CONT’D)
Very well.
LAWRENCE (CONT’D)
(Reading from the sheet of
paper)
At eleven twenty this morning, a
car bomb exploded in the Piazza del
Risorgimento.

CONCLAVE by Peter Straughan - Pink Revisions. (27.01.2023) 104.
Shortly afterwards, as people were
fleeing the scene, an individual
with explosives strapped to his
body detonated himself. There are
reports of further attacks in
Louvain and Munich...
A ripple of dismay is spreading throughout the room.
LAWRENCE (CONT’D)
The current death toll stands at
fifty two. Hundreds have been
injured.
The expressions of horror grow in volume. Tedesco lumbers to
his feet again hand r aised like an Old Testament prophet,
something horribly triumphant in his manner.
TEDESCO
(Italian)
< Here! Here we see the
result of the doctrine of
relativism so beloved of our

Lawrence leads the cardinals from the hostel. Overhead
helicopters drone. Lawrence ignores them and opens up his
umbrella. It has begun to rain.
The mass of cardinals follow, walking in silence, a sea of
white umbrellas crossing the gardens.
A sense of silent solidarity. Bellini arrives beside
Lawrence. He takes his arm in his. The two friends look at
each other, united again. They walk on.
INT. SISTINE CHAPEL - DAY120 120
The broken glass has been swept away. A faint breeze blows
through the space where the windows were.
Lawrence stands at the microphone. The beginning of what he
senses will be the final ballot of the Conclave.

From the assembled Conclave comes the low rumble o f “Amen.”
ON LAWRENCE...
...sitting staring up at the painted ceiling high above. His
gaze slips to the rows of cardinals, lingers a moment on
Tedesco, Tremblay, Adeyemi, Benitez, Bellini... He feels a
sudden wave of love for them all, in all their imperfection:
the crooked timber of humanity...
From outside comes a strange, soft sound - the rise and fall
of an immense wave. The cardinals raise thei r heads,
listening, puzzled, until they realise: it is the sound of
tens of thousands gathering in St Peter’s Square.
Droplets of water are trickling through the shattered
windows, and down the stone walls.
CONCLAVE by Peter Straughan - Pink Revisions. (27.01.2023) 108.
Lawrence watches the raindrops for a moment. Then he picks up
his pen. His mind feels suddenly calm, clear. A moment of
grace.
He begins to write.
INT. SISTINE CHAPEL - MONTAGE - DAY121 121
...ballots fall into the waiting urn....
...the ballots are pierced by the needle, threaded on the
scarlet strand.
...the hands of the Scrutineers take ballots from the urn and
pass it along...
...the white cloth is smoo thed over the table, the final urn
of counted votes is placed at its centre, ready for the
announcement...
Still in SLO-MO, the cardinals rise, one by one to their
feet, applauding...
A crowd of cardinals are gathered around someone, their backs
to us. We PUSH slowly through the crowd, which parts for us,
until we reach the cardinal at the centre, the only seated
man in the chapel...
Benitez.
Lawren ce, having reached him, stares down at the slight
figure.
LAWRENCE

< In the name of the whole
College of Cardinals, I ask
you, Cardinal Benitez, do you

LAWRENCE
Acceptasne electionem de te

Benitez, as if he hasn’t heard, continues to stare down at
his feet, his face obscured by a tumbling lock of black hair .
A long silence, a collective holding of fearful of breath. If
he should refuse...
LAWRENCE (CONT’D)

< Do you accept? >
LAWRENCE (CONT’D)
Acceptasne electionem de te

A murmur of relief, of pleasure, erupts around them. Lawrence
smiles, pats his heart to indicate his own relief.

wish to be called? >
LAWRENCE
Quo nomine vis vocari?
Benitez stands.
BENITEZ

< Innocent. >
BENITEZ
Innocentius.
A moment of silence. No Pope has derived a title from one of
the virtues for generations. The n applause of approval builds
again. Holding the table for support, Lawrence sinks to his
knees before the new Holy Father. Benitez stares down at him,
smiling, thinking...
INT. SISTINE CHAPEL - DAY / LATER122 122
Lawrence stands with Mandorff preparing the deed of
acceptance. Mandorff is filling in Benitez’s name on the deed
ready for the Pontiff’s and witnesses’ signatures. Lawrence
glances at O’Malley and finds him standing at a table,
staring with strange fixity.
LAWRENCE
(amused)
Monsignor, I’m sorry to interrupt
you...
O’Malley doesn’t react.
LAWRENCE (CONT’D)
Ray...?
Startled, O’Malley looks at him.
LAWRENCE (CONT’D)
I think you should start gathering
the cardinal’s notes. The sooner we
light the stoves, the sooner the
world will know we have a new Pope.
O’Malley blinks at him, looking confused, almost frightened.

MONSIGNOR O'MALLEY
It wasn’t... It wasn’t the outcome

No. But it’s wonderful all the

He examines O’Malley, puzzled.
LAWRENCE (CONT’D)
(Quietly)
If it’s my position you’re worried
about, let me reassure you I feel
nothing but relief. Our new Holy
Father will make a much greater
Pope than I ever would have done.
O’Malley nods, a stricken smile. He begins to walk away.
Suddenly he wheels around and returns.
MONSIGNOR O’MALLEY

Lawrence feels a stab of alarm.

Lawrence strides through the chapel towards the “Room of

INT. SISTINE CHAPEL - ANTECHAMBER - DAY124A 124A
He descends the stairs and crosses the sacristy, knocking on
the door. Father Haas opens it a little and looks at Lawrence
in alarm.
HAAS
His Holiness won’t get robed, Your
Eminence .
LAWRENCE
If you please, Father Haas...
Haas steps hurriedly aside. Lawrence enters the little room.
INT. SISTINE CHAPEL - ROOM OF TEARS - CONTINUOUS125 125
A pale Benitez sits on a narrow bench in the corner, hunched
over, looking small. The PAPAL TAILOR helplessly holds the
white cassock of the Pope, not knowing what to do.
LAWRENCE
May I speak to you alone?
BENITEZ
Of course.
The TAILOR puts the cassock away and withdraws.
LAWRENCE
You too, Father.
Surprised, Haas bows and leaves, closing the door behind him.
Lawrence and Benitez remain for a moment in silence.

It seems that even the smallest

LAWRENCE
You must tell me about this

He’s expecting anger, denial, but Benitez merely smiles,
gently.
BENITEZ
Must I, Dean?
LAWRENCE
Yes, you must! Within the hour you
will be the most famous man in the
world! So tell me - what is your

My “situatio n,” as you call it, is

There was no treatment. I
considered it, prayed for guidance.
And decided against it.
LAWRENCE
And what would it have been, this
treatment?
BENITEZ
It was called a laparoscopic
hysterectomy.
A beat. A stunned Lawrence sinks into the nearest chair.
A fter a moment, Benitez pulls up a chair across from him,
their knees almost touching.
BENITEZ (CONT’D)
(Gently)
You have to understand, when I was
a child, there was no way of
knowing my “situation” was more...

complicated. I was born to poor
parents, in a community where boys
were more prized than girls. And
the life in the seminary is, as you
know, a very modest one. But the
truth is, there simply was no
reason to think I was different
from the other young men. Then, in
my late thirties, I had an
operation to remove my appendix.
And that was when the doctors
discovered that I had a uterus and
ovaries. My chromosomes would
commonly define me as being a
woman. And yet I am also... as you
see me.
Lawrence stares at him and tries to absorb this. Benitez
smiles sympathetically.
BENITEZ (CONT’D)
It was a very dark time for me. I
felt as if my entire life as a
priest had been lived in a state of
sin. Of course, I offered my
resignation to the Holy Father. I
flew to Rome and told him
everything.
LAWRENCE
He knew?
BE NITEZ
Yes. He knew.
LAWRENCE
And he thought it was acceptable
for you to continue as an ordained
minister?
BENITEZ
I would assume so. After all, he
made me a cardinal in pectore in
full knowledge of who I am.
Lawrence is baffled, trying to absorb what he has just
learned. Benitez gently continues.
BENITEZ (CONT’D)
We considered surgery to have what
you might regard as the “female”
parts of my body removed. But th e
night before I was due to fly I
realised I was mistaken.

I was who I had always been. It
seemed to me more of a sin to
correct His handiwork than to leave
my body as it was.
LAWRENCE
Then you... you are still...?
BENITEZ
I am what God made me. And perhaps
it is my difference that will make
me useful. I think again of your
sermon. I know what it is to exist
between the world’s certainties.
Lawrence considers that.
LAWRENCE
Who knows about this, apart from
O’Ma lley?
BENITEZ
Only yourself.
Lawrence nods, thinking that O’Malley can be trusted, that
this can be kept secret.
BENITEZ (CONT’D)
And one other of course.
Lawrence looks at him.
BENITEZ (CONT’D)
God.
The two stare at each other.
INT. PAULINE CHAPEL - LATE AFTERNOON126 126
Silence. Lawrence sits, staring blankly ahead, trying to
absorb what he has just learned. Does it fundamentally change
who Benitez is?
He finds himself small i n a place so vast, staring at the
floor, trying to pray, hoping for guidance, some sense of
connection. His mind remains numb.
Suddenly he turns and stops, seeing...
A small TURTLE that is working its way across the marble.
Lawrence stares at the surreal sight - this little creature
inching towards him.
BENITEZ (CONT’D)

He walks to the turtle and picks it gently up. There’s
something so absurd about this.
INT. SISTINE CHAPEL - VESTIBULE - LATE AFTERNOON127 127
O’Malley places ballot papers and notes, any record of the
Conclave into the stove and lights them.
Then he activates the chemical canister.
His eyes are drawn slowly up the length of the flue to the
point where it projects through the open window and out into
th e sky.
EXT. VATICAN GROUNDS - LATE AFTERNOON128 128
Lawrence walks back to the fountain and places the turtle
gently back into the water.
And then he hears it.
The distant roar of a quarter of a million voices raised in
hope and acclamation as they react to the white smoke now
rising from the Vatican.
Lawrence listens as the great wave of joy rolls on, and on.
INT. CASA SANTA MARTA - LAWRENCE’S BEDROOM - EVENING129 129
Lawrence packs his clothes and few belongings into his case.
Finally he sits, at the same time feeling an overwhelming
exhaustion as well as the sensation of having accomplished
his task.
He looks up, hearing an electronic whine. The metal shutters
at his window are slowly ascending.
He opens the window and looks outside, letting in the air and
the sun, as the cool winter breeze plays with the curtains.
He smiles, content.
INT. CASA SANTA MARTA - LOBBY - EVENING129A 129A
The shutters in the lobby rise, letting in the evening light.
INT. CASA SANTA MARTA - BACK OFFICE - EVENING129B 129B
In the office the canary sits in his cage, reacting to the
sound from outside. He begins to quietly chirp.

EXT. STREETS IN ROME - EVENING130 130
Deserted streets in this ancient city. A newspaper in the
gutter. An abandoned car on the corner. Next to it an old
statue in crumbling marble under the steady stream of a
fountain.
I/E. SHOP - STREET NEAR VATICAN - EVENING130A 130A
The store with the PLASTIC PIETÀS from the beginning. And
suddenly there is Cardinal Lawrence, suitcase in hand,
resting his gaze on the small statues.
Then he heads down the street and disappears around the
corner. We HOLD on the display, the Pietàs, the compassion of
the WOMAN cradling the Man of Sorrows.
INT. SALE E TABACCHI - EVENING131 131
A near-empty bar in a small café. On the counter a cold
espresso that someone didn’t have time to finish.
Behind it, in the background, the faint flicker of a TV. The
screen shows the balcony of St. Pet er. The red shape of a
Cardinal steps through the curtains.
CARDINAL BROTZKUS
Annuntio vobis gaudium magnum.
Habemus Papam!
A small figure in a white cassock steps out next to him,
bowing his head in humble submission. And now we hear it, the
roar rising to a deafening volume, the sounds of distant
celebrations coming through on the TV.
