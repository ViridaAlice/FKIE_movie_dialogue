EDWARD
(moaning)
Ohhh....
SEAN, a co-worker, approaches cautiously.
SEAN
Hey - hey man, you all right? Do
you need to lie down or something?
EDWARD
No. This happens from time to
time...it’ll pass...thanks for
asking, though. Ohhh....
SEAN
All right. Well, just...let me
know. I’ll be at my desk.
DIRECTOR
Um. Mr. Lemuel. That was maybe on
the slightly intense side. (MORE)
      I think we want less of an aneurysm
type attack, and more like...
woozy...
DIRECTOR (CONT’D)
(moaning)
Ohhh...
EDWARD
Ohhh....
DIRECTOR
Right. We don’t want to scare
people. How’s that feel?
SEAN
Hey - hey man, you all right?
SEAN
You been at this long?
EDWARD
Little while, I guess.
SEAN
Just got out of Juilliard. This is
my first paying gig. First gig,
really. Interesting experience.
RAGGED MAN
I know what you’re all thinking,
but you’re wrong, I only want
directions, I got a brother-in-law
in Fort Lee, I ain’t from around
here, who’s gonna be the hero?
He whistles a brief and strange melody.
RAGGED MAN (CONT’D)
Where’s the conductor? Ask him,
where’s this train bound? Glory?
That’s not my ultimate destination.
Fort Lee New Jersey is my ultimate
destination. I don’t know about all
you suckers. Got a brother-in-law.
Who’s my hero?
RAGGED MAN (CONT’D)
You?
RAGGED MAN (CONT’D)
This train is hauling every sort of
soul: the good, the bad, and
especially the ugly motherfuckers.
So who’s gonna be the hero?
CASTING DIRECTOR
I’m a Casting Director specializing
in unique and unusual
physiognomies, have you ever
considered -
RAGGED MAN
Yeah, they tell me I got star
quality.
MAN
Go talk to him. He’s looking for
folks like you. He could make you a
star.
MAN (CONT’D)
(muttering)
Missin’ his lucky break. Could’ve
been a star.
LANDLORD (O.S.)
Hey, 2F! Come here a sec.
LANDLORD (CONT’D)
Feel this. This seem like a lump to
you?
EDWARD
(hesitant)
Feels a little lumpy.
LANDLORD
(to Ollie)
A little lumpy. See, Ollie? He
knows. Salamunovich says, nah,
don’t worry about it, it’s just a
gland. (MORE)
      (to Edward)
You know Salamunovich?
EDWARD
I don’t think so.
OLLIE
(indicates Edward)
You know who this guy reminds me
of? Woody Allen. When he was
younger, you know. Kinda nervous.
LANDLORD
He’s a little nervous. He’s had a
rough life.
OLLIE
(to Edward)
Be confident, brother. Take some
Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu or that Krav
Maga from Israel shit. Look, you’ll
do all right, guy.
LANDLORD
Hey, 2F - you keeping a dog in your
apartment?
EDWARD
No, why?
LANDLORD
Must be somebody else.
OLLIE
Hey, guy, all unhappiness in life
comes from not accepting what is.
You know who told me that?
LANDLORD
(grinning)
Your shrink?
OLLIE
I’m serious, you know who told me
that? All unhappiness in life comes
not from, er -
LANDLORD (CONT’D)
      LANDLORD
Not accepting what is.
OLLIE
Lady Gaga. I knew that fucking
bitch when she was a dumb fat kid.
Nice girl. Smart girl. Pretty girl,
but kinda, y’know, big.
INGRID
Your hand! I just unpacked my first
aid kit. Right back, hold on...
INGRID (CONT’D)
(referring to the door:)
I’ll take care of it, don’t worry.
Here, stand here. No, there. The
light’s better there.
INGRID (CONT’D)
I’m not a doctor, I waive all
liability, do you consent? Anti￾bacterial ointment and gauze pads,
that’s the extent of my -
“expertise” is overstating it.
INGRID (CONT’D)
Expired. Recently. It’s probably
still good, right?
INGRID (CONT’D)
Paper towels - bad for the earth.
Now, let’s examine the wound...
(surprised)
Huh, maybe it needs stitches. What
do you think?
EDWARD
Yeah - I mean, no -
INGRID
What happened to you? It’s none of
my business.
INGRID (CONT’D)
Those assholes - and then I just
stood there like a moron. And I
thought, I’ve already made an enemy
in my new building.
(pause)
This will sting.
      INGRID (CONT’D)
Did it not sting?
EDWARD
A little.
INGRID
Good. I think that’s good. Brave
man.
(indicating the ointment)
Potent.
INGRID (CONT’D)
Oh no, I got it on the couch. Paper
towel. Let me know if it doesn’t
come out.
(beat)
You should get that checked out.
INGRID (CONT’D)
Your apartment is so lived-in.
EDWARD
Yeah, well, it, I mean, it makes
sense, I -
INGRID
Mine’s a war zone. Can I look
around?
EDWARD
Be my - go ahead.
INGRID
Are you from here?
EDWARD
Yeah.
INGRID
I’m from Ålesund. Heard of it?
Sorry, what was your name again?
EDWARD
Edward.
INGRID
E. Lemuel.
      INGRID (CONT’D)
I’m Ingrid. Did I say that?
INGRID (CONT’D)
Is this your mom?
EDWARD
Yeah.
INGRID
(refers to the boy)
Is that you?
EDWARD
Yeah.
Ingrid considers this.
INGRID
(quietly)
Little Edward.
(beat)
She alive?
EDWARD
Nope.
INGRID
So, what do you do?
EDWARD
I was just...cutting some onions
and...
INGRID
You’re a writer?
EDWARD
Oh - found it on the street.
      INGRID
Looks valuable.
INGRID (CONT’D)
(reads)
They taunt me and beg me to show my
face, only so that, when I do, they
can turn away in horror.
(to Edward)
What’s that?
EDWARD
I guess I was testing it out.
INGRID
It’s interesting. Actually, I’m a
playwright. That’s not a hint. I
write longhand.
EDWARD
I act.
INGRID
Amazing. I’m trying to think if
I’ve seen you in anything.
EDWARD
Not likely.
INGRID
Yeah, well - maybe we’ll ride to
glory together.
EDWARD
Maybe.
INGRID
Who lived in my apartment before
me? C. Pulaski?
EDWARD
Once he came over to borrow some
laundry detergent. Old guy. Widower
maybe.
INGRID
Did he die?
EDWARD
I didn’t know he was gone.
      INGRID
Actually - this isn’t why I came
over - can I borrow some laundry
detergent?
EDWARD
Uh, sure...let me...
INGRID
I think your sauce is burning.
EDWARD (O.S.)
What?
INGRID
I’m on it.
INGRID (CONT’D)
Learning to whistle?
INGRID (CONT’D)
Beyond hope.
INGRID (CONT’D)
(quietly)
God...
DR. VARNO
Alright, on your back.
DR. VARNO
All in all, things look relatively
stable. Eventually, we’ll have to
do something about the growth over
your left eye. Your vision is
noticeably impacted?
EDWARD
I’ve adjusted.
DR. VARNO
You don’t drive, right?
EDWARD
No.
DR. VARNO
Who dressed that, you?
EDWARD
There’s a girl...next door...
DR. VARNO
Girl’s no doctor, I take it.
DR. VARNO (CONT’D)
This makes it two or so years
without surgery. A much-needed
respite.
EDWARD
Yeah.
DR. VARNO
Let’s aim for three years. But I
must be frank that sooner or later,
the eye will become debilitating.
As for the cholesteatoma - I think
we should go in and get that thing
out, but the hearing loss is
minimal, so we can probably sit on
it for a bit. Several other tumors
have shown mild enlargement but no
impingement on any important
structures, so...just some things
we have to keep an eye on. (MORE)
      (beat:)
I mention this so that you have an
idea of the road ahead - not that
it’s news to you. But an
alternative path has presented
itself.
DR. VARNO (CONT’D)
I don’t know how to bring this up
naturally, so I’ll just blurt it
out. A colleague of mine, Eugene
Flexner, rather distinguished, is
on the lookout for patients - a
patient - person - like you for an
experimental drug trial. This drug
seems to have the potential to be -
we don’t like to use the words
“miracle drug” but - I shouldn’t
overpromise anything, because I
don’t know the details, but -
reverse the - words like “heal” and
“cure” are anathema to folks in my
profession but - to actually heal
you. Completely, even. So I took
the liberty of telling him about
you and he’s rather desperate to
meet you. The implications
are...life-changing -- for you.
EDWARD
Heal me?
DR. VARNO
As far as it goes.
EDWARD
How?
DR. VARNO
That’s a question for Dr. Flexner.
(beat)
There’s likely financial
compensation as well, though he and
I didn’t discuss that aspect.
EDWARD
Would it - is it...safe?
DR. VARNO (CONT’D)
It’s the first trial, I believe.
Perhaps any potential risk is worth
the potential reward? Something to
think about.
INGRID
What’s up, neighbor?
EDWARD
Housewarming. For the door.
INGRID
Didn’t your mother give this to
you?
EDWARD
I found it on the street.
INGRID
Right.
EDWARD
I just wanna get rid of it, and
you’re a play writer.
INGRID
You could probably get some cash
for it.
EDWARD
Write me a part.
      INGRID
(laughs)
I’ll get on that. Thanks. Very
generous. It’s heavy!
INGRID (CONT’D)
(seeing her friend)
Oh my god, hey!
(to Edward)
Thanks again.
EDWARD
The answer should be clear to you!
Whom else would I love but the most
beautiful woman in the world? Of
course! The most beautiful of all
women! The most captivating, the
most intelligent...it's perfectly
transparent. I have no illusions.
Sometimes in the blue shadows of
evening, I give way to tender
feelings. I go into a garden,
smelling the fragrance of spring
with my poor monstrous nose, and
watch a man and a woman strolling
together in the moonlight. I think
how much I, too, would like to be
walking arm in arm with a woman,
under the moon. I let myself be
carried away, I forget myself - and
then I suddenly see the shadow of
my profile on the garden wall.
NARRATOR (ON TV)
Sad as it is, it will come as no
surprise. Attractive people are the
winners in most areas of life and
the workplace is no exception.
There are many different types of
what we now refer to as facial
differences. Here are some
examples, ranging from mild to
extreme.
NARRATOR (CONT’D)
You’re likely to be startled or
perturbed when you see a face like
this. You might stare tactlessly
or, on the contrary, avert your
gaze, even if you’re generally a
kind person. You’re not alone in
having these reactions. Studies
suggest these responses stem from
an ancient disease-avoidance system
that normally prevents us from
catching illnesses. Put simply, we
treat disfigurements like
infectious diseases. Our intrinsic
fear of others who don’t resemble
us compounds the problem. These
uneasy feelings may diminish or
subside after repeated exposure to
your facially different co-worker.
Be gentle with yourself for having
these reactions. We have no control
over the fight-or-flight responses
of the reptilian part of our
brains. But as developed, empathic
beings, there are strategies we can
adopt do be more inclusive. Here,
according to experts, are some
techniques.
Make your disfigured co-worker feel
included on your team’s project,
and make an effort to seek their
input.
SEAN (ON TV)
Luther, do you have any feedback
for Sally?
DISFIGURED MAN (ON TV)
It seems like an ace idea to me.
NARRATOR (ON TV)
When appropriate, invite them to
social functions.
JON (ON TV)
So, Morris, it’s my birthday this
weekend.
SILVERHEELS (ON TV)
Oh, really? How old are you?
JON (ON TV)
It’s a big one, let’s leave it at
that. But I’m having this little
get-together at my place, and I was
thinking you should come. Sally
will be there.
SILVERHEELS (ON TV)
Aces. Thank you for thinking of me.
It means a lot.
JON (ON TV)
Of course. So you’re coming?
SILVERHEELS (ON TV)
I think I can probably - I have to -
      JON (ON TV)
And you’re welcome to bring
someone, if there’s girl or...
SILVERHEELS (ON TV)
Thank you. Happy birthday!
NARRATOR (ON TV)
Ask how they’re doing occasionally,
as you would ask anyone else. If
they appear to be in distress,
gently inquire if they need your
help, without assuming their
dependance on you.
EDWARD (ON TV)
(moaning)
Ohhh...
SEAN (ON TV)
Hey- hey man, you all right? Do you
need to lie down or something?
EDWARD (ON TV)
No. This happens from time to
time...it’ll pass...thanks for
asking, though. Ohhh...
SEAN (ON TV)
All right, well, just...let me
know...I’ll be at my desk. Hey,
have you seen Sally anywhere?
EDWARD
That’s basically it.
INGRID
Is there more of you?
EDWARD
No.
      Ingrid claps. The video continues to play.
INGRID
So, what is it, it’s like they show
it in offices?
EDWARD
I think something like that.
INGRID
Well, it seems like an important
tool.
INGRID (CONT’D)
I mean, hey, you made an
impression. We all gotta start
somewhere.
INGRID (CONT’D)
You have this teeny blackhead and
I’m dying to get at it.
INGRID (CONT’D)
Your skin is very oily. I have a
good cream for that. Got a tissue?
Ah, I see.
INGRID (CONT’D)
I...no, I...I’m sorry, I have to
go.
EDWARD
No, I’m sorry.
INGRID
Don’t be...sorry...I just realized
I have something...I’ll...
NARRATOR (ON TV) (O.S.)
Psychologists have begun to uncover
where disgust comes from, with some
researchers believing the emotion
is similar to fear. “Fear evolved
to keep you away from large animals
that want to eat you from the
outside,” says Valerie Curtis, a
behavioral scientist at the London
School of Hygiene and Tropical
Medicine.
DOCTOR FLEXNER (O.S.)
Okay, and then...
DOCTOR FLEXNER (O.S.) (CONT’D)
This is just a file photo, but I
believe we all get the idea. All
right, let’s move on - Dr. Trutz.
      DOCTOR FLEXNER (CONT’D)
As you may know, the drug was
originally developed as a treatment
for androgenic alopecia, an area in
which it’s shown significant
promise, it’s in Phase Three
trials...but what we’re attempting
here -- though of course, for a far
more niche market - is a different
beast altogether. At the dose we
propose to administer, physical
modifications of the hard and soft
tissues, both reductive and
augmentative, were observed without
manual shaving or grafting. There
is the potential to restore form
and function to bodies containing a
variety of defects, which is
paramount to a patient’s physical
appearance, while reducing overall
costs and with only a moderate
level of morbidity. A non-zero
number of reports of wound
dehiscence and vessel damage were
recorded, not clinically
significant...
DOCTOR JEWELL
We’ll use this to measure the
progress and we’ll feed any
inconsistencies back into the
machine.
DOCTOR FLEXNER
What a world!
DOCTOR JEWELL
Log book. Next to each potential
side-effect, mark the number, zero
meaning non-existent, one meaning
mild, ten meaning - then use the
blank space to add more specific
details.
EDWARD
If these aren’t placebos.
DOCTOR JEWELL
Even if it is placebo, write it
down. Even if you have no side
effects, note that. Mark zero.
DOCTOR JEWELL (CONT’D)
These are going to help protect
your kidneys. Take them every four
hours, on the dot.
      EDWARD
These could be placebos.
DOCTOR JEWELL
These ones, no, not placebo.
Everybody gets these to protect the
kidneys. The placebo arms are for
the Turpidol and the Ochiprosoponib
medications, so theoretically, yes,
with those, you won't know for
sure, but I’d just put that idea
out of your head.
DOCTOR JEWELL (CONT’D)
Now let’s get that bandage changed.
DOCTOR JEWELL (CONT’D)
Dr. Trutz.
DOCTOR JEWELL (CONT’D)
Can we fix that up?
(to Edward:)
This one’s a pro. See you tomorrow,
Mr. Lemuel.
LANDLORD
2F, I left Nestor a message, like I
told you, he’s currently
indisposed, like I told you,
because of a death in the family,
as you know. Anything to add to
that?
LANDLORD (CONT’D)
Or you’re just stopping by to ask
me how my abscess is coming along?
EDWARD
Abscess?
LANDLORD
Just take good care of your teeth.
EDWARD
Well...just - it’s - now it’s -
getting bigger - leaking
LANDLORD
You know I can’t fix nothin’ myself
no more, on account of the lame-ass
leg.
EDWARD
Where’s the old - Rodrigo or...?
LANDLORD
Rodriguez moved to Key West,
married some guy he met on his
iPhone. Nestor’s his relation of
some sort.
      A good man, and then his mother
died, very sudden as I understand
it.
EDWARD
Okay, well...okay.
LANDLORD
Let him grieve a few days, then
he’ll take a look when he’s up to
it emotionally. Did you feel my
lump?
EDWARD
Yeah.
LANDLORD
Right, that’s right.
(beat)
A man never gets over the death of
his mother. As you surely know.
LANDLORD (CONT’D)
Nobody else has a hole. What did
you do?
EDWARD
(assertive)
I didn’t do anything.
LANDLORD
(backing down)
Yeah, okay. Why d’you suppose these
things happen to you, 2F?
INGRID
What did I miss?
INGRID
His last name was Ostermeier, according to the mailbox.
EDWARD
Yeah, Ostermeier.
INGRID
You knew him?
EDWARD
No.
      INGRID
Would you kill yourself?
EDWARD
I don’t know. Maybe. Depends on the
circumstances.
INGRID
Don’t say maybe. Say no.
EDWARD
Would you?
INGRID
There’s a question. I know I asked
first.
INGRID (CONT’D)
Hey, where’s my bandage?
EDWARD
Yeah, it healed.
INGRID
It’s like a miracle. I’m like St.
Francis. I guess I chose the wrong
profession.
INGRID (CONT’D)
Now I want to slash you again so I
can get some more practice.
INGRID (CONT’D)
Nervous Nelly. Sorry.
EDWARD
What are your plays about?
INGRID
No! Don’t ask! I’d rather talk
about suicide.
EDWARD
Sorry.
      INGRID
I just feel embarrassed talking
about - especially when it’s still
in progress. I call myself a
writer, but it’s - it’s sort of
aspirational. I mean, I do write.
I’ve done a few translations of
this Italian - I - he’s nobody, you
wouldn’t know him. I won an award
for it. Small, but...but I’m trying
to write my first original play.
I’m still figuring it out. Gee, you
probably want your typewriter back.
EDWARD
Throw it out for all I give a shit.
INGRID
I wouldn’t throw it out. At the
very least, it makes me look like a
writer. Its presence mocks me.
EDWARD
Inspires you.
INGRID
Hey! That’s the most positive thing
I’ve heard you say. What’s your
favorite play?
EDWARD
I don’t know. There’s one about the
seller - selling - salesman.
INGRID
Uh-huh.
EDWARD
I saw a pretty good one on TV about
Nazis.
INGRID
Which one’s that?
EDWARD
I don’t know the name. There was
dancing, singing, and Nazis.
INGRID
The Nazis were dancing and singing?
EDWARD
No, the...the...other...
      INGRID
Jews?
EDWARD
I guess so.
INGRID
The Jews were dancing and singing?
EDWARD
Probably I’m misremembering.
INGRID
Sounds like maybe a weird dream you
had.
INGRID (CONT’D)
(alarmed)
Do you know that guy?
EDWARD
I don’t think so.
INGRID
Why is he waving to you?
EDWARD
I don’t know.
INGRID
What did he want? Why did he think
he knew you?
EDWARD
That happens to me sometimes.
INGRID
It does?
EDWARD
I’d like to come see your play when
it’s all done.
INGRID
You’re gonna be in it, right?
The diner’s COOK walks over.
      COOK
You folks enjoying everything?
EDWARD
Yeah.
COOK
Need anything else?
EDWARD
No thank you.
COOK
Pizza was good? Complaints?
INGRID
Are you the owner?
COOK
I make the pies, honey.
INGRID
Do you always check up on the
customers?
COOK
Just thought I’d stop on over and
make sure you young folks were all
set. You had the mushroom slice,
guy, right? Was it prepared to your
satisfaction?
EDWARD
Yeah, thank you.
COOK
Left a few bites. That’s not a
sign?
EDWARD
No, I...I’m still picking at it.
COOK
Pick away. Knife and fork style. So
no special feedback? I can handle
it. Crust too crispy? Too light on
the mushrooms?
      COOK (CONT’D)
There’s always room for
improvement. Well, thank you very
much for your patronage. It would
be so great if you could come back.
Come every day. We’re always open.
Christmas, Passover, you name it,
my door is open. Promise me you’ll
stop in again.
EDWARD
I promise.
COOK
Halloween, Día de los Muertos, and
you better bring the pretty lady.
You make a lovely couple. Okay, you
folks have a terrific day.
INGRID
What the hell was that?
EDWARD
I don’t know.
INGRID
What the fuck? Lot of weird things
happening tonight.
DOCTOR FLEXNER
Incredible.
EDWARD
I guess this means I’m not in the
control group?
DOCTOR FLEXNER
I can’t disclose that information
officially.
DOCTOR TRUTZ
This could be something called the
placebo effect.
EDWARD
It seems a little drastic to be the
placebo effect.
DOCTOR FLEXNER
But one never knows, does one?
EDWARD
I have to admit I - that I’m
starting to feel a
little...frightened. Is this safe?
My face was falling off in clumps.
DOCTOR FLEXNER
I’m sure they only looked like
clumps to you.
      EDWARD
Big - like gobs - my - flesh.
DOCTOR FLEXNER
Skin particles. The growths were
cleaving at fascial planes. You’re
healing, Mr. Lemuel. We’re in
uncharted territory here, full of
promise and mystery. There’s
obviously an element of danger, as
you were made fully aware of prior
to your participation. All we can
do is monitor closely and use our
experience as a guide, but I’d say
this is cause for excitement. This
is beyond our wildest expectations.
You’re a part of medical history.
You may be the subject of a
documentary one day.
EDWARD
If I’m not in the control group.
DOCTOR FLEXNER
Don’t waver, Mr. Lemuel. And if at
all possible, I’d like for you to
photograph yourself - say a dozen
times a day - just so we can
monitor the rate of change, which
appears to be rapid. Reasonable?
(beat)
Perhaps the risk is worth the
reward? Something to think about.
DR. JEWELL
Nosebleeds. Is that common for you?
      EDWARD
I don’t think so.
DR. JEWELL
We’ll run blood tests to check for
clotting abnormalities, blood cell
problems, electrolyte imbalances
and whatnot. Headaches. That’s
expected, that’s the number one
side effect. Essentially it means
you’re taking the medicine.
Diarrhea, also common, and you have
IBS, it says here. Is it worse than
usual?
EDWARD
Yes.
DR. JEWELL
Stay hydrated. Drink those yellow
sports drinks. They taste good too.
(squinting at the logbook)
Your handwriting is like a
doctor’s. Vivid dreams. Good
dreams, I hope.
EDWARD
No.
DR. JEWELL
Ah. Bad dreams. Normal for you?
EDWARD
Yes.
DR. JEWELL
My poor daughter gets them. Has to
sleep with me now. In my dreams I
fly, I make love. Why should she
suffer? Try listening to music in
bed. The lute - that helps I hear.
That particular timbre - maybe the
lap steel or the lute, but I don’t
know, look it up. What’s
this...peculiar sense of taste?
EDWARD
I think, like, like chocolate. I
had to spit it out.
DR. JEWELL
You spit chocolate out?
      EDWARD
Yeah.
DR. JEWELL
(pause)
You eat a lot of treats?
DR. JEWELL (CONT’D)
Well, cut the sweet stuff out for
now. Really, you should phase it
out entirely. You’re not a kid
anymore, Mr. Lemuel. But I’m not
your rabbi. Look, your body is
adjusting to a boatload of new and
potent - not to mention
experimental - medication, and
these are all fairly standard-issue
side effects, so just bear with us.
The risk is surely worth the
reward, I would think.
DOCTOR FLEXNER
I’ve got something for you.
EDWARD
What do I do with it?
DOCTOR FLEXNER
Keep it. As a souvenir. A reminder.
EDWARD
Of what?
Flexner stares intently at Edward.
EDWARD (CONT’D)
You don’t...need it?
      DOCTOR FLEXNER
I can just make them, one after
another. Push of a button. 3D
technology. I make all sorts of
things now. It’s a new passion of
mine. Look -
DOCTOR FLEXNER (CONT’D)
George Washington. I’m a history
nut. And check this out.
DOCTOR FLEXNER (CONT’D)
Recognize her? Dr. Trutz. You know
her. Good rendering, right?
Beautiful. I made two of me, too,
but they’re not here at the moment.
ATHLETIC MAN
Did you start that?
ATHLETIC MAN (CONT’D)
That alarm!
ATHLETIC MAN (CONT’D)
You’re an actor, right? A movie
actor. I seen you around. Or a
model? On a billboard?
ATHLETIC MAN (CONT’D)
Gotta be careful out there, man.
BARTENDER
You just put your lips together and
blow.
(to Edward)
Crapper’s for customers only.
BARTENDER
(to Edward:)
So what’s it gonna be?
BARTENDER (CONT’D)
Something potent, from the looks of
it.
BARTENDER (CONT’D)
Up? Rocks?
BARTENDER (CONT’D)
Ah, let’s not dilute its medicinal
value.
GUY
Hey, man, I know you. Where do I
know you from?
EDWARD
I don’t know.
GUY
Do you recognize me? I’m Guy Gaunt.
Ring a bell?
EDWARD
I don’t think so. Maybe. I can’t
place it.
GUY
Volunteer fireman?
EDWARD
What?
GUY
Do you work for facebook?
EDWARD
No but - I get this a lot.
GUY
That’s not it. It’s you, I saw you,
and I’d remember you. I don’t
forget a face. You got a little,
like, blood or something...
GUY (CONT’D)
What’s your name?
EDWARD
Edward.
GUY
After that though?
EDWARD
Lemuel.
      GUY
Okay. Edward Lemlul, hm. Well, as I
said, I’m Guy Gaunt. This is a real
mystery. It’ll come to me. You
think about it too.
EDWARD
Okay.
BARTENDER
(to Edward)
You looking at that cane?
BARTENDER (CONT’D)
That’s Teddy Roosevelt’s cane.
Jesus, boss, you’re bleeding. Here,
wipe yourself.
BARTENDER (CONT’D)
There’s something strange about
you. Different.
EDWARD
(uncharacteristically
assertive)
Yeah, yeah, you noticed, huh?
BARTENDER
What is it?
EDWARD
You can’t place it.
BARTENDER
Something with your face, right?
EDWARD
(sarcastic)
Uh-huh.
BARTENDER
What, it’s so obvious? I’m near-sighted, man. Can’t see shit. Look,
you got an interesting thing going
on, but you’re all nervous. You
this nervous all the time?
      EDWARD
What makes you think I’m nervous?
BARTENDER
Just your fucking energy, man.
Makes me nervous.
BARTENDER (CONT’D)
For christ’s sake. You can keep the
rag.
GUY
You okay, Edward?
EDWARD
Whiskey?
BARTENDER
Rocks?
EDWARD
I don’t want to dilute its
medicinal value.
BARTENDER
You what?
NESTOR
You got the hole?
EDWARD
Oh, yeah...okay. What time is it?
NESTOR
This is 2F?
EDWARD
The hole’s over here.
NESTOR
What did you do?
EDWARD
I didn’t do anything.
NESTOR
You shouldn’t have let it go like
this.
EDWARD
What was I supposed - I didn’t know
what - I told what’s-his-face, the
downstairs, uh...Where were you?
NESTOR
Gallstones.
EDWARD
I thought your - wasn’t - your
mother...?
NESTOR
You’re the man who lives here?
EDWARD
Well, yeah.
      NESTOR
There’s another man who lives here
though?
EDWARD
Sometimes. Maybe. Why?
NESTOR
You’re the one who complained about
this hole? The man with the dog?
EDWARD
No, I - I mean, I have a cat.
NESTOR
A cat? Named what?
EDWARD
I don’t know.
NESTOR
Is that the guy that lives here?
EDWARD
That’s...art.
NESTOR
Like a mask?
EDWARD
Yeah - a bust.
NESTOR
Pretty weird stuff.
EDWARD
Yeah.
NESTOR
That’s the cat?
EDWARD
Yeah.
NESTOR
Okay, I’ll fix the hole.
      EDWARD
Should I leave?
NESTOR
You do whatever you want.
EDWARD
Should I help? You want some tap
water?
NESTOR
I hope I have the materials for
this. This is a big problem. Should
have fixed this sooner.
DOCTOR FLEXNER
(to Edward)
I’m sorry, it was open. Is this Ed
Lemuel’s apartment?
EDWARD
Um...
DOCTOR FLEXNER
I know it’s early. I’m looking for
Mr. Lemuel. He’s a patient of mine.
We haven’t heard from him for a
week. No one in our office can get
ahold of him.
EDWARD
(quiet)
Yeah, well, what happened was,
he’s...Edward’s dead.
DOCTOR FLEXNER
What? Dead? How? When?
EDWARD
It happened - was very sudden.
I’m...Guy. A family friend.
DOCTOR FLEXNER
Family? Is there a funeral?
      EDWARD
Yeah - no, it’s all over. He’s dead
and buried. Cremated.
DOCTOR FLEXNER
What? Was he - sick?
EDWARD
He just - I don’t know. We’re
trying to find out. Suicide.
DOCTOR FLEXNER
Suicide? Was he depressed?
EDWARD
I don’t know.
DOCTOR FLEXNER
He was cremated?
EDWARD
I think, cremated, yeah.
DOCTOR FLEXNER
So...you’re serious...Mr. Lemuel is
really gone?
EDWARD (O.S.)
He’s really gone....just like that.
MARIANA
I think you have mice. Saw some
droppings. You need a cat.
MARIANA (CONT’D)
I’ll be back to get that blackhead.
See ya.
NICK
I notice that isn’t on your little
billboard.
EDWARD
What?
NICK
Just that pockmark or whatever it
is. It’s nothing. No one would
think anything of it. (MORE)
      But blown up like that, of course
they’re gonna wanna smooth it over.
What’d they pay you?
EDWARD
Nothing.
NICK
So you got screwed.
CLAY
When I modeled, the pay was insane.
NICK
You? You’re number three on my
least attractive people I’ve ever
met list.
CLAY
I was a hand model.
MARIANA
(genuinely impressed)
Jesus Christ, these are beautiful,
how did I never notice these?
CLAY
Yeah, but look.
CLAY (CONT’D)
A little pasta water accident and
that dream came tumbling down.
MARIANA
(caressing the burn)
Character.
CLAY
I’ve accepted it.
NICK
(to Edward)
You’re gonna have to change your
name if you want to be a famous
model. Guy Moratz? Sounds made up.
      MARIANA
He’s on the lam.
NICK
Who’d you kill? I won’t tell.
CLAY
You got an agent yet?
EDWARD
No.
CLAY
I can hook you up with some names.
NICK
Listen to these fuckheads.
CLAY
(to Edward)
Just be careful with the pasta
water.
MARIANA
Yeah, a little shaving accident
and, boom, you’ll be lucky if they
still let you sell houses.
NICK
Stay humble, Fabio. I see you over
there, gettin’ a big head.
SILVERHEELS
(reading)
They taunt me and beg me to show my
face, only so that, when I do, they
can turn away...in horror...
INGRID
Thank you, Mr. Silverheels.
INGRID (CONT’D)
May I help you?
EDWARD
I...
INGRID
Are you here for “Edward”?
EDWARD
Well - I...
INGRID
Is he on the call sheet?
VIVIAN
Sammy Silverheels was the last one
for the day.
INGRID
Did you get sides?
      Edward doesn’t answer.
INGRID (CONT’D)
Viv, get him sides. Let him read
for Theo.
INGRID (CONT’D)
Whenever you’re ready.
EDWARD
(reading haltingly)
If it was me, I’d just move out of
the building, forfeit my deposit. I
couldn’t live next to that. Every
time you step outside, not knowing
if he’s gonna be there. Always
being on guard - Jesus. I’d have
nightmares.
FIONA
(reading)
Come on, don’t be an asshole. You
don’t mean that.
EDWARD
(reading)
I sure as hell do mean it, and I
don’t feel bad about it either.
Humans are hard-wired to fear and
despise the sick and the ugly. Used
to leave deformed babies out to die
in the cold. Put ‘em in
institutions at least. I’ve got
science on my side. You know it’s
true, but you’re just being
politically...
      SILVERHEELS
I need this, man. I’d be right for
it, too. Kind of born for it. You
know how it is, just want to tell
my mama, hey, it was all worth it.
Maybe not literally, not
financially, not yet, but a leading
part. It’s not exactly Hamlet, but
still, your little Johnny - leading
part. Nine years I’ve been at this.
Losin’ my looks! Getting hard to
justify not going to night school.
The life we’ve chosen, huh?
EDWARD
Yeah.
VIVIAN
Okay, Mr. Moratz.
FIONA
There...all better. Does it hurt?
EDWARD
No.
      FIONA
Good. Hey...that photo..is that
you, as a boy?
EDWARD
Yeah.
INGRID
(to Edward)
Excuse me - I’m sorry, what is
going on here?
EDWARD
I...what...?
INGRID
Forgive me if I’m - what - is
that...some kind of mask?
EDWARD
It’s a prototype.
INGRID
A prototype of...what?
EDWARD
For the face...the eventual...
we’ll use makeup, I don’t know,
however you wanna do it.
INGRID
Sorry, who are you exactly?
EDWARD
I’m Edward.
VIVIAN
Guy Moratz. Supposedly.
INGRID
Are you Guy Moratz?
EDWARD
I was born for this.
INGRID
So...are you...deformed?
EDWARD
I am this guy.
      INGRID
I don’t think we can afford makeup.
This is an off-broadway production.
Do I know you? You sound familiar.
Can you take off that mask, please?
EDWARD
Let me do the scene.
INGRID
Where did you get that mask?
EDWARD
(to Fiona)
Begin, please.
FIONA
There...all better. Does it hurt?
EDWARD
No.
FIONA
Good. Hey...that photo..is that
you, as a boy?
EDWARD
Yeah.
FIONA
Very cute. So...I guess...you
weren’t born...
(pause)
I’m sorry, it’s not my place.
EDWARD
It’s okay.
FIONA
People probably ask you a lot of
questions.
EDWARD
The questions I don’t mind so much.
FIONA
No? People can be cruel, I imagine.
      FIONA (CONT’D)
You have an eyelash. Let me get it.
She touches his eye. He grabs her hand and holds it in place.
They stare at each other. Edward leans in to kiss her.
FIONA (CONT’D)
I...I have to go.
EDWARD
I’m sorry, I--
FIONA
No, no. I didn’t realize what time
it was.
EDWARD
It’s just no one’s ever touched
my...my...face...before...
INGRID
Juilliard?
EDWARD
You don’t believe it.
INGRID
No - just - your first audition was
a little...
EDWARD
I was traumatized because, I have a
sort of - personal - passion - for
this - subject - because, uh, my
friend - childhood - best - friend -
he was - had a condition, much like
the - Edward - your Edward -
INGRID
Don’t tell me his name is Edward.
EDWARD
No, no - Ronnie.
      INGRID
(mishearing)
Can Lonnie act?
EDWARD
He died. And so - and I was
overcome with - which is why I feel
strongly that I need to play this
part.
INGRID
That’s one way to honor a friend.
How’d he die?
EDWARD
Uh - disease -
INGRID
You know, Fiona went to Juilliard
too.
EDWARD
Oh!
EDWARD (CONT’D)
Did you know an...Edward?
INGRID
An Edward? It can’t just be a story
my brilliant imagination has cooked
up? I’ve known, you know, a couple
people, it’s kind of a, what’s the
word...?
EDWARD
Tribute?
INGRID
An amalgamation. It’s me too- part
of the character is based on
myself, in a way.
EDWARD
How’s that?
      INGRID
(referring to the mask)
Is that Lonnie?
(laughs)
EDWARD
I...played...long time ago -
Richard the Third.
INGRID
Jesus, that’s an extreme Richard
the Third. To be perfectly blunt, I
had wanted to cast a person
with...who looks like...
(looking at the mask)
I mean, who looks like that!
Ideally. I’ve seen a a handful of
people with different facial...
and...disabilities...but...I mean,
it’s hard. You get an fixated on an
idea. If it’s not right, it’s not
right.
EDWARD
You had someone specific in mind.
INGRID
The question is, do you cast
someone with a condition, even if
he’s not the best fit? Is it wrong
to cast someone because of their
disfigurement? Exploitative even?
Will people come to gawk? Where is
the ethical line? It’s funny...
Edward, he has an awkwardness in
his own skin, so, it’s kind of
brilliant in a way - seeing you -
who looks like- you, and you’re not
yourself, you’ve got this mask,
this other persona, and there’s
this dissonance...it clicked - for
me - it was strangely affecting. It
was like I saw my creation come to
life.
EDWARD
You might need to convince them.
INGRID
I don’t have to convince anyone.
It’s my play, pal.
INGRID
Hi, Mr. Sablosky.
INGRID
(quietly)
He’s blind. Shoes off, please.
EDWARD
Uh, are you looking at my socks?
INGRID
They’re cute.
EDWARD
Is that where you do your writing?
INGRID
Never used it. Not sure it even
works.
EDWARD
Seems to work.
INGRID
Great. It’s yours. Give it a proper
home.
EDWARD
Where’d it come from?
INGRID
Looks Italian.
EDWARD
What’s its name?
INGRID
C. Pulaski.
INGRID (CONT’D)
Goddamn her.
EDWARD
Who’s that?
INGRID
This intolerable old hag that lives
down there. Can’t even walk around
barefoot in here. Here’s the bar.
EDWARD
Oh, I’ve had enough.
INGRID
Well, make me something.
EDWARD
How long have you lived here?
EDWARD (CONT’D)
I don’t think the old hag is gonna
appreciate that.
INGRID
What’s worse? Me, having to tip-toe
around so as not to upset the
sensitive bitch, or her, having to
live with such a noisy little bitch
upstairs?
EDWARD
I’d rather live in a house by
myself.
      INGRID
That’s no answer.
INGRID (CONT’D)
Cops after you?
EDWARD
What?
INGRID
You’re jumpy.
EDWARD
I startle easily.
INGRID
Yeah. Nervous Nelly. Think it’s the
bitch?
INGRID (CONT’D)
Boo!
Edward jumps. Ingrid laughs.
INGRID (CONT’D)
Sorry, had to do it.
EDWARD
Who was that?
INGRID
Oh, jilted lover.
INGRID (CONT’D)
So many jilted lovers.
INGRID (CONT’D)
I leave a trail of tragedy in my
wake.
INGRID (CONT’D)
I warned you.
EDWARD
(reciting lines:)
A gust of wind, the jostling of the
train, the spray of the shower, the
pressure of the pillow when I rest,
any small thing might be too much
for this brittle structure to bear,
would knock some element out of
whack and-! Yet, I’ve held out. The
doctors have helped it along, of
course. They’ve reinforced the
pieces with screws, rods, metal.
These procedures have bolstered the
foundation, but the result is
hardly foolproof; it may protect my
skull from a spontaneous collapse
while I’m sitting in stillness,
though they can’t guarantee even
that. The sad reality is that my
face is fragile and it’s imperative
that I conduct my life based upon
this fact. When in doubt, live in
fear, that’s my mantra. Stay out of
barrooms or crowded places in
general; be nice to people; be
deferential; be the bigger man;
argue, if I must - and really I
mustn’t - only from a safe distance
or under the protection of a
powerful friend, if I even had one
and if he could then be relied
upon. I tell myself, Edward: Don’t
call attention to yourself -
useless advice. Still, I’ve made it
this far. Who’s to say what I...
OSWALD
Pardon me for intruding. I met
this casting director - unique and
unusual physiognomies is his
specialty - he told me you were
holding auditions for this
interesting-sounding play, he
thought I might perhaps be a proper
fit. I’m no actor, but I thought
I’d come take a gander. From the
tidbit I’ve just seen, I must say
it looks like a very curious piece!
But I see the role is filled, and
quite ably. Cheers to all involved.
Best of luck. Break a leg, as they
say. I’ll come see it when it
opens. Good day!
      INGRID
Wait, hold on.
EDWARD
What?
INGRID
You have the mask?
EDWARD
What?
INGRID
Put it on.
EDWARD
Really? Why?
INGRID
Just do what I tell you.
EDWARD
You don’t want to look at me?
INGRID
Oh, come on. It’s my creation.
INGRID (CONT’D)
No, don’t.
EDWARD
What’s the problem?
INGRID
(laughing hysterically)
This is too fucked up.
EDWARD
What do you mean?
INGRID
You look ridiculous!
OSWALD (O.S)
Edward!
OSWALD (CONT’D)
You probably don’t remember me. I
was -
EDWARD
Yeah.
OSWALD
Oswald.
EDWARD
Hi.
NICK
“Edward?” What’s going on?
EDWARD
It’s no - nothing - no one.
OSWALD
“I only play Edward on TV.” That’s
a horrible joke. What are you
called in civilian life?
NICK
Fabio.
EDWARD
Guy.
MARIANA
Guy Moratz.
CLAY
This is all very mysterious. What
secret intel have you got on our
enigmatic friend?
      OSWALD
Only that your dear Mr. Moratz is
starring in a soon-to-be-classic
theatrical production.
MARIANA
Starring - like as an actor?
EDWARD
No, no, it’s...just a little...off-broadway...play...
MARIANA
Oh, thanks for letting me know, it
makes me feel very close to you.
OSWALD
Have I put my foot in my mouth?
NICK
What’s this play about?
EDWARD
It’s...hard to...it’s about...a
guy...
He’s just...
OSWALD
Your friend plays a man with a
disfigured face. Name of Edward.
NICK
Disfigured face?
OSWALD
He dons a very convincing mask.
EDWARD
It’s still being perfected...
prototype...
OSWALD
It’s a sort of beauty and the beast
yarn, or am I wrong?
EDWARD
That’s one way of...
CLAY
Beauty and the Beast, a classic.
EDWARD
No, it’s called -
      OSWALD
It’s called just “Edward” I
believe, which presumably makes you
the star of the show.
CLAY
Our Guy, a Broadway star?
EDWARD
Off-Broadway.
OSWALD
Just the first stop on the road to
glory.
NICK
How long has this been going on,
you prick?
EDWARD
Not￾OSWALD
He’s brilliant, I only saw a
little, but I was gobsmacked, I
must say.
MARIANA
He’s leading a double life, I knew
it.
OSWALD
Guy, my friend, I’m beginning to
think I’ve made a mess of things
for you.
CLAY
You’ve outed him. Look how
embarrassed￾EDWARD
I’m not...embarrassed...
OSWALD
Embarrassing people, that’s a
speciality of mine, for better or
worse.
MARIANA
He’s always embarrassed. Nervous
Nelly, I call him.
      OSWALD
No shame in that, my dear friend.
Actors are self-conscious sorts,
it’s their God-given temperament.
CLAY
Do you want to sit down, Oswald?
OSWALD
Oh no, my friend over there is no
doubt eagerly anticipating my
triumphant return. I’m terribly
sorry for the interruption, and a
million apologies if I was the
cause of any discomfiture. It was
not my place to reveal your
secrets. A fantastic pleasure, see
you on the stage Sir Guy, I’ll be
cheering you on from the front row.
Cheerio.
OSWALD (CONT’D)
I’m truly mortified by my
recklessness, I hope there’s no
hard feelings. I just hoped to let
you know how much I admired your
performance.
EDWARD
It’s no - thanks -
OSWALD
I’m off then!
NICK
Bye, Oswald!
NICK (CONT’D)
(clears his throat)
So, Edward...
EDWARD
Don’t call me that.
NICK
Does this mask have your little
pockmark thing?
      CLAY
I liked that guy’s accent. Is he
from around here?
INGRID
I can’t believe what I’m hearing.
EDWARD
I just don’t understand. He speaks
to the audience in these long
philosophical monologues, but then
when he talks to Fiona, he’s
monosyllabic.
INGRID
You want more lines? You can’t even
memorize the ones you have.
EDWARD
And why does he have to be so
grateful to her? It’s like, just
because his face is - he’s
indebted to her just for talking to
him.
INGRID
He - he isn’t grateful. He’s
nervous because he hasn’t had a lot
of experience.
EDWARD
How do you know what kind of
experience he’s had?
INGRID
Are you fucking serious, man?
EDWARD
Maybe he’s had a rich life. We
don’t know his backstory.
INGRID
I think I know my own character’s
“backstory,” thank you very much.
      EDWARD
And then he has to go kill himself,
‘cause of course he’s so depressed
because he’s deformed.
VIVIAN
Look who I ran into!
OSWALD
Guy! My good fellow. Grand to see
you again.
INGRID
Do you two know each other?
OSWALD
I drunkenly descended upon him as
he was celebrating with his real
estate mates, a lovely bunch.
I neglected to mention, I might be
in the market for a flat myself.
INGRID
Real estate mates?
OSWALD
(to Ingrid)
I’m Oswald, by the way.
INGRID
I’m Ingrid.
OSWALD
Ah, the brilliant scribe!
INGRID
And director.
OSWALD
Ah, la maestra!
      INGRID
We’re just rehearsing, you should
stick around and watch.
OSWALD
Ah, no, I fear I might develop a
reputation for intruding where I’m
not wanted.
INGRID
Nonsense, you’re more than wanted!
Though it’ll be nerve-wracking for
us, the play is still nascent.
Nothing set in stone.
OSWALD
Everyone’s so self-conscious in
show business, I adore it. I
confess I am intrigued by the whole
process.
INGRID
Well, you’re - please - unless
you’re busy.
OSWALD
I just had my Jiu-Jitsu lesson, so
I’m a tad sweaty, but otherwise, I
was just going to read in the park.
INGRID
What are you reading?
OSWALD
It’s called “The Bluest Eye,” by
Toni Morrison.
INGRID
One of my favorite books.
OSWALD
Strangely enough, I was inspired to
read it by Guy. He has those
piercing blue eyes, and I saw him,
and thought “that reminds me...”
INGRID
Funny, I never noticed your eyes,
Guy. Well, have a seat anywhere you
want. It’ll be boring. Stopping and
starting...
OSWALD
You won’t know I’m here.
      INGRID
Okay. Where were we? Guy? Guy?
OSWALD
I was sad to see him off himself at
the end.
INGRID
It’s a tragedy.
OSWALD
Yes, I suppose there’s nothing to
be done about it. I quite liked
Edward, though he is a rather
passive chap. At least until that
suicide. Naturally, I wanted to see
him live happily ever after with
Fiona. Would the audience believe
it?
FIONA
I love your accent.
OSWALD
I hear that a lot. You Yanks can’t
resist my mellifluous vocal
stylings. Back home, I’m just
another bloke. Nobody takes any
notice of me. You should think
about Edward having an accent. Your
critics will think it’s a very
classy endeavor.
INGRID
Great idea. Guy, talk like Oswald.
EDWARD
I can’t.
OSWALD
(exaggerating his own
accent)
’ello matey, ow’s the ol’ lady
doin’?
EDWARD
I can’t.
      INGRID
Sure you can. ’ello matey.
EDWARD
(terrible)
‘ello matey.
OSWALD
That’s great! ’ow’s tricks, guv?
EDWARD
(still terrible)
’ow’s tricks, guv?
INGRID
That’s horrible.
OSWALD
It could use some mild refinement,
but we’ll get there.
EDWARD
(angry)
You do an American accent.
OSWALD
I can do German too.
INGRID
That’s brilliant.
(to Edward)
Why can’t you do that?
OSWALD
Well, you’re not playing Master
Harold after all.
INGRID
(to Edward)
I guess they didn’t teach you
accents at Juilliard.
OSWALD
Really Guy, I developed an affinity
for them because I moved around a
lot as a child. (MORE)
A survival instinct, really, which
blossomed into one of my many
useless talents.
INGRID
What are your other talents?
OSWALD
Well, I can yodel -
I can juggle. Children’s games,
mere fluff. I can sing and play
guitar, though I’m no Segovia. I’ve
taken up weaving, I’m ashamed to
say.
INGRID
What can’t you do?
OSWALD
Oh, so many things. I can’t
whistle.
INGRID
I can teach you.
(she whistles)
You just -
OSWALD AND INGRID
-put your lips together and blow.
They both laugh hysterically.
OSWALD
I don’t drive very well.
INGRID
Can you act?
INGRID
He’s right. Edward is too passive.
EDWARD
What does he know about Edward?
      INGRID
I’ve made him a victim. I’ve fallen
into the most obvious trap.
EDWARD
So, what’s he supposed to be, a
hero? An inspiration?
INGRID
I don’t know. He’s just...Edward.
Look, you wanted more lines. You
said it yourself.
EDWARD
Yeah, and you called me a prima
donna. But, oh, if Oswald says
it...
INGRID
Come on.
EDWARD
The guy who killed Lincoln.
INGRID
What?
EDWARD
Oswald.
INGRID
Kennedy. Oswald killed Kennedy.
EDWARD
Whatever. Lincoln, right, a
disgruntled actor killed that guy.
Right there in the theater, right?
Hinkley.
INGRID
Booth.
EDWARD
Right there in the booth.
MAKEUP ARTIST
I’m sorry, this must feel very
dehumanizing.
Edward looks agog at himself, a bastardized version of his
former self. He reaches up to touch his face.
MAKEUP ARTIST (CONT’D)
Uh-uh- it’s very fragile.
EDWARD
Oh, my head...
FIONA
What is it? Here, sit down.
EDWARD
No, don’t touch me, just leave me
alone!
FIONA
But I’m only trying -
EDWARD
I know, always so helpful, aren’t
you? I don’t want your pity. I know
that I disgust you.
FIONA
That isn’t true!
EDWARD
You think I don’t know what your
little friends say about me? “Why
do you hang out with that, that
freak. He’ll get the wrong idea.”
But you...you’re the worst of
all...with your kindness and caring
and fussing and...God, how I hate
you.
OSWALD
Sir Guy!
EDWARD
What are you doing here?
OSWALD
Yoga in the park.
OSWALD (CONT’D)
Do you practice yoga?
EDWARD
No.
OSWALD
It might do you some good. They say
it’s very relaxing.
EDWARD
Yeah?
OSWALD
Confidentially, I find it rather a
chore, but supposedly it works
wonders with our withering bodies.
I think I’ve noticed some benefit,
but maybe it’s just the placebo
effect.
OSWALD
Would you just look at that?
OSWALD
Oh, I nearly forgot, they did the
mock-up today, yeah?
OSWALD (CONT’D)
Latex, is it? How did it go?
EDWARD
You heard about that.
OSWALD
Ingrid was very stressy about it.
Came off, I hope?
OSWALD (CONT’D)
Does it have the desired effect?
EDWARD
It’s still...
OSWALD
A work-in-progress? It will take a
bit of refinement over time. That’s
what Murray said, the make-up
artist. He’s part Northern Irish. He said it was the most complicated
thing he’s ever done. I’m excited
to see it in action. Part of me
wants to just wait until opening
night, so I can be struck by the
full effect, but I think I’ll stop
by tomorrow because Ingrid wanted
some feedback on the new pages, and
besides, I want to see the gang.
EDWARD
You don’t have work?
      OSWALD
I don’t really work, to be frank. I
made some lucky investments while I
was at university - before I ran
off to Tangiers with my professor -
and then I got into the real estate
game, briefly. The market - not the
side of it you’re on. I’ve done
quite well for myself, but I’m
happiest when I’m busy, and I’m
currently working on a thing - not
worth getting into, but it has to
do with bringing fresh water to
third world countries. I have some
very prominent people on board but
time will tell if it all comes
together. Right now I’m looking for
a place in the city - I wanted to
have a chat with you about that -
(excited)
Oh, can I believe my eyes?
SADIE
Oswald! You owe me dinner.
OSWALD
I feel ashamed.
SADIE
(to Edward)
Hi, I’m Sadie.
EDWARD
Hey.
OSWALD
That’s Guy, he’s a masterful actor.
SADIE
Oh no. I have bad luck with actors.
OSWALD
We’re working on a play together.
SADIE
You never stop, do you?
(to Edward)
Oswald is one of my favorite
people.
OSWALD
Look, I’ll ring you next week,
okay?
SADIE
I’ll believe it when I see it.
She whispers in his ear.
SADIE (CONT’D)
Nice to meet you, Guy.
(indicating Oswald:)
Watch out for this one.
EDWARD
Who was that?
OSWALD
I know how it looked, but, don’t
get any ideas -
EMCEE (O.S.)
Oswald!
OSWALD
Ah, cheer me on, mate.
EDWARD
I’m not Edward anymore?
OSWALD
You are, but only after his
transformation.
EDWARD
What is he talking about?
INGRID
Well, I’ve been thinking about -
and to your credit, Guy, you were
right - and Oswald too - the
suicide was...ludicrous. This
wasn’t meant to be a tragic love
story. Why can’t they be happy? And
Oswald and I were talking about
Beauty and the Beast, and how in
the end, he becomes a beautiful
prince.
EDWARD
A prince?
OSWALD
And you’re that prince!
EDWARD
And you’re the beast?
OSWALD
Not a beast. I’m Edward. This isn’t
beauty and the beast.
INGRID
That was just by way of explaining.
EDWARD
I don’t understand why he
transforms. How is that possible?
INGRID
He doesn’t transform, not
literally.
OSWALD
She just sees him differently!
      EDWARD
Why?
INGRID
You know how we idealize people
when we’re in love.
EDWARD
So I’m the idealized version of
Oswald?
OSWALD
Not me. Edward.
EDWARD
Why can’t it just be him? Why does
she have to idealize him so that
he’s somebody he isn’t?
INGRID
Frankly, Guy, to keep you in the
play. Look, this is hard for me
but, you know I need Oswald to be
Edward. And he refused unless there
was a part for you, because he -
loves you - and didn’t want it to
be like he was...replacing you. And
this is what we came up with. You
should really be thanking Oswald.
OSWALD
(sadly)
Guy...
INGRID
This is my decision. I had to beg
him to do it. Look, it’s not you,
Guy, but, come on, the mask, the
makeup, it’s a total bust, and
Oswald...I mean...
OSWALD
Ingrid insisted and...I admit, I do
feel that this is a uniquely rare
opportunity where I was, in a
sense, born to play the role.
INGRID
You’re selling yourself short. You
could play Hamlet.
OSWALD
She’s a canny director, flattering
me.
      INGRID
Frankly, Guy, we’ve been making all
these changes and you’ve had
trouble memorizing all the new
lines.
EDWARD
I haven’t, I just, it’s a process--
INGRID
Whereas Oswald has a photographic
memory.
OSWALD
I do have a photographic memory,
technically, but it remains to be
seen if that comes in handy in this
department.
INGRID
You already know your lines.
OSWALD
The lines, sure, but can I act?
That is the question!
INGRID
You can. He can. You’ve seen it.
We’ve all seen it. Oswald’s a
natural. If it’s right, it’s right.
EDWARD
You know the lines? You’ve seen him
act? When did all this happen?
INGRID
Well, he’s been giving me feedback
and...
OSWALD
Guy, you’re a masterful actor.
That’s what’s so tragic here, and I
really don’t know what the ethical
thing is.
INGRID
The right thing is for you to take
the role. And Guy, you still get to
play Edward...transformed...and you
don’t have to hide your face behind
that idiotic thing, so you’ll get
more recognition.
      EDWARD
For...one scene?
OSWALD
But what a scene! The finale!
EDWARD
Nobody is gonna believe that Edward
looks like him, and then suddenly
he looks like me.
OSWALD
It’s magic!
EDWARD
But she loves him for who he is. If
he changes, who is he then?
INGRID
The same person.
OSWALD
Same chap, new face.
EDWARD
That’s a different person!
VIVIAN
It’s a metaphorical change. Right
out of Beauty and the Beast. She
loves him, so voila, he appears
beautiful to her.
FIONA
But he had pretended to be a beast
to prove her love. He didn’t want
to be loved for his looks.
VIVIAN
No, she loves him because he’s a
beast.
INGRID
Or in spite of his beastliness.
EDWARD
They’re talking about you like
you’re a beast!
OSWALD
They’re talking about Edward.
EDWARD
Edward is not a beast!
OSWALD
No, of course not, no. But if
Beauty and the Beast is our
hypothetical point of comparison,
well...I mean, let’s be honest with
ourselves, old friend.
EDWARD
Come on, I’m tired, let’s go home.
INGRID
I’m not going home. Have a drink.
Don’t be mopey.
EDWARD
I don’t feel like a drink.
INGRID
That’s not my problem. Come or go,
it’s up to you.
OSWALD
(to Edward:)
What are you having?
EDWARD
Get a good look?
TEENAGER
Sorry, come again?
EDWARD
I said “get a good look?”
TEENAGER
A good look? Here, let me make
sure. (MORE)
Yeah - everybody back me up - see
if we can assess this man properly.
EDWARD
Why don’t you take a picture?
TEENAGER
That’s an excellent idea.
TEENAGER (CONT’D)
Well, isn’t that a nice picture,
but let’s see if we can get a smile
out of you. Smile, dude, make love
to the camera, say cheese.
TEENAGER (CONT’D)
Back off, or I’ll make your face
something worth looking at. All
right, I’m posting your picture.
You should have smiled. There, it’s
posted. Now all my followers are
gonna look at you. I got 673
followers. They’re all getting a
good look at you right now. What
are they gonna think?
      OSWALD
At first the thought terrified me-
that my face might be disseminated
to screens across the world, that
no matter the hour, someone was
seeing me, laughing at me,
horrified by me, even after I’m
dead, my image would remain for
others to despise. But then...
somehow this idea gave me comfort -
that it wasn’t me they were
laughing at, that I wouldn’t even
know, that I wouldn’t have to face
my tormentors - they’d be laughing
at someone else, someone different.
BELCHER
You’re in the show, right? Loved
it. Congratulations. Ron Belcher.
EDWARD
Thanks.
BELCHER
That guy’s amazing. I gotta be
honest with you, I thought it was
make-up. I said to my wife - it’s
our anniversary - this is her
JANET
Pleasure! Janet Belcher.
BELCHER
I was saying to her, how’d they do
that makeup? What is that, some
kind of polymer? Where’d they get
the budget for this? She said, I
think that’s his face. I said,
noooo babe, you’re nuts...it’s
gotta be some sort of get-up. The
whole time I’m watching the show,
I’m wondering, is that real or is
this some kind of weird effect? I
couldn’t really believe it either
way. I didn’t know what I even
wanted it to be.
WIFE
I could tell right away, that’s his
face.
BELCHER
You were right, I was wrong. What
was it like working with him?
EDWARD
It was...I mean...
BELCHER
I guess under all that, he’s just a
normal guy. I wonder if the fellow
who wrote the play knew him before
he wrote it, or if he just came up
with a character like that on his
own and hoped the right person
would come along by chance. Seems
risky to me. How would you go about
finding that guy - looks exactly
like you envisioned, and can act
too? How do you describe him? What
if they want to put the play on in
Boise? Do they fly that guy out?
What if he’s dead? Do they find the
Idaho version of him? Do they use a
mask? Will that be convincing? Will
another guy with some other
affliction do just as well? Maybe
they just cast a regular guy, like
me or you, the way they do
Shakespeare now with black people,
and it puts a kind of different
spin on it. I’m thinking about all
these things during the
performance.(MORE)
      To be honest with you, three hours
ago I’m saying to myself, do I
really want to go sit in an un-air-conditioned theater for god knows
how long to see some little play
I’ve never heard of? I don’t go to
the theater usually, I didn’t know
what the hell this thing was about,
but it’s our anniversary. And now
I’m thinking all this shit. So
that’s how I know it’s an
interesting play.
INGRID
I’m sorry, Guy. It doesn’t work.
You said it yourself, how can he
become you? You’re nothing alike.
It’s not believable. And it’s not
necessary. She loves him for who he
is. It was contrived.
OSWALD
I still think the idea is
theoretically sound, but what we
didn’t count on, and this may stem
from my being a novice, is how the
audience has spent two hours
becoming invested in Edward - that
is, in this particular iteration of
the piece, me - and if someone else
comes out and says “Oh, I’m Edward
now,” it doesn’t matter who it is,
even if it’s Sir Kenneth Branagh or
whomever, the audience feels
cheated, we’ve broken our pact with
the them, and they will rightfully
rebel.
INGRID
Look, I still want to be friends
and I’ll keep you in for future
projects. I’m sorry. Goodbye, Guy.
EDWARD
The mask is mine, I’m keeping it.
OSWALD
I always liked that mask. Brilliant
mask.
EDWARD
Where’s the blind guy?
INGRID
What do you want?
EDWARD
Why are you so upset?
INGRID
Why are you here?
EDWARD
Why was Oswald here?
INGRID
How did you - and what business is
it of yours?
EDWARD
I know because I know, I was
passing by-
      INGRID
I don’t have to explain myself to
you.
EDWARD
What do you know about him? Who is
he? Is his name even Oswald? Let me
tell you something. He’s got a kid,
and a girl, he was kissing this
other girl, and they were playing
in the park. He’s leading a double
life, what do you think of that?
INGRID
All right - first of all - that’s
Jolie, Oswald’s ex-wife, the mother
of his child Simon, they’re still
very close friends. As it happens,
Oswald was here because- he’s
moving in across the way...Mr.
Sablosky had an accident, Oswald
has been needing a place, so I
don’t know why I’m even bothering
to explain this to you. I don’t
think we have anything more to say
to each other. I’m sorry.
EDWARD
So, do we fancy a flat like this
perhaps?
EDWARD
(British accent)
Naturally, it’s a bit
disappointing, but I do hope we can
all remain on friendly terms. I’ve
no hard feelings personally.
EDWARD (CONT’D)
(British accent)
I’ll miss you most of all, darling.
      FIONA
Maybe we’ll ride to glory together.
OSWALD
Sounds all right to me, darling.
EDWARD
I think you’re kissing my girl.
OSWALD
(to the audience)
I do believe my understudy has had
too much to drink.
EDWARD
Understudy?
OSWALD
Why don’t we chat about this after
this performance, old chap?
FIONA
This is all part of the
performance, people!
EDWARD
I’m Edward! You’re not Edward!
OSWALD
That’s right. You’re Edward. Now
let’s -
EDWARD
That’s my red door! That’s my
couch! These were my lines! Things
I said!
OSWALD
Now - Edward -
EDWARD
Take yours off! You take yours off!
He pulls on Oswald’s face. They wrestle.
OSWALD
Guy!
OSWALD (CONT’D)
(crying)
Guy! What have I done? Sometimes I
don’t know my own strength!
DOCTOR FLEXNER
My life’s work, Edward. My baby.
This was Nobel Prize-level. We
could have been the subject of a
documentary! You, you could be one
of the most important patients in
the annals of medicine. They shut
it all down. They couldn’t prove
anything, they didn’t have access
to the body, but they said it was
too dangerous. How are you enjoying
your new life? I could kill you!
      OSWALD
Dear Guy. Can you ever forgive me?
Sometimes I don’t know my own
strength. I never should have
meddled. I betrayed a friend. You
were the perfect Edward. I’m so
ashamed. But don’t worry. We’ll
take care of you.
FAMOUS FILM ACTOR
(to Oswald)
I know I keep saying this, but it’s
such an honor, man.
OSWALD
The honor is ours completely.
INGRID
We couldn’t be more excited.
FAMOUS FILM ACTOR
I mean, frankly, I think you should
play it.
OSWALD
Wouldn’t dream of it.
FAMOUS FILM ACTOR
Honestly, I think you’ve got
something special, real charisma.
But they need a name to fund these
things, as you know. But it’s very
important to me to get it right, so
I just wanted to spend time with
you and, not study, really-observe, ask questions.
      OSWALD
Research as they say in the biz.
You can ask anything, you can
observe away, look through my e-mails, my old love letters, my
underwear drawer, I’m an open book,
you can have my porn passwords-
FAMOUS FILM ACTOR
Right on.
OSWALD
But I think you should feel free to
interpret it as you want, make it
more interesting than just, you
know, me. It isn’t even me, I’m
Oswald. Edward was conceived by
Ingrid. And what I was doing,
really Guy here pioneered. Whatever
you saw in my performance that you
liked, we really owe to him. I’m
interpreting Guy interpreting
Ingrid, and you’re just the next
and final step in the evolutionary
process.
FAMOUS FILM ACTOR
(to Edward)
That’s really cool, man. I’d love
to ask you questions too. It’s
really cool. Kind of a
collaborative thing.
INGRID
So they’ll be using a mask, or make￾up of some sort?
FAMOUS FILM ACTOR
I don’t know, that’s beyond my pay
grade. I’m not really part of those
discussions. They can do a lot
these days, make it pretty real.
But I don’t worry about that stuff,
I think as long as I do my job
getting Edward right, it’ll come
through, the rest is just icing.
OSWALD
Very true.
NICK
That’s a cool typewriter.
OSWALD
You can have it!
INGRID
Have to do some shopping. Anyone
need anything?
OSWALD
Well, I’m off. Anyone need
anything?
INGRID
(laughs)
I just asked.
OSWALD
Oh well, ring me if you do. Toodle￾loo.
INGRID
I’ll walk you out.
OSWALD
(to Edward)
Okay, we’ll get out of your hair.
I’ll be back around eight.
PHYSICAL THERAPIST
What the fuck is going on in here?
What’s going on with his face?
Fuck! Is he rich or something?
What’s she...is she...that was the
craziest shit I ever saw.
OSWALD
I forgot my charger. Sorry, sorry,
sorry.
PHYSICAL THERAPIST
(overly friendly)
It’s cool, man.
PHYSICAL THERAPIST (CONT’D)
(to Edward)
Let’s pause for a second, I gotta
use the bathroom. You keep going,
you got it.
PHYSICAL THERAPIST (CONT’D)
(loudly)
Mind if I grab one of these
seltzers?
OSWALD (O.S.)
I heard noises.
BASKETBALL PRISONER (O.S.)
My bad.
RAGGED MAN
Hey man, nice shoes. Where’s Fort
Lee, man? New Jersey? Where’s your
manners? Man, you must have had
some ugly parents. I hope you die
of cancer, and your ugly children
die of cancer, and your whole ugly
bloodline of ugly degenerates is
wiped off the face of God’s
beautiful earth.
OSWALD
(overjoyed)
Can I believe my eyes?
OSWALD
Do you remember Fiona? She got ALS.
Did you know?
EDWARD
No, my god.
OSWALD
It was just horrible.
INGRID
We adopted Lucie, her daughter,
who’s - it’s crazy to even say it -
in grad school now.
OSWALD
Guy, you need to come see the show.
When are you free? Tomorrow?
INGRID
Don’t pressure him.
OSWALD
He wants to come. Right, Guy?
EDWARD
Yeah - sure- of course.
OSWALD
Tomorrow, then?
EDWARD
Uh, what time?
OSWALD
Eight p.m. sharp.
EDWARD
All right.
      OSWALD
You’ll sit with me.
EDWARD
You’re not in it?
OSWALD
Oh, no, no, no. I’m no actor. Well,
yes, of course, Edward, but that
was-
INGRID
What a piece of shit. I don’t even
allow people to perform it anymore.
OSWALD
Oh, come now. It was a very
precocious “early work.” And it
brought us together so it served a
very noble purpose.
INGRID
Thank God they didn’t make that
movie.
OSWALD
I was disappointed, I wanted to see
that guy play me. Anyway, you’ll
love the new show. I think it’s her
finest work.
INGRID
Going out on a high note.
OSWALD
Time will tell. You see, it’s
brilliant that we ran into you,
because we’re leaving next month
after the play wraps.
EDWARD
Where are you going?
OSWALD
We’re moving up to Canada. It’s,
uh, it’s a place called Shepperton.
Do you know of it? It’s - I guess
you might call it a nudist colony.
      INGRID
That’s only a small part of it, but
yes, clothing is- I mean, it’s
allowed, for visitors, and in
winter, but...basically, we’ll
be...
OSWALD
As the Lord intended us to be.
EDWARD
Why?
INGRID
It’s a long story. We met this
woman, when we were -
OSWALD
Traveling through the Andes.
INGRID
- and it turns out she’s this
amazing person, with followers and
all that, and there’s a sort of
ecological philosophy-
OSWALD
Plus free love.
INGRID
Yes, but, also-
OSWALD
Not to mention, LSD.
INGRID
Sometimes, yes, but...
OSWALD
Have you done LSD, Guy?
EDWARD
Should I?
OSWALD
Well, I don’t know, probably-
INGRID
I’m not sure he could handle it.
OSWALD
He’d need a proper guide. Which I
happen to be.
      INGRID
Recently certified.
EDWARD
What about, like, bad trips?
OSWALD
Always a possibility, yes, but
those can be the most enlightening,
it’s all about how you frame it,
Guy.
EDWARD
Are your kids going?
OSWALD
No, no, alas.
INGRID
They say it’s a cult.
OSWALD
I’m sure Guy thinks it’s a cult as
well. Right, Guy?
EDWARD
I guess it sounds a little like a
cult.
OSWALD
Yes, in broad strokes it does, but
it’s really quite leaderless. It’s
a radical lifestyle, one that I
think will suit us as we get on up
there in years.
EDWARD
But what about this Andes woman,
isn’t she the leader?
INGRID
The founder, yes. She set it in
motion. Not a guru in the - well, a
sort of guru, yes, in the purest
sense. See, we can’t talk about it
without sounding...
OSWALD
Totally bonkers.
INGRID
Honestly, it’s, as far as I’m
concerned, it’s paradise.
OSWALD
Paradise, it really is. Utopia, the
closest thing.
EDWARD
What about your career?
INGRID
I’ve accomplished everything I ever
wanted. I’m ready for the next
phase.
OSWALD
Now she just wants to do LSD and
fuck all the time! Anyway - he’s
going to go home and tell his
friends how batty we’ve become. I
know how it sounds, that’s why I
invite people up, people can see
for themselves, and stay as long as
they like. But what’s going on with
you?
INGRID
Tell us everything.
EDWARD
Well, I mean...I don’t know.
SERVER
Do we know what we’d like tonight?
OSWALD
Edward, what are you having?
EDWARD
You go - I’m still....
OSWALD
We’ll need more sake. We’re
celebrating. Another bottle of the
Dassai Hayata. For the table,
wakame, the agedashi tofu, and he
needs to try the uni toast. And an
order of hamachi kama, why not. And
then for my entree, the wagyu
flight.
INGRID
The miso black cod for me.
SERVER
(to Edward)
And you, sir?
EDWARD
Uh...uh...
SERVER
Do you need a minute?
EDWARD
Uh...I...er...
OSWALD
Ah, my dear old friend, you haven’t
changed a bit!
