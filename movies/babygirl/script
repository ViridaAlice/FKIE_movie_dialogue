INT. ROMY AND JACOB’S APARTMENT- BEDROOM NIGHT
Close on: a woman’s face, ROMY (49). Pure ecstasy. She holds
her breath, lets go and and starts to orgasm. The camera
reveals her husband JACOB (58, warm, handsome) who is laying
underneath her and climaxes at the same time. He is in heaven
as she leans down and brings her face close to his.
JACOB
I love you.
ROMY
(warm)
Love you.
Lovingly, she kisses him. He turns over and falls asleep. A
beat. Romy’s eyes are restless. Quietly, she gets out of bed.
INT. ROMY AND JACOB’S APARTMENT- LONG HALLWAY TO BEDROOMS -
NIGHT
Quickly, Romy walks to her study.
INT. ROMY AND JACOB'S APARTMENT- STUDY NIGHT
Romy sneaks into her study, and opens her laptop. The screen
lights up the otherwise dark room. She types quickly, then
takes the laptop from the desk, and puts it down on the
floor. She lies down on her belly in front of it. She faces
the computer. She clicks on one of the video’s. Her hand
moves towards her crotch. On the screen Romy sees:
Close on a WOMAN’s face. She answers questions from a man who
is filming her.
MAN
(whispers)
How does daddy use you?
WOMAN
Anyway he pleases..
MAN
Louder.
WOMAN
Any way he pleases.
Romy sees how the couple on her screen start to have rough
sex. She covers her mouth with her hand, while she pleasures
herself until she comes. For real this time.

Immediately after she climaxes, she closes the laptop. The
room goes dark.
Over black, the title:
BABYGIRL
INT. AUTOMATED WAREHOUSE-DAY
An overhead shot of a fully automated warehouse. Robots are
driving over a system of rails and magnetic tape, picking and
placing products in thousands of boxes. It is as if we are
looking inside Romy’s head.
INT. ROMY AND JACOB'S APARTMENT BATHROOM-EARLY MORNING
Close on Romy’s face. She applies toner, hyaluronic acid, day-
cream. She uses a Dermaflash tool to smoothen her skin. She
plucks her eyebrows. She taps her face with her fingers. She
applies bright pink blush to her cheeks. A mask of make up.
As she goes through her routine, she practices a speech.
ROMY
(mumbling quietly)
Unmatched order, accuracy and
efficiency....to transform
warehouses into future ready
opportunity centers....An increase
in e-commerce and fast shipping
expectations- in the face of real
estate and labour shortages...
INT. ROMY AND JACOB’S APARTMENT- KITCHEN EARLY MORNING
Classical music is playing. Before anyone wakes up, Romy sets
the breakfast table perfectly. She is wearing an apron.
Carefully, she prepares lunch boxes. She sits down to write
little notes for her daughters. She hides them in their
backpacks.
CUT TO:
Romy is serving pancakes. Her two daughters, ISABEL (15) and
NORA (13) sit at the table. Jacob is on the phone with an
actor joking and discussing the character of Lovborg in Hedda
Gabler. In front of him on the table, paper and a red pen.
Everyone is talking at once. We hear fragments of Jacob’s
phone conversation.
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 2.
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 3.
JACOB
Because Hedda wants him to end his
life courageously, romantically-
ISABEL
So what are you going to wear?
ISABEL (CONT’D)
(laughing)
Did you give them to Ed?
ROMY
Who’s Ed?
NORA
The homeless woman downstairs-
JACOB
(into the phone)
Exactly! Show that you’re
showing!
NORA (CONT’D)
I don’t need them. I’m a
dancer not a hiker.
ISABEL
(laughing)
We always hike, so you do need
them.
JACOB
(smiling, to his wife)
Why do you keep wearing that?
Romy looks at her apron. Jacob takes the pen and paper from
the table and walks away, laughing at a joke the actor makes
on the phone.
ROMY
(to Jacob about the
apron)
You don’t like it?
ISABEL
(to her sister)
You can’t come if you don’t
have hiking shoes. We’ll
leave you behind.
ROMY (CONT’D)
(to Nora)
The ones we bought last month? Did
you give them away?
NORA
Yes. They made me look weird.
ROMY
To a homeless person?
ISABEL
Ed.
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 3.
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 4.
ROMY
Did he fit them?
NORA
She.
ROMY
She!
ISABEL
Can Mary spend the night?
ROMY
(Decisive)
No!
Nora starts to move through the kitchen to practice the
tarantella. Automatically, Romy guides her back to her chair.
ISABEL
Why?
Jacob looks at Isabel and quickly hangs up.
JACOB
Your mother is busy with her
company right now. So we need peace
and quiet- It’s a scary time.
ROMY
(laughing)
It’s not scary, it’s exciting!
ISABEL
(imitating her mother’s
smile)
It’s not scary it’s exciting!
Jacob laughs. Romy, a bit offended, touches her necklace.
Jacob hands her the piece of paper with her speech on it.
JACOB
I made some small changes.
Playfully, Jacob grabs his wife and makes her giggle.
EXT. BUSY STREET IN MIDTOWN NEW YORK DAY
Romy walks down a very busy street. Suddenly, someone starts
to scream. People rush towards her. Anxious, she looks up to
see what they are running from. A barking DOG with wild eyes
runs towards her. People try to get away. Someone hides
behind a car. A man in a business suit tries to stop the dog.
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 4.
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 5.
MACHO MAN
(loud)
Hey! Calm the fuck down!
His voice only makes the animal more scared and
disorientated. The dog focusses his attention on a child.
Romy jumps in front of it. For a moment it seems hypnotized
by Romy’s fearlessness, but then it suddenly jumps on top of
her, causing her to trip and fall. Before it can bite her, it
is distracted by a whistling sound. The dog walks away from
her, into the direction of A YOUNG MAN, SAMUEL (25, in a
cheap suit and coat that seem too big for him) He looks
straight into the eyes of the dog, and holds out his hand.
Abruptly, it stops barking and walks curiously toward the
hand. While Romy gets herself together, she tries to see
what’s going on through the legs of the people around her.
EXT. / INT. OFFICE BUILDING ENTRANCE/ LOBBY- DAY
Romy rushes in. Someone is hanging decorations on a large,
beautiful Christmas tree. ESME, Romy’s assistant (25), comes
running.
INT. OFFICE BUILDING HALLWAY / MEETING ROOM DAY
Romy walks down the stairs in the middle of the busy office.
Esme follows carrying Romy’s bag and laptop.
ROMY (PRE-LAP)
Humans are the most ethical beings
on the face of the earth, but also
the least ethical. The state of our
planet proves it.
INT. OFFICE BUILDING PRESS ROOM DAY
On a screen behind Romy we see large mobile robots, picking
and placing products from shelves into boxes and containers.
The logo of her company: Tensile Automation, is projected
over the images. She speaks into a small camera. A live
stream of a product launch. Romy is introducing new robot
called Harvest. Some employees, technicians, and HAZEL (46,
head of marketing) are watching. A make up station, a
clothing rack and craft services table.
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 5.
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 6.
ROMY
As more and more artificial
intelligence is entering into the
world, more and more emotional
intelligence must enter into
leadership.” We are living through
an era of historic transformation,
unlocking sustainable, inclusive
growth in new sectors of the
economy. We are making the
workplace, healthier, safer and
more productive. We engineer
accountability into our products
and they are changing the way we
live, every day.
I am delighted to introduce to you,
the newest asset to our fleet:
HARVEST
She smiles into the camera. Music starts playing.
INT. OFFICE BUILDING ROMY'S OFFICE DAY
Esme knocks on the door and pops her head in. Romy jumps up
and tries to fix her hair.
ROMY
(smiling)
Response is great I hear.
ESME
(genuinely enthusiastic)
Yes! The quote about emotional
intelligence was very-
ROMY
Jacob’s idea.
ESME
Is this a good time for me to
introduce the... interns-
ROMY
(without thinking)
Now is good!
Through the glass we see a group of interns.
ESME
It’s their first day so-
Romy nods. Esme opens the door and lets the small group of
young men and women enter, among them Samuel.
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 6.
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 7.
ROMY
(enthusiastically)
Hello!
ESME (CONT’D)
This is our CEO, Romy Mathis!
No one speaks. Romy takes off her reading glasses. She smiles
kindly.
ROMY (CONT’D)
Don’t be nervous...Welcome! We are
so very happy to have you with us.
Relieved they smile back.
ROMY (CONT’D)
If you have any questions, let us
know.
She looks back at her laptop as a sign that they can leave.
Suddenly Samuel, hidden behind the other interns, in the back
of the room, raises his hand.
SAMUEL
I have a question.
Romy looks up. To her surprise she recognizes him as the boy
who calmed the dog down earlier that morning.
SAMUEL (CONT’D)
(without taking his eyes
off of her)
Do you really believe that
automation can provide a path to
sustainability or is that just
something people say to make you
like robots?
He smiles. Before Romy can answer, Esme quickly interrupts.
ESME
Ok! Lets go, Mrs. Mathis is very
busy today.
She guides the interns to the door. Romy stares at Samuel.
INTERN ROSE
(In Samuel’s ear)
It’s her company.
Samuel nods and smiles. Quickly, Esme escorts the group out.
Before Esme pushes him through the door, Samuel looks back at
Romy. Romy’s phone starts to ring. Before she leaves Esme
says:
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 7.
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 8.
ESME
I am so sorry about that, do you
want me to- (get rid of him?)
Romy isn’t listening. She answers her phone.
ROMY
(into the phone)
Yes?(...) Oh! Of course (...) we
should dissect that a little though-
It was an excellent day... a very
successful beginning-
Through the glass walls of her office, we see the interns
walk away. Samuel keeps his eyes on Romy.
INT. OFFICE BUILDING 6TH FLOOR NIGHT
The group of interns are getting a tour of the building.
Everyone is talking over each other. Tom and Esme explain how
the internship works and point out different area’s of the
office. Esme hands out bags with welcome packages. Samuel
takes it all in.
INTERN ANNA
So who can apply for it?
ESME
For what?
Everyone quiets down and listens.
TOM
Everyone. It’s a company wide
program. You’ll receive a list of
names by email at the end of the
day.
ESME
I highly recommend it. A mentor
makes a huge difference in how you
get to experience the company.
TOM
And you’re all invited to the
holiday party this Friday.
ESME
There will be a DJ, make sure you
bring your dancing shoes!
Everyone laughs and talks over each other.
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 8.
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 9.
INT. OFFICE BUILDING ELEVATOR- DAY
The next morning, Romy walks into the elevator. A group of
men in suits look at her.
ARI
Good Morning Mrs. Mathis.
ROMY
Good morning Ari.
INT. OFFICE BUILDING MEETING ROOM- LATE MORNING
Romy holds court for a group of business men.
ROMY (PRE-LAP)
He’s a problem... and we don’t need
him...
INT. OFFICE BUILDING DESKS/ 6TH FLOOR STAIRS/ CANTEEN COFFEE
MACHINE- DAY
Romy, with her coat on, walks through the office, she is on
the phone looking for someone.
ROMY
Exactly...that’s what I told him...
Investors appetite is huge...
As she passes people’s desks they look up from their screens.
She turns a corner and sees Samuel drinking water at the
coffee machine. Rose (Intern) is saying goodbye to him. As
Rose leaves:
ROMY (CONT’D)
(to Samuel)
Hey- Could you make me a coffee?
Quickly, Samuel nods and takes a cup from a shelf.
ROMY (CONT’D)
(into the phone)
Right- safe navigation,
flexibility...real time
monitoring...
(while looking at Samuel)
Technology alone wont solve that
though- Yes, okay- Talk later.
She hangs up as he hands her the coffee. She looks straight
into his eyes.
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 9.
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 10.
ROMY (CONT’D)
How did you get that dog to calm
down?
He observes her for a beat.
SAMUEL
(without blinking)
I gave it a cookie.
She raises her eyebrows.
ROMY
You always have cookies on you?
He smiles and nods.
SAMUEL
Yeah.
(he looks at her with a
twinkle in his eyes)
Why?
He sticks his hand in his pocket.
SAMUEL (CONT’D)
(cheeky)
Do you want one?
She shakes her head.
ROMY
(serious)
No.
For a brief moment he sees an unexpected vulnerability in her
eyes. He tilts his head, like an animal.
SAMUEL
(fatherly)
You shouldn’t drink coffee after
lunch. How many do you drink a day?
ROMY
None of your business.
(pause)
Seven.
They stand there silently for several seconds until her phone
rings, breaking the tension.
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 10.
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 11.
ROMY (CONT’D)
(into the phone but still
looking at Samuel)
Yes?
She walks away.
INT. ROMY AND JACOB'S APARTMENT BEDROOM- NIGHT
In the dark, in bed, Romy watches business news on her phone.
Jacob turns towards her and gently touches her shoulder.
JACOB
I want to see you.
He switches the light on. Romy looks away.
JACOB (CONT’D)
(whispers)
Look at me. Hey, hey look at me...
Romy playfully disappears under the sheets. She sits there
fully covered by the sheet like a ghost. Her childish
behavior makes him laugh. She speaks from under the sheets.
ROMY
(whispers, shy)
I want you to watch porn while you
have sex with me.
He thinks he didn't hear her correctly.
JACOB
What?
ROMY
I want to-
Embarrassed, she stops herself.
JACOB
Ok-
Romy giggles. Jacob starts to kiss her through the sheet.
ROMY
-feels weird.
Smiling, she takes the sheet away and lays on her back. She
grabs a pillow and puts it over her face. He stares at the
pillow. He shakes his head. Romy speaks from under the
pillow.
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 11.
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 12.
ROMY (CONT’D)
(softly, with a baby
voice)
You touch me.
He starts to caress her body.
ROMY (CONT’D)
No. Like this. You touch me.
She puts the pillow back over her head. He tries to caress
her again. He kisses her breasts. She moans.
ROMY (CONT’D)
Yes. Do it.
He moves away.
ROMY (CONT’D)
(from under the pillow)
Come on- Do it-
JACOB
(smiles)
You know I can’t- Like this.
She doesn't take the pillow away. He sighs.
JACOB (CONT’D)
It makes me feel like ...a villain.
ROMY
Okay...okay.
She takes the pillow away and kisses him. She tries to
surrender to him. Very gently they start to make love. Jacob
looks at her, she tries to keep her eyes focused on his.
INT. OFFICE BUILDING PRESS ROOM- DAY
Close on Romy, she looks straight into the camera.
ROMY
Being a CEO is- being a
collaborator- a nurturer. I see
myself as a strategy expert but
also- a human expert.
They are rehearsing for a press day. Esme is typing on her
phone. HAZEL is drilling Romy.
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 12.
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 13.
ROMY (CONT’D)
At the same time, one day shipping
dramatically upped the stakes. The
demand for what we do is huge.
People are waiting for us to buckle
under that pressure. The best thing
to do is, smile and look up. Never
show your weakness-
HAZEL
(interrupts her)
Don’t use “weakness” to describe
yourself. It’s a positive to be
vulnerable, not a negative–
Romy nods her head.
ROMY
Got it.
She smiles.
INT. OFFICE BUILDING 6TH FLOOR - END OF DAY
The office Christmas party. Music is playing. Everyone is
having a good time. Romy and Esme welcome Jacob and the
children. Isabel feels awkward in her girly dress. Nora is
comfortably wearing a princess dress. Immediately, they are
surrounded by people who want to greet Romy’s family. Female
employees try to get close to Jacob.
INT. OFFICE BUILDING 6TH FLOOR NIGHT
Later-Esme and Romy sit in a quiet corner. Esme is tipsy.
ROMY
Did you hear about those murders
uptown?
Esme nods.
ROMY (CONT’D)
Do you think a woman would be
capable of killing so many young
men?
ESME
It’s really good to like think
about death more.
ROMY
What?
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 13.
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 14.
ESME
I mean, to like bring awareness to
death more? Like that Buddhist
quote. “We don’t give enough
attention to the avalanche that
will cover us all, in a very short
time.”
ROMY
Well, you’re still an embryo, so
you shouldn't think about death at
all! Leave that to us dinosaurs.
ESME
Can I ask you- Where does your
first name come from? Is it Polish?
Romy observes her for a beat.
ROMY
(bluntly)
I was named by a guru.
ESME
What?? Seriously? How? When?
ROMY
I was raised in cults and communes.
Romy studies Esme’s face to check her reaction.
ESME
(smiling, a bit tipsy)
You were? I would have NEVER
guessed. I thought you were raised
by soldiers or something. Or
robots!
Romy looks at her.
ESME (CONT’D)
(afraid she overstepped)
I mean- I’m joking, of course.
Samuel walks by, he makes eye contact with Romy.
ROMY
Did you know him before?
Esme shakes her head and takes another sip from her wine.
ESME
Do you think I’m too young for
fillers?
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 14.
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 15.
ROMY
Why?
ESME
Barbara said I have a gummy smile.
ROMY
Who? That’s insane, I hope you
realize that.
Realizing how ridiculous it is, Esme smiles. Romy laughs.
EXT. OFFICE BUILDING TERRACE-NIGHT
In her coat, Romy is alone smoking a cigarette. Suddenly
Samuel appears.
SAMUEL
Do you have a lighter?
She hands him one. He lights his cigarette. They smoke and
look at the city below them, flickering with Christmas
lights.
SAMUEL (CONT’D)
(kind)
I don’t like Christmas. Do you?
She thinks about the question. After a beat, they start
talking at the same time.
ROMY
I have no- issues with it. SAMUEL (CONT’D)
You know what I read-
SAMUEL (CONT’D)
Sorry, you go first.
ROMY
(smiles)
No. You... Go.
They are quiet. He stares into her eyes. She doesn’t look
away.
SAMUEL
(as if he just remembered)
Oh! I chose you as my mentor.
ROMY
What?
SAMUEL
I chose you as my mentor.
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 15.
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 16.
She shakes her head while blowing out smoke.
ROMY
I’m not a part of that program.
SAMUEL
You are.
ROMY
No I’m not.
SAMUEL
(without taking his eyes
off of her)
You are. You’re on the list. I got
an email and I clicked on your
name.
(he smiles, a beat)
So- You’re on the list.
Samuel stubs out his cigarette.
SAMUEL (CONT’D)
Thank you for the light.
He walks away. Puzzled, Romy stays behind.
INT. OFFICE BUILDING 6TH FLOOR NIGHT
Later- people are dancing. Jacob is dancing with Nora and
Isabel. Nora tries to get her mother to join but she shakes
her head. MR. MISSEL (73, board of directors, fatherly) and
Romy’s eyes meet. He smiles at her refusal to dance with her
family. In a corner of the room, the interns talk to each
other. Samuel dances with an older woman. Romy watches him.
He takes off his jacket and tie. As he dances, his tie falls
to the ground.
INT. ROMY AND JACOB'S APARTMENT KITCHEN- NIGHT
Later that night- At home Jacob eats from a tub of Greek
vanilla yoghurt. The Hedda Gabler script in front of him.
Romy is typing on her phone.
JACOB
Scarlett doesn't understand Hedda
Gabler at all - She thinks it’s
about desire. It’s not about
desire, It’s about suicide.
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 16.
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 17.
ROMY
(distracted)
OK.
Romy looks at her phone.
JACOB
(changing the subject back
to Hedda)
Hedda’s life is over before the
play begins-
ROMY
(eyes fixated on her
screen, very distracted)
Right- Yes. Before it begins. It’s-
over. That makes- a lot of sense-
to me.
JACOB
What are you mumbling about? You’re
not saying any words- are you
having a seizure?
She laughs. She loves him when he teases her.
ROMY
(laughing)
You’re so rude-
JACOB
(flirty)
Who are you texting the whole time?
ROMY
(smiles)
When I’m on my phone it’s for work.
Especially now -you know that.
JACOB
(laughs)
As if that’s a good excuse! That’s
the whole problem!
He laughs.
JACOB (CONT’D)
Hey, come here.
He takes her in his arms. He looks into her eyes.
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 17.
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 18.
JACOB (CONT’D)
(half smiling, half
vulnerable)
Am I-- relevant to you as a
director?
ROMY
Everyone is irrelevant. We don’t
give enough attention to the
avalanche that will cover us all,
in a very short time.
JACOB
What?
They both laugh. He kisses her. They hug.
INT. OFFICE BUILDING HALLWAY - DAY
The next morning- it’s Saturday. Romy, with her coat on,
looks around. A caterer wheels out a cart of glassware. A
deflated balloon on the floor. The office is empty. A cleaner
is vacuuming. Romy takes a water from the fridge when out of
the corner of her eye, she spots Samuel’s tie on the floor
next to where everyone was dancing. She picks it up and puts
it in her bag.
INT. OFFICE BUILDING ROMY'S OFFICE DAY
Later- Romy is working on her laptop with her coat still on.
Business news plays loudly. She tries to focus but keeps
looking at her bag on the edge of the sofa. Hesitant, she
gets up. She lowers the blinds, to make sure no one can see
her. She sits down on the sofa. Unsure of herself, she takes
the tie out of her bag. She looks around before she smells
it. Slowly, she brings the tie to her mouth. Her hand moves
towards her skirt. She pushes the tie deeper into her mouth
while she starts to touch herself.
INT. REMEDY PLACE-DAY
Close up of Romy’s face. A needle is penetrating her upper
lip. Romy gets Botox and fillers. It hurts but she doesn't
mind.
DOCTOR
You sure you don’t want some
numbing cream?
She shakes her head.
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 18.
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 19.
INT. REMEDY PLACE- DAY
Romy lies in a hyperbaric oxygen chamber and works on her I-
Pad.
Romy submerges her body in a ice cold plunge tank.
Romy does cryotherapy wearing ear protectors , a black
bathing suit and large gloves. Her breath is visible in the
cold.
INT. EMDR THERAPY CLINIC/ UNDEFINED SPACES - DAY
Close on Romy’s face with headphones on. We hear the sound of
Audio Bilateral stimulation moving from our left ear to our
right. Up close we see her eyes move from left to right,
following a light-bar. Her wrists are stimulated every few
seconds by vibrating black wristbands, which she wears like
handcuffs.
THERAPIST
5,4,3,2,1...
Romy closes her eyes. Flashback to: Romy’s childhood. A group
of children dance wildly.
THERAPIST (CONT’D)
What do you feel?
Close on her eyes moving rapidly. We see a flash of Samuel’s
hands, feeding a treat to the dog on the street.
ROMY
Nothing.
A flash of the dog standing over Romy as she lays on the
street on her back.
THERAPIST
No feelings in your body?
INT. ROMY AND JACOB'S APARTMENT- LIVING ROOM- DAY
Through the lens of the photographer we see the family posing
for their yearly Christmas card picture next to their
tastefully decorated Christmas tree. A perfect American
nuclear family except for the fact that Nora is wearing her
traditional Tarantella dance dress, and Isabel is in an
oversized hoody with a scary print . The photographer is
taking the shot, when suddenly Romy isn’t able to restrain
herself any longer, and jumps up.
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 19.
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 20.
She pushes the photographer out of the way, stands behind the
camera and looks through the lens.
ROMY
Well- ok. We’ve got that-
(kindly)
Would you go change now Isabel,
please?
JACOB
Romy, come on. Jesus-
ROMY
You look beautiful, and we
have this shot, but it’s not
the style we are going for.
It’s not what we agreed upon.
JACOB (CONT’D)
Let them wear what they want!
ROMY (CONT’D)
(with a smile)
Go change please.
Suddenly, Isabel starts laughing.
ISABEL
Your face looks really weird!
Romy touches her lips. Her heart sinks. Nora looks at her mom
and bursts out laughing too.
ISABEL (CONT’D)
(laughing)
You look like a dead fish!
Hurt and embarrassed, Romy looks away.
JACOB
Isabel!
ISABEL
Sorry dad, but she looks awful!
(to her mom)
Why do you do that to yourself?!
Isabel storms off.
ROMY
(friendly, to Nora)
Baby, will you go get changed now
please?
Nora nods and leaves. Jacob gives his wife a look. Romy
smiles.
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 20.
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 21.
ROMY (CONT’D)
(to the photographer)
Ok! Why don’t you take one of the
two of us while we’re waiting for
them to change?
She smiles. Romy and Jacob pose together.
INT. OFFICE BUILDING ELEVATOR DAY
Monday morning; Romy walks into the elevator trying to hide a
small bruise caused by the fillers. The bruise is covered by
concealer, which makes it look worse. Self-conscious she
touches it.
SAMUEL O. S
Wait – hold the door-
Samuel walks in. Romy stands with her back against the wall.
Samuel stands next to her, at a respectful distance. She
looks at their reflection in the closing doors, she tries to
hide her face behind her hair. He looks at her.
SAMUEL
I’m looking forward to Tuesday.
ROMY
(confused)
Sorry?
SAMUEL
I got an email saying they
scheduled the first session.
ROMY
The what?
SAMUEL
The ten minute introduction
meeting?
She looks at him as if he has lost his mind.
ROMY
(trying to be polite)
I have no idea who sent you that
email but they’ll have to find
someone else. I don’t have time.
SAMUEL
It’s just ten minutes-
(he tilts his head and
stares at the bruise)
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 21.
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 22.
He points at her cheek.
SAMUEL (CONT’D)
What’s that?
ROMY
(pretending not to know)
What’s what?
He points at his own face.
SAMUEL
There’s no need for the-
Embarrassed she looks away.
SAMUEL (CONT’D)
Looks good on you.
With a loud ding the elevator stops. Blushing, she walks out.
Tom is waiting for her in the hallway. He stares at Samuel
through the elevator doors. Samuel stares back as the doors
close in front of him.
EXT/INT OFFICE TERRACE/ MEETING ROOM -DUSK
Esme sits alone on a bench. Samuel walks up to her and sits
down next to her. They talk and laugh.
From a window high above, Romy watches them.
INT. OFFICE BUILDING ROMY'S OFFICE- NIGHT
Esme is applying more concealer to Romy’s bruise.
ROMY
Who decided that I’m part of that
mentor program by the way?
ESME
Hazel thought it would be good for
you to take part in some extra
activities internally... They say
there’s a talent war-so I guess
it’s important to make new talent
feel involved. Show you’re an
approachable leader-
ROMY
Yes- The talent war-
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 22.
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 23.
They both laugh.
ESME
You think we can talk about my
promotion soon?
ROMY
(warm)
Of course-
Romy checks herself in a hand mirror.
EXT. NEW YORK CITY- EARLY MORNING.
From high above, the sun rises over the skyline.
INT. OFFICE BASEMENT HALLWAY- DAY
Romy walks along the empty hallway, towards basement meeting
room.
INT. OFFICE BUILDING WINDOWLESS BASEMENT ROOM- DAY
Nervous and excited, Samuel sits at a table, with a yellow
pad and a pen, waiting. A long beat before Romy comes in.
ROMY
You have seven minutes.
SAMUEL
Ten.
He gets up to shake her hand, but she ignores him.
SAMUEL (CONT’D)
Thank you so much for making the
time.
ROMY
(mumbles)
I was forced.
SAMUEL
Excuse me?
She gives him a look.
SAMUEL (CONT’D)
Why did you want to meet here?
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 23.
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 24.
ROMY
You don’t like this room?
SAMUEL
No. I do. It’s perfect.
He feels the wall.
SAMUEL (CONT’D)
It’s soundproof.
She stares at him, not knowing what to think.
ROMY
I would hurry up if I were you.
SAMUEL
Of course. So--- how- did- it-
start?
ROMY
What?
SAMUEL
The warehouse automation dream?
It’s an interesting choice
considering the climate crisis.
ROMY
That’s your question? Google it.
SAMUEL
I want to hear it from you.
ROMY
Why?
SAMUEL
Cause the internet is unreliable.
Briefly she looks into his eyes. Then she starts to speak at
a very fast pace.
ROMY
I graduated from Yale cum laude and
was recruited by an investment
firm. The selection process was
gruesome. There were six rooms, and
in every room, I had to answer
certain questions and solve math
formulas. One of the questions was
how many ping pong balls would fit
in that specific room.
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 24.
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 25.
SAMUEL
How many ping pong balls fit in
this room?
She ignores him.
ROMY
At the end they gave me a
hypothetical case of a company that
was in deep trouble, and I had to
figure out how to make them
profitable again. For a week I
tried to solve it, but I couldn’t,
so I went in and told them they
could go fuck themselves-
SAMUEL
What did they say?
ROMY
They hired me.
SAMUEL
Because you were bold?
ROMY
I guess they were looking for
certain personalities.
SAMUEL
What kind?
ROMY
(ignoring him)
I started my own company five years
later with the goal to change the
global supply chain forever. I
wanted to automate repetitive
tasks, to give people their time
back so they can spend it in a
fulfilling way–
SAMUEL
(interrupting her)
Power hungry personalities?
ROMY
You think that’s what I am?
SAMUEL
No, the opposite.
ROMY
You think I don't like power?
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 25.
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 26.
SAMUEL
(soft)
No. I think you like to be told
what to do.
The air the leaves the room. Samuel blushes, shocked at his
own words. Romy freezes.
SAMUEL (CONT’D)
Sorry. I didn’t mean to- that’s
inappropriate – that’s incredibly
inappropriate–
He smiles. Embarrassed, he looks at his yellow pad. He starts
to write. She stares at his hand moving extremely fast over
the paper, writing down all kinds of numbers. Suddenly she
grabs the pen out of hid hand. Surprised, he looks up. He
smiles as if he recognizes something. She writes down her
phone number on his yellow pad, before she hands the pen back
to him.
ROMY
(explaining herself,
trying to sound
indifferent)
Seven minutes are up, but we can do
another session- if that’s what you
were hoping for...
With kind eyes he looks at her phone number, and then at her.
SAMUEL
(about the phone number)
I already have it.
Confused she starts to walk to the door.
SAMUEL (CONT’D)
(about the ping pong
balls))
818007, is the answer.
Without looking back at him, she opens the door to leave.
Suddenly, he stands behind her. He slowly closes the door.
She lets him. She turns around to face him. Her lips are
almost touching his. Their mouths gradually near each other.
ROMY
I have to go.
When her lips almost touch his, he pulls back. Her breathing
sounds loud. They stand like that for a while, until she
can’t control herself any longer. Suddenly, she kisses him.
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 26.
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 27.
Surprised by her warm lips, her hungry, open mouth, Samuel
freezes, then heat spreads through his body, and he thaws. He
kisses her back. Long. Until she stops. They are both
confused by what just happened.
ROMY (CONT’D)
(embarrassed)
I’m so sorry, I shouldn’t have done
that.
SAMUEL
(kind)
It’s ok. It’s fine.
ROMY
It’s not ok. I am so sorry.
SAMUEL
It’s ok-
He smiles. Slowly realizing what she has done, she stares at
him, petrified. She forces a smile on her face and changes
her tone.
ROMY
Great! Ok! Thank you!
He looks at her with warm eyes.
SAMUEL
Thank you.
She leaves.
Pre-lap: A LOUD SCREAM.
NORA
Moooooooooooommmm! Mom!
EXT. UPSTATE HOUSE - DAY
From high in the sky, the camera slowly moves in on the
perfect family (Romy, Jacob, Isabel and Nora). They walk
towards their perfect family home. The lights are on inside,
lit up like a doll’s house.
INT. UPSTATE HOUSE BEDROOM- NIGHT
Romy and Jacob are sleeping. Her phone buzzes. Romy wakes up.
She doesn't recognize the number. She hears a sound. She
looks at Jacob, who is still sleeping. Anxious, she gets out
of bed. She walks up to the window.
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 27.
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 28.
To her surprise, she sees Isabel in the pool with A GIRL
(OPHELIA, 17). Steam comes off of the heated water. It’s a
magical image. They kiss. Romy wants to go downstairs but
instead she just watches, entranced. She looks back at her
phone.
IN. UPSTATE HOUSE BEDROOM- EARLY MORNING
The family sleeps together in a huge bed. Nora cuddles a
teddy bear. Peaceful. Isabel, at the foot of the bed, in her
bathing suit and pajama pants.
EXT. UPSTATE HOUSE SWIMMING POOL- DAY
With a net Romy tries to fish a small dead skunk out of the
pool. Isabel comes to help her, trying to connect to Romy.
They manage to hoist the dead animal onto the edge.
ROMY
Do you like the girl from next
door? How old is she, 17?
Surprised Isabel looks up.
ISABEL
(blushing)
What do you mean?
ROMY
I thought you were in love with-
Mary?
Isabel studies her face. She notices her mother’s
vulnerability.
ISABEL
(patiently explaining)
I am in love with Mary -I’m just
having fun with Ophelia.
Romy looks at her daughter, a bit confused.
INT. OFFICE BUILDING MEETING ROOM/ BULLPEN -DAY
Full screen: a video on proper conduct in the workplace.
Samuel and some other interns make notes. Through the glass
wall, he sees Romy speaking to her team next to a big monitor
that plays a video of the warehouses. Esme stands next to
her. Romy seems angry. He studies her dominant body language
and facial expressions. He watches her as she puts on her
coat and leaves. Samuel gets up.
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 28.
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 29.
INT./ EXT. OFFICE BUILDING LOBBY TO PLAZA- DAY
Romy walks out of the office, Samuel comes running after her.
SAMUEL
(polite)
Hey! Wait! Sorry- Can I ask you
something?
Romy keeps walking.
SAMUEL (CONT’D)
Why didn’t you respond?
ROMY
To what?
She increases her speed but he keeps walking next to her.
Christmas lights everywhere.
SAMUEL
They said we are supposed to meet
weekly, but you didn't answer the
email. They sent an email.
ROMY
I have to go- I have an
appointment.
He stands in front of her. Nervous, she looks around to see
if anyone is watching them.
SAMUEL
(patiently explaining)
It’s very easy. The email has a
link. You just click on a date and
a time for the second appointment-
It will pop up in your calendar-
ROMY
I have to go.
But she doesn’t move. He tilts his head, he takes a step
towards her. He shifts his tone.
SAMUEL
Listen, if you don’t want to be my
mentor, I totally understand.
(he smiles)
I’ll ask someone else, but I do
want one. They say it makes a huge
difference. There’s lots of other
people I can ask, so-
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 29.
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 30.
ROMY
Are you done?
SAMUEL
With?
She brings her face close to his.
ROMY
(whispers)
Do you understand that your
behavior is totally out of line?
SAMUEL
Is it?
Their bodies are close, she looks at him. They take each
other in. She can smell him. The tension is building, their
faces are just inches apart. She wants to leave but she can’t
bring herself to walk away from him.
SAMUEL (CONT’D)
We are supposed to meet once a
week, that’s how it works. I didn’t
make the rules.
People are walking past them. With big eyes she looks at him.
She smiles.
ROMY
Ok. Yes. I’ll think about it.
She turns around and walks away. Her cheeks are red. The
streets of New York are busy. The loud sounds of the city
overwhelm her. Her head is spinning. She looks up.
PRE-LAB:
BANG! BANG!
INT. THEATER- DAY
BANG! Loud shots are fired straight at the camera.
HEDDA (SCARLETT)
(loud, with joy)
This is what comes of sneaking in
by the back-way!
HEDDA (SCARLETT, 32) holds a pistol and fires again.
BRACK (STEPHEN)
Are you out of your senses?
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 30.
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 31.
From behind the audience seats, judge BRACK is making his way
to the stage. Romy walks in, trying to be invisible. For a
moment Scarlett (Hedda) looks at Romy. Behind Scarlett we see
on a huge video wall, Scarlett's face.
HEDDA
(laughing)
Dear me, did I happen to hit you?
Brack climbs onto the stage, and aggressively takes the
pistol from her hand. Before she can speak, he points it at
her forehead. Scarlett leans into the gun. Romy stands in the
back. She holds her breath. She sees herself in Hedda.
BRACK
I wish you would leave these pranks
alone.
Quietly, Romy takes a seat behind her husband who is
rehearsing. Next to him two assistants and their laptops.
Surprised, and a bit taken aback, Jacob turns around.
JACOB
(whispers)
What are you doing here?
BRACK
You’re not really happy. That’s the
bottom of it.
On stage, the actors stop.
SCARLETT
(To Stephen. Not realizing
her mic is still on)
What’s going on?
The mics are muted.
ROMY
(whispers to Jacob)
Watching you in your natural
habitat.
JACOB
The last time you did that was in
1997 when you thought I was having
an affair with a light technician.
Romy laughs. He looks at her red cheeks.
JACOB (CONT’D)
You don’t have to be at work?
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 31.
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 32.
She smiles. Jacob gets up to give directions. Romy briefly
grabs his hand. She looks at him full of admiration, before
he runs towards the stage. Fascinated, Romy watches Jacob.
Seeing him work reminds her how much she loves him.
INT. LUXURIOUS BAR MIDTOWN- NIGHT
A bar filled with loud business men in suits. Romy walks in
with Hazel, Tom and Robert. They pass a group of interns and
young employees. Samuel looks at Romy as she walks by. Romy
ignores him. Surprised to see Romy entering the bar, Esme
jumps up. The young people around Esme start to whisper in
each others ears when they notice Romy. Romy and her team
take a seat at a table in the back. Esme comes over.
ESME
(A bit tipsy)
You finally came! We’ve been
begging her to get a drink with us
for over a year!
Everyone laughs. Esme sits down next to Hazel.
ESME (CONT’D)
You know what we should focus on
way more? Recruiting women.
Especially young female engineers-
HAZEL
Oh, trust me, we are.
Samuel watches Romy from the bar.
ESME
I know, but wouldn't it be cool to
offer, like, a special support
program within the company for
young female employees? So they can
find their way to the top easier?
ROMY
(to Hazel)
Listen to her!
HAZEL
We would love to sit down and
discuss that with you.
ESME
You would?
Proud, Esme looks at Romy. Charmed by Esme’s drunken
enthusiasm, Romy smiles at her.
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 32.
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 33.
ROMY
(to Esme)
See?
Robert walks over with a tray full of drinks. Esme gets up.
From a distance Romy watches Samuel, he is telling a joke,
dancing strangely. When Esme rejoins them, she stands close
to him and touches his arm. Briefly Samuel’s hand rests on
Esme’s back. A wave of jealousy rushes through Romy’s body.
Suddenly, the waiter puts a glass of milk down in front of
Romy, snapping her out of her haze. The men and women at her
table laugh and look around, to see who ordered it, but it’s
unclear.
ROMY (CONT’D)
Did you order this?
TOM
No...
Romy makes eye contact with Samuel, who watches her from the
bar. She reaches for the glass.
HAZEL
(whispers)
Are you gonna drink that? Don’t
drink that-
Slowly, Romy drinks the entire glass of milk while making eye
contact with Samuel. Some business men behind her start
laughing.
INT. LUXURIOUS BAR MIDTOWN- NIGHT
LATER- The bar is totally empty. Romy pays the bill. The
group of interns, including Esme, have left. Suddenly Samuel
walks out of the men’s room. He doesn’t look at Romy but when
he walks past her he whispers in her ear.
SAMUEL
Good girl.
Romy freezes. He keeps on walking to the exit.
INT. OFFICE BUILDING ROMY'S OFFICE- NIGHT
Romy is running late. Laying on the floor, she tries to get
into a huge, beautiful blue dress. She squirms like a snake
shedding its skin. We hear the final scene of Jacob’s Hedda
Gabler.
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 33.
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 34.
HEDDA O.S.
(scared)
And what will I do in the evenings?
TESMAN O.S.
Oh I’m sure judge Brack will be
more than happy to keep you
company.
BRACK O.S.
Absolutely dear Hedda! We will have
a ball!
HEDDA O.S.
(emotional)
Oh yes you would love that,
wouldn't you judge Brack?
(screams)
To be the only cock in my run?
A loud shot is fired. Hedda kills herself. A scream.
BRACK O.S.
Who does such a thing?
Applause.
CUT TO:
INT. THEATRE- OPENING NIGHT
The curtains are closed. The last few people walk out. An
usher picks up playbills. Romy sits alone in her dress,
staring at the empty stage. She looks around, unsure where
to go.
INT. THEATRE BACKSTAGE STAIRCASE/HALLWAY- NIGHT
Romy walks down a staircase, looking for the dressing room.
An actor with a wig in her hand runs by her, laughing.
INT. THEATRE SCARLETT’S DRESSING ROOM- NIGHT
People are crammed in the small dressing room. Romy walks in.
Everyone is drinking, sweating and raving about the show.
Adrenaline is high. Her phone buzzes. An older actor, Stephen
(the actor who plays BRACK) is imitating a robot. “Bleep,
bleep!” Romy observes Jacob.
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 34.
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 35.
His almost childlike, happy face makes her smile. Stephen
embraces Romy. Her phone keeps buzzing.
ROMY
(to Stephen)
You were wonderful!
Distracted, Romy looks at her phone.
STEPHEN
Do you have phone addiction? It’s a
serious issue-
She looks straight into his eyes.
ROMY
No, Stephen, I have a job.
She takes his glass of champagne and finishes it.
STEPHEN
I thought you didn’t drink-
She walks over to Jacob who is talking to Scarlett.
ROMY
(genuine)
It was wonderful, just wonderful!
(to Scarlett)
You were amazing- you made me cry.
(whispers in his ear)
I have to go. Work emergency.
He grabs her.
JACOB
No. ROMY (CONT’D)
Sorry.
JACOB (CONT’D)
(whispers in her ear)
It’s the one night I need you by my
side.
ROMY
I know. I’m so sorry. It’s
just there is so much
pressure now-
JACOB (CONT’D)
Come on. You can’t go.
Curious, Scarlett looks at Romy.
SCARLETT
How are you?
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 35.
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 36.
ROMY
I’m sorry. I have to go-
Other people start to notice the tension between the couple.
Romy starts to leave, Jacob follows her into the tiny
hallway. He grabs her arm.
JACOB
Romy!
ROMY
(sweet)
I really have to go. So sorry. Have
fun. It was wonderful!
She manages to escape.
INT. OFFICE EXECUTIVE FLOOR HALLWAYS -NIGHT
Cautiously, Romy walks down the hallway in her dress, not
sure what to expect.
INT. OFFICE BUILDING ROMY'S OFFICE -NIGHT
Embarrassed, Romy falls into her chair. On her desk she finds
a note. It has a date, time, and address written on it.
EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - NIGHT
From the street, Samuel looks up at Romy’s office windows.
Watching her. He smokes a cigarette.
EXT. 27TH STREET- DUSK
Tense, Romy walks down the street in a designer coat. It’s
cold.
INT. CHEAP HOTEL ROOM- NIGHT
Romy enters the worn out room. She looks around. The walls
are painted red. She notices a stain on the carpet.
ROMY
Hello?
She takes her coat off. In a beautiful, expensive outfit, she
sits down on the edge of the bed. She isn’t used to waiting
for anything. She finds a long, dark hair on the bed. She
picks it up and studies it.
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 36.
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 37.
She takes a cheap piece of strawberry candy wrapped in red
paper out of a bowl. Samuel enters with a small plastic bag
from a bodega.
SAMUEL
(indifferent)
Oh. You’re here.
He is wearing a hoody and jeans, the hood over his head. He
doesn’t look at her. Slowly, he takes some items out of the
bag. Nervous, she watches him. Tension builds between them.
ROMY
Sit down.
He immediately does.
ROMY (CONT’D)
Your behavior is unacceptable.
SAMUEL
(he smiles)
What behavior?
ROMY
(convincing herself)
That’s all I have to say and that’s
the only reason I’m here-
SAMUEL
What are you talking about?
He laughs. Amused by her anger.
ROMY
-to stop this and your wild
behavior.
SAMUEL
What does that mean?
ROMY
Leaving me notes? Calling me?
Sending me milk?
SAMUEL
(smiles)
Well- you drank it all...
ROMY
Texting me? Inviting me to this
ridiculous hotel? Keeping me
waiting- Are you fucking insane?
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 37.
(MORE)
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 38.
He gets up. While she keeps talking he slowly walks towards
her.
ROMY (CONT’D)
We need to have a very serious
conversation, you and I, we need to
talk this through. Get to the
bottom of it. You need to realize
that what you’re doing is wrong-
He puts his hand on her mouth.
SAMUEL
(soft)
I don’t think I want to talk.
He grabs the back of her head and pushes her face into the
dirty carpet. For a brief moment, he holds her down like a
kitten. Quickly, he lets her go. He scares himself,
struggling to control his impulses. Both of them are lost for
a moment.
SAMUEL (CONT’D)
Sorry but- I’m confused -
You don’t know me. I’m a total-
stranger, but you show up here,
dressed like this- and you want me
to just look at you- and- not do
anything?
Romy is quiet.
SAMUEL (CONT’D)
I’m not some thing you can just
pick up and play with.
ROMY
(annoyed)
Oh, shut the fuck up.
SAMUEL
Get on your knees.
ROMY
(chuckles)
What? No!
He laughs, embarrassed.
SAMUEL
(smiling)
I just feel...Is That what you
want? I don’t know how to- If
that’s what you want - Be honest.
(MORE)
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 38.
SAMUEL (CONT’D)
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 39.
(seriously asking)
Is it?
ROMY
(honest)
I don’t know.
She looks at him. She shifts her tone.
ROMY (CONT’D)
(quietly, genuine)
You’re very young- I don’t want to
hurt you.
SAMUEL
Hurt me? I think I have power over
you, not the other way around. I
mean, one call and you lose
everything. Right?
With an inquiring look he stares at her, curious what she
will say or do.
SAMUEL (CONT’D)
(whispers)
Does that turn you on, when I say
that?
It does but she is too embarrassed to admit it. She sort of
rolls her eyes and shakes her head. He studies her like a
biologist.
SAMUEL (CONT’D)
(whispers, sweetly)
Get on your knees.
For a moment she tries to bend her knees. Then quickly:
ROMY
(decisive)
Ok. I have to go.
She walks to the door, he takes a step towards her. She feels
him behind her. Quickly, she turns around and grabs his face
and kisses him passionately. Gently, he pushes her away.
SAMUEL
(genuine)
No. Not like that. I don’t like it
like that. I don’t want it like
that-
Rejected she attacks him, trying to trigger his aggression.
They land on the floor. They struggle, they wrestle.
SAMUEL (CONT’D)
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 39.
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 40.
She jumps up. He pulls her down and turns her on her belly.
While she crawls away from him he takes her leg. He kisses
her leg, sniffs it, bites it, and slides her body back to
him. She turns towards him, grabs his arm. When she wants to
look at him, he covers her eyes.
SAMUEL (CONT’D)
Don’t.
The more he tells her not to, the harder she keeps trying to
find his gaze. With her fingers she opens his eyes and forces
him to look at her. He laughs.
SAMUEL (CONT’D)
Stop! Stop!
She does. Careful, he takes her hand and pulls her up. They
walk around the small room hand in hand, as if they are two
young lovers, sightseeing on a city trip. He guides her to a
corner of the room, he leaves her there, facing the wall. He
goes to sit on the bed to catch his breath, to think. A long
beat. Calmly, she stands in the corner, waiting.
SAMUEL (CONT’D)
Please take your clothes off-
ROMY
No.
SAMUEL
(soft)
Why not?
ROMY
(scared to show her body
to such a young man)
I don’t know. I don’t want to.
SAMUEL
(kind)
Ok. That’s ok.
With his hand he gestures for her to come sit next to him on
the bed. She does. For a short moment she lays her head on
his shoulder.
SAMUEL (CONT’D)
Would you mind getting on your
hands and knees for me?
ROMY
Why?
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 40.
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 41.
He breathes in, trying to calm himself, understand himself,
and to slow down. He takes a piece of candy out of the bowl.
SAMUEL
(smiling)
Could you maybe try? For the sake
of what we’re trying to...do here?
She shakes her head. He waits. He observes her, trying to
measure her response. Slowly she gets up and bends her knees.
First, she kneels in front of him. She looks at him with
questioning eyes. She places both her hands in front of her,
on the carpet. When she is on all fours, he holds out his
hand. He makes soft, sweet sounds with his mouth as if
calling a puppy. Hesitant, she crawls towards him. Ashamed,
she eats the candy from his hand. While she chews, he strokes
her head. He goes to sit next to her on the floor. He lays
her flat on her belly. Gently, he caresses her. His hand
slides under her skirt. He starts to pleasure her. She lets
it happen. After a while she feels like it’s taking too long
and tries to get up.
SAMUEL (CONT’D)
(kind)
No- no. It’s ok-
He gently holds her down. She closes her eyes. She tries to
surrender. He takes his time. She starts to shake a little
bit.
ROMY
(whispers, embarrassed)
I’m gonna...I don’t wanna pee-
He keeps going. Torn between guilt and joy, she breathes in,.70 70
He feels her very slowly reaching her climax. Her whole body
starts to shake. She orgasms for real. An unfamiliar sound
escapes her. More growling than moaning. This has never
happened to her before. Overwhelmed by her reaction to his
touch, he holds her. A wave of emotion washes over her.
Embarrassed, she tries to hold back her tears. Calmly, he
looks at her vulnerable eyes. Protective, he holds her in his
arms. She lets go and cries.
INXS, Never Tear Us Apart, starts play to quietly.
Later- They sit next to each other on the edge of the bed.
Samuel is shirtless, Romy wears Samuel’s hoodie. He reaches
over, and zips up the sweater, then puts the hood over her
head.

- EXT. ALLEYWAY: Samuel turns Romy around, presses her face
up against the wall. He covers her eyes and starts to have
sex with her from behind.
- INT. OFFICE KITCHEN: Samuel enters. Romy sees him in the
reflection of the window. He comes up behind her, and takes a
coffee cup form the shelf. To her surprise, he lets it slide
out of his hands. The cup breaks into pieces on the floor. He
looks at the shards and at her.
SAMUEL
(calm)
Why don’t you clean that up?
Slowly, Romy gets down on her hands and knees. Carefully she
gathers the pieces in her hand. She focusses on the task,
trying to execute it precisely. With his foot he kicks some
of the shards towards her. She lays her head on his shoe.
- EXT. ALLEYWAY: Romy and Samuel kiss, post-coital. Romy
caresses Samuel’s face. She looks at him with soft, loving
eyes. Grateful. We see the lights of the city.
INT. UPSTATE HOUSE- KITCHEN- NIGHT
Full of new found energy Romy prepares a meal. A fire
crackles, a beautifully decorated Christmas tree, classical
music is playing. Perfect happiness. The family is gathered
for a cozy dinner. Isabel’s girlfriend, Mary, is at the table
too. Romy is on top of the world. She is dancing. Jacob
enjoys his wife’s mood.
ISABEL
(laughing)
Mom! Stop.
Nora joins her mother and starts to make wild dance moves.
Romy goes out of her way to show Mary a good time. Jacob
quietly observes his cheerful wife and daughter interacting.
INT. UPSTATE HOUSE- BEDROOM- NIGHT
In the bedroom Romy and Jacob, sit under the bed sheet like
two children. They speak in hushed voices about their
daughter and her girlfriend. The tone is playful and happy.
ROMY
Did you notice how Isabel set the
table, and helped with everything?
She never does that.

White Production Draft (10/31/23) 44.
JACOB
They seem so happy together, it’s
wonderful. And Mary...I think she’s
a great girl.
Romy laughs, Jacob studies her face.
INT. UPSTATE HOUSE KITCHEN- NIGHT
Isabel sits on the kitchen counter by the oven, smoking a
cigarette. She blows smoke into the range hood. Quietly, Romy
walks up to her and sits next to her. Without chastising
her, she takes the cigarette and puts it in her own mouth.
Surprised, Isabel smiles. Romy is able to be more intimate
with her daughter now that something has been unlocked inside
of her. She puts her arm around her.
EXT./ INT. UPSTATE HOUSE HALLWAYS/ DINING ROOM-DAY
We follow Romy as she enters the house carrying a fancy
shopping bag. While walking, she takes off her coat in front
of the mirror. She is wearing a revealing new dress, a stark
contrast to her usual work suits. Suddenly she hears Samuel’s
voice. Shocked, she hides behind the open door and listens.
SAMUEL O. S
(about his father)
-he was like working for VIP’s and
political leaders and stuff.
Protecting them. He was a fighter.
Incredibly strong. Incredibly
smart. Later he became a
philosophy teacher. He wrote these
beautiful poems-
When Romy enters the dining room she sees Samuel at the
dining table talking with her family. Tea cups, coffee and
cookies on the table. Jacob is taking in every word Samuel
says. He is inspired by his story. The girls are very charmed
by him. Samuel stops talking when he sees Romy. He holds up
her laptop.
SAMUEL
(enthusiastic)
Hey! You forgot your laptop at the
office! Esme told me to bring it to
you!
Romy hides her panic.

White Production Draft (10/31/23) 45.
SAMUEL (CONT’D)
She said you couldn’t survive a
minute without it.
ROMY
She couldn’t send a messenger?
SAMUEL
(smiling)
I thought- better in person- in
case... Sensitive information... I
took the train.
JACOB
Is that a new dress? You look hot!
ISABEL
Dad! Eeeww-
JACOB
What?
NORA
(to Samuel)
Do you work with the robots?
SAMUEL
No, not directly! I’m only an
intern, so I have to work very hard
to prove myself first!
ISABEL
Do they pay you?
SAMUEL
Yes. Of course. And I work at a
bar.
ISABEL
What bar?
SAMUEL
The Nines.
NORA
I am named after a play.
SAMUEL
What? A play? Which one?
NORA
I’m a dancer. You want to see me
dance the Tarantella?
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 45.
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 46.
SAMUEL
Yes!
Nora starts to dance.
ROMY
(cold)
We have to go soon.
Quickly, Samuel gets up.
SAMUEL
(blushing)
Oh! I’m so sorry. Yes. Of course!
Embarrassed, he smiles. Jacob puts his hand on his arm.
JACOB
Do you want some more coffee?
Unsure of himself, Samuel looks at Romy. Is he allowed to
stay?
SAMUEL
(to Nora)
You’re a great dancer.
ISABEL
You want to come to come on a hike
with us?
Samuel looks at Romy, who tries to hide her panic.
EXT. UPSTATE FOREST BEHIND THEIR HOUSE-DAY
The family are on a hike. Samuel watches as the children run
up behind Jacob and jump on his back, yelling and laughing.
They play wrestle – Samuel reaches out his hand to join in.
From in the distance Romy, looks down at them all having a
good time.
INT. /EXT. UPSTATE CAR/ PARKING LOT TRAIN STATION- LATE
AFTERNOON
The car is parked. Romy and Samuel sit in silence.
SAMUEL
They’re so nice- You’re family-
That’s what I want, for myself.
Later.
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 46.
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 47.
Romy turns towards him. Her eyes are dark.
ROMY
Don’t ever show up like that again.
SAMUEL
What? I was just- doing my job.
ROMY
(calm but threatening)
My family is everything to me.
Don’t you ever do that again.
SAMUEL
What are you talking about?
Hurt, he wants to get out of the car but the door is locked.
He tries again. She doesn't open it.
SAMUEL (CONT’D)
Let me out!
ROMY
Listen. SAMUEL (CONT’D)
Jesus Christ. Open the door.
ROMY (CONT’D)
Wait.
Realizing she has to manage the situation, she tries to calm
him down. She touches his arm. Even though he is angry and
hurt, her touch relaxes him.
ROMY (CONT’D)
I’m sorry. Lets calm down and talk
for a moment. I was just- I didn't
expect you to show up at my house!
She puts his hand on his leg. She looks at him with soft
eyes.
ROMY (CONT’D)
I don’t think- We can see each
other outside of work anymore-
SAMUEL
(with controlled anger)
Take your hand of my leg.
Quickly she takes it away.
ROMY
Sorry.
A beat. They both think about it. He turns towards her.
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 47.
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 48.
SAMUEL
Romy, I don't want a girlfriend, if
that’s what you’re afraid off. You
look like a... mother. I’m not-
I’m not interested in that.
She looks at him. He tries to explain how he sees it:
SAMUEL (CONT’D)
I thought what we were doing- It’s
like- In my mind- We’re like--two
children. Playing. It’s natural.
ROMY
(quickly)
You’re not a child.
SAMUEL
Whatever.
He tries to open the door.
SAMUEL (CONT’D)
(calm)
Unlock the car. Unlock the car! Or
do you want to keep me here?
She doesn’t open the door. He raises his voice.
SAMUEL (CONT’D)
(aggressive)
Unlock the fucking car!!
(emotional)
Why are you making me like this? I
don’t want to feel like this!
Worried, she grabs his arm.
ROMY
Hey!! Listen! This stops here,
whatever this is. I’m sorry if it
is confusing for you. It’s
confusing for me too- for the both
of us.
She looks at his face, his skin.
ROMY (CONT’D)
You’re very... young.
SAMUEL
No- I’m not-
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 48.
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 49.
ROMY
You are-
(she pauses)
I’m not going to...fire you but we
have to keep it- professional.
SAMUEL
What the fuck does that mean?
ROMY
I’m just trying to take care of you
here.
SAMUEL
You’re taking care of me?
(he shakes his head)
No.
They lock eyes. They know they are in dangerous territory.
She unlocks the car. He gets out. She looks at him walking
away. She drives off.
INT. AUTOMATED WAREHOUSE- DAY
Overhead shot of a fully automated warehouse. Robots are
moving faster and faster, picking and placing products in
endless amounts of boxes and containers while business radio
is playing louder and louder.
INT. ROMY AND JACOB'S APARTMENT- BATHROOM DAY
Business news continues to play. Close on Romy’s face as she
looks at herself in the mirror. She closes her eyes.
INT. OFFICE BUILDING HALLWAY/ ROMY’S OFFICE- DAY
Romy walks towards her office. Through the glass walls, she
sees Samuel talking to Mr. Missel in her office. Nervous, she
watches them.
INT. OFFICE BUILDING ROMY’S OFFICE-DAY
Romy walks in, Samuel smiles politely at her.
SAMUEL
(to Mr. Missel)
Thank you so much!
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 49.
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 50.
Samuel leaves. Frightened that Samuel spoke to Mr. Missel
about her, she smiles.
ROMY
You were looking for me?
MR. MISSEL
Look at this!
Amused, he shows her the coffee Samuel brought him.
MR. MISSEL (CONT’D)
I didn’t even ask for it! Very
bright kid!
Romy sits down. He looks at her, she forces a smile on her
face.
MR. MISSEL (CONT’D)
I wanted to talk to you about the
tapes Hazel sent over- it’s ok to
relax a little. You don’t need to
be scared of their questions.
ROMY
(submissive)
Yes, yes, I was a little tense I
get that-
Romy gets a text. “ROOF”.
MR MISSEL
(fatherly, warm)
No need, no need, you’ve done it a
million times before-
ROMY
(looking at her phone)
Excuse me- Sebastian-I’m going to
have to take this.
Quickly, she gets up.
EXT. OFFICE BUILDING ROOF DAY
High up, on top of the building, Romy finds Samuel. Smoking a
cigaret, he looks out over the city. It’s snowing. Cautious,
she walks towards him.
ROMY
What’s going on? Are you ok?
Samuel is quiet for a moment. He inhales.
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 50.
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 51.
SAMUEL
Yeah I’m fine- I just eh- I don’t
feel comfortable working for you
anymore.
Worried, Romy stares at him.
SAMUEL (CONT’D)
I’m going to talk to someone and
ask to be transferred to a
different department.
ROMY
(hiding her panic)
You can’t do that- They will ask
questions. They will investigate.
You can’t- You can’t do that- They
could- fire me.
SAMUEL
I thought this was your company.
ROMY
That doesn’t matter.
He takes a step towards her. He tries to suppress his
emotions, his fear, tries to ignore her vulnerable eyes. He
swallows.
SAMUEL
It’s for the best. For both of us.
He walks away. Romy panics.
ROMY
(terrified)
Wait! Samuel! Wait! Wait!
He is gone. For a brief moment Romy looks at the edge of the
roof as if it invites her to come closer.
INT. ROMY AND JACOB'S APARTMENT- BEDROOM- NIGHT
In bed, Romy is glued her phone, waiting for Samuel to call
or text. Sensing her distance, Jacob tries to initiate sex.
He wants to comfort and kiss her, to make love to her.
JACOB
You want to play a little bit?
ROMY
(lying)
Yeah-
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 51.
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 52.
She tries to open up to him, smile, kiss him back, but she
can’t. His touch, his scent, his breath, make her angry.
Aggressively, she rejects him. When he doesn't back off, she
pushes him away. Hard. Hurt, he looks at her.
JACOB
(startled)
Why did you do that?
She studies his face, a flood of mixed emotions. Frustration
builds up inside her.
ROMY
(quietly, emotional)
I’ve never had an orgasm with you-
JACOB
What?
He reaches for her arm.
ROMY
(hisses)
Don’t fucking touch me-
She turns her back to him, tears in her eyes.
ROMY (CONT’D)
I can’t- I can’t come with you.
JACOB
Are you alright? Hey-
ROMY
No-
She gets out of bed, grabs her phone, and walks out.
EXT. STREETS OF NEW YORK- NIGHT
In the middle of the night she walks through the dark streets
of the city. She is wearing Ugg boots. A coat over her
nightgown.
INT. THE NINES BAR- NIGHT.
Cautiously, Romy walks in. Samuel is working behind the quiet
bar. He looks like a prince in his tuxedo. Enthusiastically,
he is telling two beautiful older women a story. Surprised to
see Romy he looks up. When she tries to greet him, he ignores
her. He whispers something in his COLLEAGUE’S(JOSH, 24) ear.
Josh walks up to her.
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 52.
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 53.
JOSH
(whispers)
I think it’s time to leave-
ROMY
(whispers back)
Leave? Why? I need to talk to him.
JOSH
I’m sorry- but he says you need to
leave-
ROMY
(humiliated)
He said that?
JOSH
Yes... Right now.
She looks at Samuel who looks away. Elegantly, Josh helps her
up. He escorts Romy to the door. Before she exits, Samuel
looks at her.
INT. ROMY AND JACOB'S APARTMENT- KITCHEN DAY
In the early morning, Romy and Jacob stand in the kitchen. A
tense silence between them. Jacob is on his way out but
lingers.
JACOB
Did you order the headphones for
Isabel’s birthday?
She nods. She stares at the gifts. He is waiting for her to
start talking. She doesn’t.
JACOB (CONT’D)
(with controlled
frustration)
Did you- Did you mean what you
said? About never-
ROMY
(emotional)
I was just taking it out on you- Of
course I didn't mean it. That would
be- Nineteen years of- I mean; no,
I was angry. I was stressed. Of
course I didn't mean it- I am
sorry.
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 53.
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 54.
JACOB
(vulnerable)
I- I’ve never- Normally, you know-
Women- you know, they-
ROMY
I’m not normal. I’m not other
women! Look at me. I’m not normal.
She wants him to comfort her. He stares at her.
JACOB
(to hurt her)
No. You’re not.
He walks out.
INT. OFFICE BUILDING WINDOWLESS BASEMENT ROOM- DAY
Romy sits at the small table. Her hair is messy. Her palms
are sweaty. Anxious, she stares at the door. Her heart is
beating too fast. She lays her hand on her chest to calm
herself down. After a while, Samuel enters. Quickly, she gets
up.
ROMY
Hi-
SAMUEL
I have 7 minutes.
ROMY
Thank you for coming.
He leans against a wall. He remains silent. Her mind is
racing.
ROMY (CONT’D)
(worried)
Did you talk to them already?
He doesn’t respond. She tries to sound calm. In charge.
ROMY (CONT’D)
Ok. So. What can we do to- solve
this? To make you feel better?
SAMUEL
You’re sweating.
Embarrassed, she touches her forehead.
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 54.
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 55.
ROMY
Sorry.
A long beat. He thinks.
SAMUEL
(genuine)
Do you want to lose everything?
ROMY
What?
SAMUEL
You give that impression.
ROMY
What do you mean?
SAMUEL
The way you look at me.
As if you’re expecting me to- do
that. To take it all away.
She shakes her head.
ROMY
No.
SAMUEL
Until you have nothing? Until you
are nothing?
SAMUEL (CONT’D)
Are you using me to do that?
ROMY
(convincing herself)
No, of course not.
SAMUEL
That scares the shit out of me.
ROMY
(firm)
No- I’m not doing that. I promise.
I’m not.
(speaking slowly to
convince him)
I just think cause you’re young and
I’m older than you-
(searching for the right
words)
I want to be protective. I don’t
want to hurt you-
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 55.
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 56.
SAMUEL
You keep saying that- but- I’m
fine. I’m totally fine. I think
you’re the one who’s hurting.
A beat. His words touch her. She feels seen. He shifts his
tone. Her vulnerability softens his heart. He goes to sit
down.
SAMUEL (CONT’D)
(reassuring)
Listen- You don’t have to worry
about it. What we do is- If we
continue to do this-
(fatherly, explaining)
It’s totally normal. I mean... - as
long as it’s... you know-
consensual-
ROMY
(cold)
What does that mean?
SAMUEL
It’s about giving and taking power,
no?
ROMY
(sarcastic)
Come on- What did you do? Go to the
library, looked it up?
SAMUEL
No! I’m just saying- It has nothing
to do with your- family or the
company- It’s between us.
ROMY
I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to- I’m
just nervous.
SAMUEL
You’re nervous? Yeah you look
nervous. You’re all.. You’re acting
all...
He imitates her nervous gestures.
SAMUEL (CONT’D)
(genuine)
Why are you nervous? Why are you so
nervous?
She shrugs, a faint smile in her eyes.
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 56.
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 57.
SAMUEL (CONT’D)
Just to be safe- If we continue to
do this- We need to set some rules-
that you and I both agree on. Like;
I don’t know....
(as if he is making it up
as he goes)
...starting with: I tell you what
to do and- you do it.
He smiles, aware of how that sounds.
ROMY
Oh, come on... Jesus Christ!
Samuel gets up to leave.
SAMUEL
(rejected)
See! This is what I mean- this is
what I’m talking about-
He walks to the door. Worried, Romy tries to stop him from
leaving.
ROMY
I’m sorry, I’m so sorry, No, no,
no, wait come on- Sit down. I’m
sorry- Sit down.
He hesitates.
ROMY (CONT’D)
Please?
He sits back down again. They look at each other. Silence.
Tension builds. He is waiting for her to speak.
SAMUEL
You have to be the one to say it.
That’s how this works.
ROMY
How what works? I don’t-
SAMUEL
This! The dynamic. It’s about
trust!
ROMY
(half smiling)
I thought you said it had to be
consensual.
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 57.
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 58.
He can’t help but laugh.
SAMUEL
Yes, that’s what consent is Romy!
That’s what it is. You have to
agree to it. Both parties have to
agree to it.
ROMY
And if I don’t?
SAMUEL
Then I will have to go talk to
someone-
ROMY
No, don’t do that. Please?
They look at each other.
SAMUEL
(genuine)
Come on. Just admit that this is
what you want. Be honest.
She exhales, nervous. He studies her.
SAMUEL (CONT’D)
You don’t look comfortable. You
don’t look comfortable at all-
(he pauses)
Why don’t you sit over there?
He points to the table.
SAMUEL (CONT’D)
Sit on the edge, right there-
She stares at him. Slowly, she gets up and walks over to the
edge of the table. She sits down and looks at him unsure of
what he expects her to do. He gets up and pretends to move to
the door.
SAMUEL (CONT’D)
Ok, you need to say it out loud,
otherwise I’m gonna have to go talk
to someone and ask to be
transferred-
ROMY
No, wait wait- SAMUEL (CONT’D)
I’ll go talk to them-
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 58.
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 59.
ROMY (CONT’D)
(as if asking for a line)
What are the words?
SAMUEL
(smiling at her childlike
behavior)
You know the words.
ROMY
I don’t- I- don’t.
SAMUEL
(a little exasperated)
You do. Just say it.
ROMY
Ok, ok--I’ll say it.
He steps towards her, places his hand on her thigh. She
inhales deeply. He whispers into her ear:
SAMUEL
I need to hear you say...
He slides his hand under her skirt. She can’t help but moan.
SAMUEL (CONT’D)
You can do it.
ROMY
(whispering)
What do you want me to say?
SAMUEL
(slowly)
I... will... do...
ROMY
I will do-
She feels his fingers between her legs.
SAMUEL
Whatever you tell me to do.
ROMY
Whatever you tell me to do.
His scent makes her brain melt. She starts to breath heavily.
ROMY (CONT’D)
I will do whatever you tell me to
do.
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 59.
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 60.
SAMUEL
Say it again.
She looks up at him like a child.
ROMY
I will do whatever you tell me to
do.
SAMUEL
Good.
Quickly, he pulls his hand out from her skirt, and walks out
the room. Leaving her on edge. Her eyes go dark. She is
panting.
INT. LUXURIOUS HOTEL ROOM DAY
The presidential suite. A long hallway with doors leading to
the many different beautiful, luxurious rooms. Romy stands in
front of a golden mirror and checks her reflection. A knock
on the door. She starts walking towards it.
INT. LUXURIOUS HOTEL- SUITE- DAY
1. Nervous, Romy opens the door. They both smile. He walks
past her.
SAMUEL
(childlike)
Hey! There’s a whole living room in
here!
2. Cut to: Silence. Totally different atmosphere. Romy sits
on a sofa in the living room. He sits opposite her. She wants
to get up and kiss him.
SAMUEL (CONT’D)
Stay.
She sits down. He stares at her.
ROMY
Don’t stare at me.
SAMUEL
Why?
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 60.
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 61.
ROMY
I don’t like to be looked at.
SAMUEL
Ok. (he looks away)
I understand that.
(a beat)
Go make yourself a drink.
ROMY
I don’t- (drink).
She stops herself. Gets up, and takes one of the small
bottles of liquor. She sits down again. She takes a small
sip.
SAMUEL
All of it.
ROMY
No.
SAMUEL
(smiling)
Don’t say no.
She drinks.
SAMUEL (CONT’D)
Take your panties off.
She looks at her hands.
ROMY
You take them off.
SAMUEL
(calmly smiling)
Don’t tell me what to do.
She takes them off.
SAMUEL (CONT’D)
Open your legs.
She does. A tiny bit. He looks at her.
SAMUEL (CONT’D)
How does that make you feel?
ROMY
Scared.
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 61.
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 62.
SAMUEL
Ok. (he pauses)
You want to take your dress off for
me now? So I can see you?
She shakes her head.
SAMUEL (CONT’D)
But you’re going to do it anyway?
She pauses, thinks about it for a moment and nods.
SAMUEL (CONT’D)
-can’t hear you-
ROMY
Yes.
SAMUEL
Yes what?
ROMY
Yes, I will take my dress off.
SAMUEL
Ok.
She gets up. She turns around and starts to unzip the dress.
When it falls to the floor, she takes her bra off, still with
her back to him. Slowly, unsure of herself, she turns towards
him. With her hands she tries to cover herself. He studies
her body, taking his time to admire it. She blushes.
SAMUEL (CONT’D)
You’re beautiful.
Embarrassed, she looks away. Standing in front of him like
this makes her feel small. She can’t help but get emotional.
ROMY
(soft)
No...
SAMUEL
(gentle)
You are.
She shakes her head. Tears in her eyes. All she feels is self
hate. He gets up and gently kisses her, still fully clothed.
She is completely naked, vulnerable. He takes her in his
strong arms. She relaxes.
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 62.
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 63.
SAMUEL (CONT’D)
You’re so beautiful.
She breathes out.
SAMUEL (CONT’D)
(whispering, almost
inaudible in her ear)
You’re my babygirl.
Slowly, he guides her down to her knees. She looks up.
SAMUEL (CONT’D)
Go ahead.
She unbuckles his belt. Father Figure by George Michael
starts to play.
CUT TO:
3. While we continue to hear Father Figure over the rest of
the scene, Samuel, a whiskey in his hand, dances shirtless.
Across the room, Romy sits in an arm chair watching him, legs
crossed in front of her, dressed in a white robe. He dances
for her.
4. Cut to: Close on Romy’s lips. He sticks his fingers in her
mouth. She sucks on them. He moves them in and out of her
mouth. They kiss.
5. He dances, she touches his chest. He takes her hand and
pulls her close. They slow dance together.
6. Cut to: They sit in the window, very close.
SAMUEL (CONT’D)
What’s the safe word?
ROMY
What?
SAMUEL
Don’t we need a safe word?
She nods.
ROMY
(shy)
Eh- Jacob?
SAMUEL
(smiling)
You’re husbands name?

White Production Draft (10/31/23) 64.
She nods.
SAMUEL (CONT’D)
(kind)
Ok.
Cut to:
7. They sit on chairs next to each other. A tray filled with
cakes and tea between them. He takes a jug of milk and pours
some of it into a saucer. He puts it on the floor, between
his legs. Patiently, he waits for her to understand what she
is supposed to do. She gets down on her hands and knees and
crawls to the saucer. When she starts to drink from the milk
like a kitten, he gently pulls her hair back. When the saucer
is empty, she looks at him, milk dripping off her chin. He
kisses her cheeks, her lips. Licks the milk off of her face
and lips. They kiss.
8. He carries her in his arms like a baby and moves to the
music (still Father Figure).
9. Samuel’s hand around Romy’s throat. He dances with her
from behind. As he squeezes her neck, she leans back into his
body.
10. In the bedroom they have sex. Romy straddles Samuel as
they make love. Father Figure ends.
11. They lay under the white sheets, in bed, happily
exhausted. Their faces very close together, they look into
each others eyes and whisper.
SAMUEL (CONT’D)
Can you do your therapy on me?
ROMY
(laughing)
No.
SAMUEL
Cause you’re afraid of what might
come out of me?
ROMY
No, because I’m not a therapist.
SAMUEL
(genuine question)
Do you think I’m a - bad...person?
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 64.
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 65.
ROMY
No. You’re a lovely person. You
sense things- You know things- what
people want- what they need-
SAMUEL
I scare myself. Sometimes.
She moves closer to him.
ROMY
You don’t scare me.
She thinks for a moment.
ROMY (CONT’D)
What star sign are you?
He laughs.
SAMUEL
I don’t believe in that shit.
(a beat, he looks into her
eyes, and then
vulnerable:)
Can you hold me?
She does.
INT. JACOB AND ROMY’S APARTMENT LIVING ROOM-DAY
Overhead shot of Nora spinning in her red dress. Loud music
is playing. She is dancing the tarantella. Nora dances
wildly. Beautiful. Animalistic. Out of control. Romy sits on
the sofa and stares at her daughter.
INT. EMDR CLINIC/ UNDEFINED SPACE
Romy with headphones and wrist bands on. Her eyes move from
left to right, following the light bar. The therapist counts
out loud. Flashback to Romy’s childhood: kids covered in
paint are dancing, screaming-
CUT TO:
INT. ROMY AND JACOB'S APARTMENT- LIVING ROOM- DAY
Teenagers dancing just as wild as Romy did when she was a
child. Isabel is turning 16.

White Production Draft (10/31/23) 66.
Isabel’s friends are having fun, among them, Mary. Romy
watches them. When the doorbell rings, Romy rushes to the
door. She opens the door and is shocked to see Samuel and
Esme smiling at her. Esme has a big present in her hands.
ESME
Hi!
SAMUEL
Hi!
ROMY
(smiling)
Come in!
Hiding her panic, Romy guides them to the living room.
ESME
(quiet in her ear, re
Samuel)
You don’t mind, do you?
ROMY
(smiling)
No, of course not.
Esme and Samuel greet Isabel.
INT. ROMY AND JACOBS APARTMENT LIVING ROOM-DAY
Worried, Romy observes Samuel who is talking to Jacob. Esme
is dancing with Isabel and Mary. She takes out her phone and
types. She watches Samuel take out his phone.
INT. ROMY AND JACOB'S APARTMENT- KITCHEN- DAY
Romy is doing the dishes. Samuel enters.
ROMY
(whispers)
What are you doing?
SAMUEL
What do you mean?
ROMY
Why are you here?
(she tries to understand)
With her?
SAMUEL
We see each other.
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 66.
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 67.
ROMY
What does that mean?
SAMUEL
What did you want me to say to her?
‘No I can’t come with you because-’
ROMY
Are you dating her?
SAMUEL
Isn’t that man in the living room
your husband?
Romy takes a step towards him. With her forehead she touches
his, as if she’s going to head-butt him. It’s intimidating.
He pushes back.
ROMY
(whispers)
I don’t want you to see other
women. You’re mine-
Fueled by jealousy she can’t control herself. Suddenly, they
hear someone coming. When Esme appears in the doorway, Romy
drops a glass. Samuel immediately kneels and starts to pick
up the shards. Uneasy, Esme stares at them.
ESME
Everything ok?
SAMUEL
I was just asking if I could help
with anything...
ROMY
(to Samuel)
Yes! (gesturing to the broken
glass)
Please, can you clean that up?
Esme isn’t sure what is going on. She forces a smile on her
face.
ESME
It’s a lovely party.
INT. OFFICE BUILDING ROMY'S OFFICE- DAY
Romy stands at the window, she looks down on the city. Esme
knocks on the door.

ROMY
Come in.
ESME
You wanted to see me?
ROMY
Yes! Hi! Sit down.
Romy’s eyes are soft, her tone friendly.
ROMY (CONT’D)
How are you?
ESME
Well. Thank you. You?
ROMY
How is Samuel?
ESME
(shy)
What? I thought we were going to
talk about-
ROMY
(friendly)
I just wanted to make sure
everything is ok, since we’re
supposed to discuss your future
soon-
ESME
Yes. I know. I mean, that’s what I-
Romy lowers her voice.
ROMY
You have to be careful, Esme, he’s
an intern.
Romy stops herself. With big eyes, Esme looks at her.
ROMY (CONT’D)
I don’t want to sound dramatic, but
you’re in a position of power over
him.
Esme stares at Romy, with a mixture of suspicion and worry.

ESME
(trying to find the right
words)
Oh- Ehh- we’ve just been hanging
out- (fast)
As friends. We’re not-
ROMY
You can tell me anything. You know
that, right?
ESME
I didn’t think it would be a big
deal to bring him- but you’re
right. I am so sorry-
ROMY
I just want to protect you.
Romy’s phone buzzes. Close on the screen: It’s Samuel. Like a
junky she grabs the phone.
ROMY (CONT’D)
Sorry, one moment-
Quickly, Romy walks out.
SAMUEL
(on the phone)
I want to see you tonight
Loud House music starts playing.
EXT./ INT. CITY STREETS/ HIGHWAY- UBER BLACK CAR NIGHT
Romy looks out of the window while the car drives out of the
city. She watches the Christmas decorations transition into
the highway. As the car drives through a deserted area, Romy
speaks to Jacob on the phone. The house music continues to
play. The lyrics of the song seem to be in dialogue with
Romy’s voice.
ROMY
I have to stay late tonight...don’t
Wait up...
Yeah I know- Sorry- Don’t wait
for me... Oh and don’t forget
Isabel has soccer tomorrow early
morning- And Nora has dance- Yeah,
I’ll wake her up... OK... I’ll just
sneak in... Love you.

EXT. WAREHOUSE RAVE- NIGHT
The Uber drops Romy in the abandoned parking lot. Hesitant
she gets out of the car.The music is loud and fast. Young
people are smoking cigarettes outside. A boy stares at her.
For a moment, Romy wants to turn around but the car is gone.
She decides to go inside.
INT. WAREHOUSE RAVE - NIGHT
Romy walks through an L shaped tunnel. She passes some young
people laughing. She enters a very narrow dark stone
corridor. A young man on drugs sticks his tongue out. Trying
to find her way to the dance floor. She looks around. Some
people are trying to dance with her. The average age is 23.
She feels completely out of place in every way. Most of the
ravers are shirtless. They move aggressively and violently to
the music. Romy is forced to move with them. The sensation of
warm, sticky bodies against hers and the dancing reminds her
of her childhood. Frightened to fall down and get stepped on,
she tries to hold on to sweaty arms and slippery shoulders.
People try to dance with her but she pushes them away. All
she wants is to find Samuel.
When she finally sees him, he is wildly dancing. His hand on
the skull of the boy he is dancing with and the boy’s hand on
his, a beautiful young girl is dancing close by. When he
notices Romy, he smiles enthusiastically and waves. Romy
tries to get closer to him, but she isn’t able to move, she
is wedged between bodies. Samuel is very close to the
beautiful girl now. Gasping for air, Romy suppresses a panic
attack. Samuel is shouting things at her, but she can’t hear
him, she is drowning in young flesh. Suddenly, two hands grab
her and hold her head up, like a rescue swimmer. The hands
belong to a tall muscular woman, she presses Romy’s body
against hers. Leaning into her, Romy dares to relax a little.
The woman kisses her, Romy kisses her back for a brief
moment. Someone lets her drink from a bottle of water. Slowly
they start to dance. Others join. Faster and faster they
move. Samuel makes his way to the group and joins them.
Samuel’s wet, naked upper body is pushed against Romy’s.
Happy, Romy wraps her arms around him. The weird, staccato
movements of the Gabber dance, make Romy laugh. Someone tries
to take Romy’s jacket off, she lets it happen. Samuel is
close to her. Surprised by her risky behavior in public, he
observes her. The bodies that seemed to want to crush her
moments before, now give her comfort and a sense of
belonging. As long as she is with him, glued to him, she can
breath. She dances as if her life depends on it. Only for
him, she is wild and free. Suddenly he grabs her hand and
starts to make his way out of the crowd.

INT. WAREHOUSE LABYRINTH STAIRCASES/ HALLWAYS- NIGHT
Samuel drags Romy through a labyrinth of hallways. He has her
hand firmly in his, she almost trips. Both their pupils are
big.
INT. WAREHOUSE SMALL ABANDONED ROOM - NIGHT
He leads her into a small worn out space. He sits on the
floor and pulls her down too. We hear the house music in the
distance. He lights a joint.
SAMUEL
You know that a cuckoo bird lays
eggs in the nest of other birds?
ROMY
(laughing)
What?
SAMUEL
The cuckoo chicks basically grow up
in the wrong nest and create chaos-
ROMY
You’re not a bird.
SAMUEL
(laughing)
I am.
He looks at her. She brings her face close to his. She
whispers in his ear.
ROMY
(shy, about Esme)
Do you do with her- what you do
with me?
SAMUEL
(genuine, sweet)
She’s not like that Romy. That’s
why I like her in a different way.
That’s why I like myself in a
different way, with her.
Her heart hurts. Her eyes tear up. He touches her forehead
with his. He kisses her softly, tenderly. She smiles.

INT. ROMY AND JACOB'S APARTMENT- KITCHEN- NIGHT
As quiet as she can, Romy walks into the dark living room,
her hair a mess. Startled, Romy stares at Isabel, who sits on
the sofa. Romy looks like a creature from the wild.
ROMY
Oh! You’re still up.
Romy goes and sits down next to Isabel.
ISABEL
(warm)
I’m worried about you-
ROMY
I- am fine. I was very busy- the
past months. It’s done. We
accomplished a lot.
ISABEL
Are you ok?
ROMY
Yes. Are you okay? How is Mary?
ISABEL
(shyly)
She’s good.
Isabel tears up.
ROMY
Bedtime?
Isabel nods.
INT. ROMY AND JACOB'S APARTMENT- KITCHEN DAY
Trying to hide her anxiety, Romy is making pancakes for
breakfast. Classical music playing. Everyone is rushing to
get out of the door on time. Nora in a raincoat and her dance
costume, Isabel, wearing a soccer outfit, keeps a close eye
on her mother, who is trying to keep it together. A knock at
the door, everyone looks up. Romy rushes to answer, but Jacob
is already there.
JACOB
Yes?
ROMY
Who is it?
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 72.
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 73.
JACOB
Esme.
Esme enters, soaking wet from the rain. She stares at the
perfect family, who stares back at her. Jacob starts to push
the kids toward the door, while putting on his rain coat.
INT. ROMY AND JACOB'S APARTMENT-KITCHEN- DAY
Alone, Esme hugs Romy. Long. In her wet coat, Esme sits on
the white, expensive sofa. She looks at the photos on the
wall of Romy and Jacob with famous actors and political
figures. Nervous, Romy stares at her.
ESME
I genuinely thought women with
power would behave differently than
men with power.
ROMY
What makes you say that?
ESME
I tried to speak to you so many
times about my future at the
company.
ROMY
I know. I’m sorry. We can discuss
it now. We all went through- a hard
time, but it paid off. You were
part of that, Esme. Part of the
team who made it happen.
ESME
I don’t want you to make any
promises because you’re afraid of
me.
Confused Romy tries to understand what Esme is trying to say.
ROMY
(genuine)
I’m not afraid of you.
ESME
I know what’s going on between you
and Samuel.
Romy freezes.
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 73.
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 74.
ESME (CONT’D)
I only want what I deserve, not
what is given to me, to silence me.
That’s how it might have worked
when you were young, but luckily,
those days are behind us now.
ROMY
I don’t know what you’re talking
about.
ESME
You will never see Samuel again.
You will be a good leader and you
will create more opportunities for
women within the company, and be a
good example and role model to us
all.
The two woman look at each other. Romy realizes that Esme
might ruin her life and for a brief moment, that thought
seems strangely liberating.
ROMY
You’re confusing ambition with
morality, those are very different
things.
ESME
I have no interest in taking you
down. You are one of the few women
who made it to the top, my interest
is to keep you there. But not like
you are now... As a version of you
that I can look up to and respect.
Tears in Romy’s eyes. Ashamed, she nods her head. Esme
leaves.
INT. ROMY AND JACOB'S APARTMENT- LIVING ROOM- DAY
Later- Romy sits on the sofa in the living room, waiting.
Jacob walks in. She doesn’t dare to look at him. She takes a
sip of water.
JACOB
What’s going on? Are you ok?
Anxious, with his coat still on, he sits down.
ROMY
I need to -
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 74.
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 75.
JACOB
Ok.
A long beat. Her confession comes from very deep within.
ROMY
I- Since I was very little, since I
can remember even, I’ve always had
these specific thoughts-
JACOB
What thoughts?
ROMY
Dark, dark thoughts-
She tries to find the right way to say it.
ROMY (CONT’D)
Thoughts of -- violence. Revolting
thoughts. Embarrassing.
(she has a hard time
saying the words out
loud)
Of being -forced and hurt, and
humiliated-
Worried where she is going, Jacob looks at her.
ROMY (CONT’D)
I was so ashamed- I still am. I
have no idea where they come from,
who planted them in my brain. I
would give anything to erase them,
to delete them-
She forces herself to look at Jacob.
ROMY (CONT’D)
I see myself as a strong, smart
woman, who is...in control of
things, who knows what she’s doing-
Who is loving and caring and
responsible, and who wants to work
on herself. Not some kind of
embarrassing-- masochist, or
ignorant... weak anti feminist who-
JACOB
What are you trying to say? I don’t
understand.
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 75.
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 76.
ROMY
I thought it was all connected to
my childhood- So I tried to work
through that. Every form of therapy-
You know that. But it didn’t help.
It doesn’t help. I was born with
it.
JACOB
What do you mean?
ROMY
And I asked , my first -real
boyfriend, Justin, if he could-
you know- treat me that way, do
something to me- but it disgusted
him- he said. He thought it was
cliche- Which it is!
(she pauses, looks at him)
And with us-
She stops herself. They stare at each other for a beat.
ROMY (CONT’D)
(vulnerable)
I sometimes- tried to- But you
never seem to be... into it.
JACOB
Into what exactly?
She can’t explain.
ROMY
(from deep within)
I just want to be normal. I want to
be normal- I want to be what you
like. I want to be the woman you
like-
JACOB
(kind)
I’m sorry, Romy, I don’t know what
you mean- could you...be a little
more specific-
ROMY
What I’m saying is: I’ve never
experienced any of them. Any of the-
fantasies. In real life, until-
She holds her breath. He holds his.

White Production Draft (10/31/23) 77.
ROMY (CONT’D)
I met-
She summons her courage.
JACOB
Until you met- ?
She stops talking, she freezes. His eyes go dark.
JACOB (CONT’D)
(slow and controlled)
Who? Who did you meet?
She can’t say it.
ROMY
(whispers)
Ehh- I-
JACOB
Jesus. What happened?
She opens her mouth. Nothing comes out. She can’t bring
herself to say his name. He speaks quietly.
JACOB (CONT’D)
What? Say something! Jesus Christ!
Do I know him?
(he feels sick)
Is it- is it Sebastian?
ROMY
What? No. No!
JACOB
Who? ROMY (CONT’D)
No-
JACOB (CONT’D)
What did you do? What?
ROMY
No- it- It was a man- A stranger-
JACOB
A stranger?
Romy flushes red.
ROMY
Somehow- he knew. He sensed-
JACOB
What?
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 77.
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 78.
ROMY
He knew.
JACOB
What? He knew fucking what?
ROMY
How to be- fearless- around me- or-
I mean-
(trying to find words that
wont hurt)
And I couldn’t resist that.
He tries to stay calm.
JACOB
How many times?
ROMY
Once. Only once.
JACOB
Who is this guy? Are you in love
with him?
ROMY
It was as if some sort of animal
woke up inside me.
He stares at her.
ROMY (CONT’D)
(trying to explain
honestly)
For me it’s not about a safe space
and a safe word and consent and
“the kink”- I hate that word.
JACOB
(horrified but calm)
Tell me what happened. Just tell
me.
She thinks. She wants to confess her deepest secrets.
ROMY
(genuine)
It has to be- There has to be a
form of actual danger- Something
needs to be at stake. For real.
(she looks at him)
I know, it’s gross, it’s obscene-
It’s a monster- that will destroy-
anything to get-

JACOB
(trying to understand)
So? What did you do? What did
he do to you?
ROMY (CONT’D)
(firm)
It’s over now. It was like an
exorcism, and it’s done. It’s
out of my system. It happened
once.
ROMY (CONT’D)
(decisive)
I don’t need it anymore. It’s done.
A beat. He looks out of the window, trying to process what is
happening. Anxious, she continues:
ROMY (CONT’D)
My childhood didn't help. The
radical beliefs of my parents. The
communes- the lack of boundaries-
JACOB
(controlled aggression)
Oh! You see yourself as a victim?
Your blaming this on your
childhood?
ROMY
No. Of course not. It’s not that-,
It’s not an excuse. I was born with
it.
He is breathing loudly.
ROMY (CONT’D)
(slowly and decisive)
I will never see him again. It
happened once. I don’t even know
his name.
JACOB
(calm)
I want you to leave. Now.
ROMY (CONT’D)
It has nothing to do with us.
With the -real- me. With our
family. I love you! Please-
I’m over it. It’s out of me,
out of my system.
JACOB (CONT’D)
What are you saying? ROMY (CONT’D)
I love you. Only you. Please.
JACOB (CONT’D)
(emotional)
It has everything to do with you!
There is no excuse for this! Not
your mom, not your childhood! You
fucking lied to me! To us!

Something needs to be at stake?? I
don’t give a shit about your
pathetic, banal sexual fantasies.
It’s not about that! You
jeopardized the most important
thing... your children! You make me
sick. Get the fuck out of my house!
Now.
Jacob storms out. Ashamed, Romy stays behind.
EXT. COUNTRY ROADS- NIGHT
From above we see Romy’s car make it’s way to their upstate
house.
EXT. UPSTATE HOUSE- NIGHT
A slow push in on the exterior of the house. Lights behind
the windows.
INT. UPSTATE HOUSE LIVING ROOM NIGHT
In the living room, Romy sits in the dark with her coat on,
next to the Christmas tree. She is smokes cigarette.
INT. UPSTATE HOUSE BEDROOM- NIGHT
Later: Romy sleeps in bed. She wears a nightgown over her
underwear. A sound wakes her up. Frightened, she gets up and
walks to the window. To her surprise she sees Samuel swimming
in the pool. Steam is rising off of the heated water.
EXT. UPSTATE HOUSE SWIMMING POOL-NIGHT
She walks up to the pool. Samuel keeps swimming.
ROMY
You have to leave. You have to go!
He reaches out his hand, as if he wants her to help him out
of the pool, but he pulls her towards him and drags her into
the water. For a moment it almost seems as if he wants to
drown her. Then he folds his body around hers. Gently he
kisses her.
SAMUEL
I could drown you, right here. No
one would know it was me.
JACOB (CONT’D)

ROMY
You should.
They kiss.
INT. UPSTATE HOUSE STUDY/ HALLWAY/ LIVING ROOM -NIGHT
At the fireplace Samuel and Romy sit wrapped in thick
blankets, opposite each other. With her finger she moves back
and forward in front of his face (her version of EMDR). He
follows her finger with his eyes. He smiles.
ROMY
5,4,3,2,1...
He closes his eyes.
ROMY (CONT’D)
How does it feel? What do you see?
He doesn’t answer. His cheeks turn red. His eyes twitch.
ROMY (CONT’D)
What does it smell like?
He starts to breathe heavy. A tear rolls down his face. He
looks like he is in pain. Romy takes his face in her hands.
ROMY (CONT’D)
(soft)
Hey, come back to me. Hey-
Slowly, he opens his eyes.
ROMY (CONT’D)
Are you ok?
She looks into his eyes.
ROMY (CONT’D)
What did you see?
He wipes his face. He avoids her gaze.
SAMUEL
You. I saw you.
After a moment of silence, Romy changes the subject:
ROMY
Did I mess with your head?
He thinks about it.
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 81.
White Production Draft (10/31/23) 82.
SMANUEL
Yes, you did. But so did I- with
yours.
She shakes her head.
SAMUEL
We’re equally responsible.
ROMY
(decisive)
No. That doesn’t make it okay.
They hear a sound. They look up and to their shock, they see
Jacob. Seemingly calm he looks back at them. No one speaks.
Slowly Samuel and Romy get up. A long beat.
JACOB
(Calm, to his wife)
Please, give us a minute- Just
leave us alone.
She doesn’t move.
JACOB (CONT’D)
Come on, Romy. Come on- Just give
me some time with him.
ROMY
No. Jacob- Lets stay calm.
Jacob takes her arm and tries to lead her out of the room but
Romy physically resists. When Jacob starts to push her out,
Samuel lays his hand on Jacob’s shoulder, which triggers
Jacob to immediately attack him.
ROMY (CONT’D)
Jacob! No!
The men start to fight. Samuel tries to deescalate, but to no
avail. Romy grabs her husband’s arms to make him stop. He
swiftly turns to her and pushes her out of the way.
JACOB
(to Romy)
Stay back!
Seeing him push Romy, Samuel attacks Jacob. Romy tries to
pull Samuel away from her husband. They destroy a chair; they
drag each other over the expensive carpet. They move from the
study into the hallway, all the way to the living room. Their
bodies so close it’s almost intimate.

White Production Draft (10/31/23) 83.
ROMY
Stop! Jesus Christ.
Romy manages to separate them. Both exhausted, the two men
catch their breath. Romy stands in between them.
JACOB
(under his breath)
You sat at my fucking table. You
talked to my girls.
Samuel looks at him.
JACOB (CONT’D)
How long? How fucking long?
(to Romy)
You lied to me- you fucking lied to
me!
Romy tries to keep Samuel calm, who’s eyes are dark with
aggression.
JACOB (CONT’D)
I felt sorry for you!
Jacob pushes Romy away. Samuel can’t help but be provoked to
engage again. He pushes Jacob onto the sofa. Jacob tries to
fight back. Samuel attacks him. He throws a punch.
CUT TO:
Time lapse- they are exhausted. The spotless living room is
now a war-zone. Panting, like tired animals, Samuel and
Jacobd sit in two different corners of the room. Quietly,
Romy comes in and hands each of them a bag of frozen peas.
Samuel holds it against his cheek. He starts to get up.
JACOB (CONT’D)
Sit down.
He does. They ice their bruises. Jacob studies Samuel’s face.
JACOB (CONT’D)
(strangely calm)
She used you. You know that right?
She abused you-
Samuel looks at him without blinking. A beat.
JACOB (CONT’D)
(quietly)
You think that’s intimacy?

SAMUEL
What?
JACOB
Humiliation- domination,
submission...whatever they call it-
It’s neurotic-
SAMUEL
(calm)
You’re wrong. You don’t understand.
JACOB
Female masochism is a male fantasy,
a male construct, don’t you fucking
get that?
SAMUEL
That’s a dated idea of sexuality.
He falls silent when he sees the desperation in Jacob’s eyes.
JACOB
A dated idea?
Samuel just looks at Jacob. He sees pain and panic. Jacob
can’t help himself. His body starts trembling until it
violently shakes. Jacob has a full on panic attack. He grabs
his chest, gasps for air. Worried, Romy tries to come closer,
grabs his arm.
JACOB (CONT’D)
(to Romy)
No, not you.
Quickly, Samuel takes a glass of water. He cautiously goes to
sit next to him and lets Jacob drink. Slowly Samuel lays his
hand on Jacob’s back, which seems to calm him down. Then
Jacob starts bringing his forehead to Samuel’s forehead.
Samuel isn’t sure if Jacob is going to head-butt him or wants
to be comforted by him. Head to head they breathe together.
They lock eyes. He sees how Jacob’s eyes s fill up with
tears. Jacob starts to cry. Samuel looks at him for a long
beat and whispers:
SAMUEL
I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.
Careful, Samuel gets up. He stands tall and looks at Romy and
Jacob, both sitting on the floor like two children. Calm, he
walks to the front door, opens it. Romy and Jacob stare at
the door as he walks away, leaving the door open behind him.
Light from the morning sun shines through.

PRE-LAB:
ESME
It is such a huge honor to have
been guided by a woman named Romy
Mathis.
INT. OFFICE BUILDING PRESS ROOM DAY
Close on Esme’s face in front of a green screen with the
Tensile logo behind her. She looks straight at us as she is
giving a speech for the company. At the bottom of the screen
we read: Esme Smith, Junior leadership coordinator.
ESME
...she understands the importance
of being a voice for your peers,
and an advocate for women around
the world who might not have the
opportunities that us, sitting
here, have.
CUT TO:
EXT. UPSTATE HOUSE- DAY
Romy stands behind the window, trapped and lonely in her
doll’s house. We hear Esme’s speech continue over the images
of Romy alone in the house. Time goes by.
ESME O.S.
So to be lifted up by a hero like
her makes this experience so much
more exceptional.
INT. OFFICE BUILDING PRESS ROOM-DAY
Esme looks into the camera and seems to address us directly.
ESME
Who are we, as women?
CUT TO:
INT. UPSTATE HOUSE BEDROOM- DAY
With her clothes on, Romy lays awake on the big bed. She
holds Nora’s teddy bear. Dirty dishes scattered around her. A
burning cigarette in her hand. Romy’s laptop next to her.

ESME O.S.
Modern leaders aren't afraid to
take chances, embrace change and
usher a team into the unknown.
CUT TO:
INT. UPSTATE HOUSE HALLWAY- NIGHT
Romy sits on the staircase, her hair a mess, with her phone
in her hand, waiting for Jacob to text her.
ESME O.S.
Sincerity, vulnerability and
radical self honesty create a work
environment of shared learning,
compassion and true connection.
INT OFFICE BUILDING PRESS ROOM DAY
Esme looks into the camera.
ESME
Now how do we do that? By making
changes from top to bottom to
support women at every level across
the company.
CUT TO:
EXT. UPSTATE HOUSE SWIMMING POOL DAY
Wrapped in a blanket, Romy stands at the edge of the pool.
She stares into the water. She smokes.
ESME O.S.
If we dare to let go of expectation
and move towards what scares us, we
can often find unexpected strength.
Romy throws the cigarette into the pool.
ESME O.S. (CONT’D)
Today we celebrate genuine
authenticity, and true uniqueness
in very individual that works at
Tensile.

INT. UPSTATE HOUSE- LIVING ROOM- EARLY MORNING
Time has passed. The house is a total mess. Romy is sleeping
on the sofa. Dirty plates with cigarette butts and half empty
glasses everywhere. The door opens.
ESME O.S.
We invite each other to show the
world who we really are, regardless
of peoples assumptions and without
fear.
Slowly, Isabel walks in. She looks around. Quickly, she
covers her nose with her hand. She kneels down next to her
mother and gently touches her face. When Romy opens her eyes,
she is surprised to see her daughter.
ISABEL
(soft, worried)
Hey- Are you ok? You look like
grandma.
ROMY
How did you get here?
ISABEL
I took a car.
ROMY
That’s expensive.
Romy smiles.
ISABEL
Mom, you need to come home. Dad
needs you. He refuses to leave the
theatre, he doesn't eat, he is
reading the bible.
Puzzled, Romy looks at her.
ISABEL (CONT’D)
He’ll forgive you.
Concerned, Romy looks up.
ROMY
What did he tell you?
ISABEL
Nothing.

White Production Draft (10/31/23) 88.
She takes her mother’s hand. Ashamed, Romy tries to hide her
face.
ISABEL (CONT’D)
Mary forgave me.
The sweet comparison touches Romy’s heart deeply.
ISABEL (CONT’D)
(tears in her eyes)
It’s ok, mom. He’ll forgive you.
She hugs her mother.
ISABEL (CONT’D)
Come on, lets go home.
INT. THEATER-DAY
Jacob sits alone in the dark and watches the empty stage. The
video wall is lowered half way, revealing the back walls of
the theatre. Romy enters quietly. She cautiously sits down
next to him. He looks frail. He doesn’t look at her.
ROMY
It’s my fault. I told you I was
someone else, and then I started to
get angry that you didn’t
understand who I really was. That’s
my- problem, not yours. I’m sorry.
I’m so sorry.
He looks at her.
EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREETS- DAY
Weeks later. A worker takes down some Christmas decorations.
INT. OFFICE BUILDING ROMY'S OFFICE-DAY
Romy is working on her laptop. Without knocking, Mr. Missel
walks into Romy’s office.
MR. MISSEL
This is a wonderful way to start
the new year! Huh? How are you
doing?
She smiles. He sits down. A long beat.

MR. MISSEL (CONT’D)
Mmm-(matter of factly)
Whatever happened to that intern?
The one that bought me the coffee?
Romy looks up.
MR. MISSEL (CONT’D)
I heard he was recruited by
Kawasaki, In Tokyo.
ROMY
Wow. Good for him.
MR. MISSEL
Good for you too.
He studies her face.
MR. MISSEL (CONT’D)
You didn't have anything to do with
that, did you?
She ignores his question.
MR. MISSEL (CONT’D)
Why don’t you come over next week
for drinks and we can talk about it-
She looks at his mouth, his skin. Her tone shifts.
ROMY
(calm)
Why don’t you fuck off, Sebastian?
MR. MISSEL
Careful Romy.
ROMY
I am not afraid of you, of whatever
the fuck you are capable of, of
what you know, of what you don't
know, I don't give a shit. Just
don't ever talk to me like that
again. If I want to be humiliated,
I will pay someone to do it. Now
get the fuck out of my office.
Romy takes a sip of coffee.

EXT. NEW YORK CITY MORNING
A series of images: Buildings in the mist. Slowly the skies
clear. An overhead shot of trees in Central Park. It’s
Spring. An insect crawling out of the dirt. Birds. Rats.
Squirrels.
INT. ROMY AND JACOB’S APARTMENT BEDROOM/ CHEAP HOTEL ROOM DAY
Close on Jacob’s face. He looks at Romy full of love. Romy
sits opposite him on the bed. She doesn't look away. They
stay focused on each other. Both of them are completely
vulnerable in this moment. Gently, Romy lays her hand on his
heart. A long beat as they keep looking into each others
eyes. Jacob smiles, Romy closes her eyes. Slowly, Jacob
guides her to lie down on her belly. In his own authentic
way, he dominates her. When he lovingly covers her eyes with
his hand, allowing her to surrender to herself, we cut to:
In the Cheap Hotel Room with the red walls, Samuel sits on
the bed. The dog we saw at the beginning of the film, is in
between his legs. Gently, he strokes her head.
Tenderly, Jacob’s hands move over Romy’s body.
Samuel stands in the middle of the room. The dog circles
around Samuel. Elegantly, he lifts his hand as a sign that
the dog should sit down. She obeys immediately. She follows
Samuel’s every move. In his hand he holds a cookie. The dog
takes it with her mouth
Jacob uses his fingers to pleasure her. Romy feels safe and
seen and is no longer ashamed of the thoughts and images in
her head.
Samuel sits on the bed and lovingly holds the dog in his
arms. When he slowly gets up, the dog jumps of the bed,
following him wherever he goes.
Back to the close up of Romy’s face. She starts to orgasm.
For real. It’s intense and raw. Even though she needed to
create a red room in her head, she is closer to Jacob than
ever before.
The dog stands next to Samuel. Together, they walk out of the
room.
Romy breathes out. She looks into the camera. Liberated.
