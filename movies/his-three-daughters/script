INT. APARTMENT — MORNING
KATIE is in her early 40s. She is sitting at a dinner table.
The apartment has been long lived in, modest, with books,
pictures and art on its walls. It is located high above a New
York City street.
She addresses someone sitting directly opposite, offscreen.
KATIE
So you’ve been good, right? I mean
other than this. He seems okay, at
least better than how I was
picturing. Not too different than
last time I was here. Hard to tell
whether he’s in pain, I mean at
least while he’s asleep. But you’ve
been on top of that, yes? Because I
think that’s the thing, is for it
to be as painless as possible. The
trick is, I guess the thing I’m
saying, is that I hope we can make
this easy, on him. Just not make a
thing out of anything. If we
disagree, we talk it out without
getting heated, or yelling, or
anything that’s going to upset him.
We handle it like adults, like the
age we are. I don’t really see what
there is to disagree about,
anyways. At the end of the day, the
hard truth is, is that he’s dying
and there’s nothing either one of
us can do to stop that from
happening. I’m not trying to be
cold, but it’s a matter of being
there for him, being here. Things
from the past don’t matter, not
right now. If there are things to
work out, they can wait. I really
hope you agree. I’m upset. I know
you are too. We all are. It’s hard.
It sucks. Let’s not make it harder,
ok? I did see...I did see that the
DNR never got signed like I asked.
Quite a few times. I got it, it’s
not that easy...well it was easy,
actually. And now, it’s a lot
harder—I’m not making this a thing—
I’m just saying it’s harder now
that he’s not seeing doctors.

I have to figure out how to get Dr.
Sanders here, or someone who can
witness his signature, and it would
have been just a lot simpler when
you were taking him in. And I don’t
know how much time I have. He has.
It’s important. It’s really
important.
CHRISTINA enters the room and takes a seat nearby. She is in
her 30s.
CHRISTINA
He opened his eyes for a bit. That
was nice. He knows we are here. I
could tell that made him happy. I
know... I know...
(Katie takes her hand)
I promise, I won’t be like this the
whole time. I’m not going to just
cry through it all. Just for now.
It’s weird to be away, you know,
from Mirabella and David. That’s
part of it. It’s really my first
time.
KATIE (OFF CAMERA)
Oh, you could have brought them.
CHRISTINA
No, it’s good they’re not here.
They’re fine. I’d rather the memory
be from our last visit. He was
better. That’s what hurts about
this more, he was still sick, of
course, but he was still so there.
So able. I just thought things
wouldn’t get to this. Not so
suddenly. I’ve seen too many
movies, probably. Especially the
ones made for children, with
Mirabella, these past couple years.
Everything so nice, bright. Even if
they get heavy, there’s a beauty
and clarity to it all. This feels
so real...I’m rambling, I’m sorry.
It’s the jet lag. I get even more
emotional when I fly. Anyways, it’s
nice that it’s us, just us. This is
the way it should be. The way that
he would want it. I interrupted
something though, I’m sorry. How
are you, Rachel?

CHRISTINA (CONT’D)

I feel like we haven’t spoken since
Thanksgiving. How are you?
RACHEL, who has been sitting directly across from Katie this
entire time, is in her early 40s. Her chair is big and worn
— unlike the simple table chairs the others sit in.
She looks nothing like Katie or Christina.
RACHEL
I’m all good.
Silence.
RACHEL (CONT’D)
I don’t know what you want me to
say. I’m good. That’s basically it.
KATIE (OFF CAMERA)
Well, she’s definitely high. The
whole place stinks like weed.
RACHEL
Fuck yes, I’m high. High as a
motherfucker. First thing I do in
the morning is roll a blunt. And
then I smoke at least three more
throughout the day. You know why?
Because that’s how I do shit.
KATIE (O.C.)
I don’t care that you smoke weed.
It’s just not right to smoke it in
the house, when someone is sick.
RACHEL
Daddy doesn’t mind. Trust me, I’ve
been smoking around him for all
this time and he never had an
issue. In fact, he likes the smell.
Told me more than a few times.
KATIE (O.C.)
It’s the smoke. The smoke, not the
smell. The man is dying, just go
outside.
RACHEL
Damn, it took you five minutes,
five minutes, right? For you just
to get in my shit. A second ago, it
was how let’s just get along—
CHRISTINA (CONT’D)
3.
4.
CHRISTINA (O.C.)
Yes. Yes. Let’s settle down.
There’s no reason for this to
become an issue—
KATIE (O.C.)
—and for her just to take her
shitty weed and smoke it outside.
RACHEL
Shitty weed? Please. I get top
shelf, not that dogshit you smoked
all day long. Right? You think I
forgot that?
KATIE
That was high school. I’ve grown up
quite a lot since then, unlike
others.
RACHEL
Grown up, still a bitch.
CHRISTINA
Rachel! Katie! No. Let’s just stop.
Look.
Christina indicates someone has entered the room.
CHRISTINA (CONT’D)
Hi! Were you trying to find us?
Please, please, sit down.
ANGEL is dressed causally, respectfully. Very clean. He is in
his early 30s.
CHRISTINA (O.S.) (CONT’D)
I’m sorry, we were just—
ANGEL
Nothing to apologize for. I
understand what a stressful
situation this is. It’s natural.
It’s a hard time. But, while my
partner, Mirabella, is in the room
with your father, I was hoping to
talk you through where we are at
the moment.
CHRISTINA (O.S.)
Mirabella?! That’s my daughter’s
name! Wow.
4.
5.
ANGEL
Really? It’s a beautiful name.
CHRISTINA (O.S.)
She’s three.
ANGEL
That’s nice. And it’s also very
nice that you are all here. At a
time like this. It’s not always
like that. Things happen in
families. Sometimes people can’t be
here for health reasons. Sometimes
it’s just, you know, other issues.
I understand his wife passed some
years ago.
KATIE
He was married twice.
Rachel looks at Katie.
CHRISTINA
Yes. She did. Breast cancer. About
twenty years ago. Right?
Christina looks at Rachel, who doesn’t respond.
ANGEL
I’m really sorry to hear that. I
don’t know what that process was
like, but I think it would be
helpful to understand the process
here, now that your father is off
food and liquid. I, or Mirabella,
or both if possible, will be here
each morning, around this time, but
you will have my number and I will
do my best to answer any questions,
or come here, if need be. It will
be us you call, when he does pass.
We can make the declaration of
death, unless a medical reason
brings him to the hospital
beforehand.
CHRISTINA (O.S.)
I’m sorry, it’s just so weird
that’s her name. I keep picturing
my daughter when you mention her.
Sorry, please go on.
5.

ANGEL
So, it’s good news that he responds
well to the pain treatment. His
cancer is very advanced, and when
we are in pain, our bodies
naturally try to fight it, even if
it’s actually just hurting us more.
His ease will possibly quicken the
process, in an organic way. That’s
really the big difference between
hospice and hospital care, which
aims to extend life. As painless as
possible is our goal, always. But
another thing is, it’s not just our
bodies that affect the time it
takes to pass. I can’t tell you the
science on this, but in the twelve
years I have been working in
hospice, it has become very clear
to me that the mind is just as big
a factor as the body. And that is
really where you can be a huge
help, in case he is holding on, not
wanting to go out of fear. You can
help in letting him know,
reassuring him, that it’s okay. The
mind doesn’t have power to heal or
reverse the disease, not at the
stage it is. But if he knows it
will be okay, that you all will be
okay, it could mean a great deal.
Angel looks at them kindly.
KATIE
Sorry, Angel, right? Angel, that’s
quite a name considering what you
do. I need to ask you, my father
was supposed to sign a DNR, a “Do
Not Resuscitate” form, but for
whatever reason, it didn’t happen
while he was still going to his
doctors. It’s still very important
to him though, which is one of the
reasons I wanted to know how much
time he had. I get it, it’s not a
simple math equation, but—

INT. APARTMENT — DAY
The dining room area and the living room have no wall between
them, are adjacent to each other and sharing the same space.
The living room area presses up against one end of the
apartment, which has a few windows to the outside, revealing
that the building is in a complex alongside identical ones.
Katie stands in the corner of the living room area, next to a
couch facing a TV resting on a NY Jets banner, and a shelf of
predominately American history books.
She is on her phone.
KATIE
—well, he wasn’t clear. It sounds
like it could happen anytime, or it
could be a few days. Maybe longer.
I mean, you should see him, he
doesn’t look well. It was only a
month ago I saw him, I think, but
seems like years looking at him
now. The plan is, at least at the
moment, I’ll stay here, we all will
take turns watching over. We’ll be
together when it happens. I’m sure
that if I left, the moment I left,
and got too far away to rush back,
is when it would happen. Y’know?
She pauses to listen to faint singing from another room.
Katie puts the phone back to her ear.
KATIE (CONT’D)
Can you hear that? That’s Christina
singing to him in his room right
now. I don’t know. Let’s just hope
it’s not Grateful Dead, that will
kill him right away. He hated that
music as much as I did. She’s fine,
she’s good. At least she appears to
be, like always. Hope the singing
doesn’t go on too much... Could
kill me.
Katie turns.
KATIE (CONT’D)
She... She’s exactly who she’s
always been. I asked her to do one
simple thing, get the damn DNR
signed, which now is much more
complicated to do.

I was hoping the hospice guy could
help, but it really seems I need to
somehow get a physician here, to
the house, and time it, again,
somehow, to when he’s awake and
somewhat coherent. She’s out now. I
asked her to stop smoking weed in
the house and she got all upset.
It’s like she can’t even wait till
he’s dead so that the apartment
will be hers. See if I give a fuck
what she does in here after that.
Not my responsibility.

EXT. APARTMENT COURTYARD — SAME TIME - DAY
Rachel sits on a bench among a few empty ones. Other than
nearby traffic, it’s quiet. As if there was no one else.
Rachel puts a blunt in her mouth. She lights it, inhales
deeply.
Long exhale.
She takes another huge draw.
MAN (O.S.)
Rachel. What are you doing? You
know you can’t be doing that out
here?
Rachel tries to speak as she exhales.
RACHEL
Vi...c...to...or.
Rachel puts up a finger for him to hold on, coughs.
RACHEL (CONT’D)
Damn, Victor. What are you doin’?
You fucked my whole shit up.
VICTOR
You shouldn’t be doing your whole
shit here. That’s the problem.
RACHEL
Shit’s legal now. What are you
stuck in the nineties when you last
blazed?

VICTOR
Please. I smoke every night, but
when I get home, inside my own
apartment. You know how it is here.
These people lose it when someone
smokes a cigarette out here. They
ask me to call the cops. It’s
crazy. Why aren’t you inside where
I can just call you with a
complaint and you can tell me to go
fuck myself?
Rachel takes another long draw.
RACHEL
Okay. Last. One....
Exhales and speaks.
RACHEL (CONT’D)
My..bitch...ass...sister. She’s
trying to say the smoke is killing
our dad.
VICTOR
How is Vinnie?
RACHEL
He’s fucking dying! But not from my
weed smoke! She’s just a fucking...
It’s got to be something. Now she
got me out here, trying to chill,
and getting yelled at—I know, I
know—I don’t mean any disrespect.
You know I love you. But she’s who
you should be yelling at, not me.
I’m just trying to maintain,
y’know?

INT. APARTMENT — HALLWAY — SOMETIME LATER - DAY
A bedroom door opens, and Christina peers out just as Rachel
is attempting to walk by.
CHRISTINA
Hey! Do you want to come in and
join us? The nurse is about to show
up and we could all circle around
him before she gets here. We could
sing to him.

Or if you want, you and he could be
alone until she arrives. That’s
fine too. He’s just sleeping, but
he looks super peaceful.
Medical equipment is beeping from inside. Rachel shakes her
head no.
CHRISTINA (CONT’D)
Are you sure? Ok, well. If you
change your mind. I don’t want you
to feel like we’ve invaded your
space at all.
Christina shuts the door softly.

INT. APARTMENT — KITCHEN — LATE AFTERNOON
KATIE
Christina. Christina.
Katie is kneeling on the floor of the kitchen, before an open
refrigerator door. Christina, hearing herself being called
from nearby, enters.
Katie pulls a bag of apples out of the fridge, holds it up.
KATIE (CONT’D)
This is what’s in here. Not just
one bag of apples. Three bags. And
you know what? All of them look
old, they’ve gone soft. And that’s
it. Seriously. You can see for
yourself. Three bags of apples,
some old condiments from who knows
when, and that’s it. I mean,
really, how old is she?
CHRISTINA
I can run out now and do some
shopping.
KATIE
No. I’ll go. But that’s not the
point. Damien is nine and he can
take better care of himself. The
moment dad wasn’t able, I mean,
this is all she got. That’s just
the last few weeks. What the hell
is going to happen to her
afterwards?

I’ll tell you one thing, it’s not
going to be us. You live halfway

family to take care of, and I have
enough on my plate with my own.
More than enough. She is so fucked,
but it can’t become my problem.

INT. APARTMENT — LIVING ROOM AREA — SUNDOWN
Christina is on the phone, and is looking at a picture on the
bookshelf of an older woman who resembles Rachel.
CHRISTINA
—she’s out shopping right now. Yes.
Staying here too. We’re taking
shifts, watching over him. There’s
a nurse in with him now, she comes
for four hours each day around now.
It’s...good. I’m not sure. He’s
kind of in and out, sometimes he
says something, but mostly he is
asleep. Just think the pain
medication is...you know. It’s
weird. It’s fine. I can’t guess how
long, no one can. I don’t want to
guess. But I think. I will be home.
Soon. It’s fine, it’s fine, thank
you. But really want to hear how
things are there. Are you guys
having fun?
CUT TO:
INT. RACHEL’S BEDROOM — SAME TIME - SUNDOWN
Rachel is watching a baseball game on a TV propped up on a
pile of clothes, many of them sports jerseys. The room is
small, her bed takes up most of it. There are dirty dishes,
cups, lighters, empty rolling papers scattered throughout.
A poster of Luis Firpo knocking Jack Dempsey out of the ring
has been hanging on a wall for years. So has one of Audrey
Hepburn.
Rachel shifts her attention between the TV and phone, where a
different game plays simultaneously. Winning bet receipts and
ticket stubs are taped on the wall behind her.

Christina’s conversation with her child carries quietly
through the wall. Rachel lowers the volume so she can hear.
CHRISTINA (O.S.)
I miss her so much. I miss you. I
miss you both so damn much. What,
it hasn’t been a day yet, and all I
can think of is being back there
with you both. This is so not home
anymore. I’m so lucky. You have no
idea, trust me, I know.
Rachel brings the television volume back up.

angel! Yes, yes, it’s me, mommy.
Hello, my sweet beautiful
Mirabella, how I’ve missed you!
Have you been missing me? I heard
you have been having so much fun
with Poppa! No, no, I’m crying
because I’m just so happy to be
hearing your voice, mommy’s not
sad. She’s happy because she loves
you and can’t wait to see you and—
Mirabella, you know what? I met a
woman today—she helps people— she’s
like a doctor... She is a doctor,
and guess what her name is?

INT. APARTMENT — DINING ROOM AREA - NIGHT
Katie has not only done the shopping, but has made the dinner
she serves. Christina enters the area from a hallway that
leads to the other side of the apartment.
KATIE
How does he seem?
CHRISTINA
He’s still asleep. We have another
half hour with the nurse. Alejowon.
Alezown? Alejown. She’s nice.

KATIE
Do we feed her? There’s enough.
CHRISTINA
I can ask.
KATIE
Maybe, yes. She probably wants to
get home. Who knows how long she
has to travel. But, yes, I think.
Let’s offer. If anything, it will
help if she doesn’t hate us.
Christina pauses.
KATIE (CONT’D)
And, what about her?
Katie indicates a room by the hallway’s entrance, the only
room visible from the dining area.
KATIE (CONT’D)
I don’t want to intrude on her
privacy—
The two slip into a childhood language:
CHRISTINA
Iitherg doitugnt we woelitugd be.
(I don’t think we would be.)
KATIE
If yoitherg thitugnk so.
(If you think so.)
CHRISTINA
I’ll let her know there’s food and
she’s invited.
KATIE
Right. Right. I made food for her.
You can tell her that, I made food
for her. If she wants. Let the
nurse know, and then let her know.
Christina nods, and goes to get the nurse.
JUMP CUT TO:
INT. APARTMENT — DINING ROOM AREA — NIGHT
Christina is mostly finished with her meal.
13.
14.
CHRISTINA
— anything green. I have no idea
why. If it’s green, she won’t eat
it. We have seriously considered
dyeing her food. Just a little
fruit color. Seriously. She
wouldn’t know if a cucumber was
purple. I mean. Maybe it will
confuse her when she gets older.
Katie is across from her, still eating.
KATIE
Well, you can count on that. Won’t
be the only thing. Lots of things
to confuse them when they get
older.
CHRISTINA
Have things become a bit better?
KATIE
With Tracy? Better is relative.
What do you mean “better”? Is she
talking to us, yes. Is she a full
of shit, snotty teenager most of
the time, treating us— me
especially— like an enemy whose
only job as a parent is to stop her
from doing what she wants? Yes. I
don’t... I don’t... Let’s not, ok?
Katie looks down the table, at Rachel, who is staring at her
phone.
KATIE (CONT’D)
How do you like the food?
Silence builds until Rachel realizes the question is for her.
RACHEL
What was that?
KATIE
The food. The food that I made. Are
you enjoying it?
RACHEL
Yes. I like the food you made.
Thank you for making the food you
made. The food you made tastes
good. I have a parlay going and I’m
on the final team, that’s why I am
looking at my phone. I’m working.

KATIE
You mean you are watching a game,
that you bet on.
RACHEL
Uh huh. Bet on four. Won three. 10
bucks to make 270.
KATIE
Do you think watching will change
its outcome?
Rachel gets up, takes her plate to the kitchen, which is
visible from the dining table area.
RACHEL
Thank you for the dinner.
KATIE

INT. APARTMENT — LATE NIGHT
The kitchen dishwasher ends its cycle, and the house becomes
quiet. There is little street noise. The father’s bedroom,
which lines the hallway and is opposite Rachel’s bedroom, has
its door cracked open. Machine beeps emit from within, and
echo throughout the apartment.
Another machine inside the father’s room is audible; it rises
and falls with his breathing. Katie, visible through the
doorway sliver, is asleep on a chair.
Christina is in a different room, one half filled with
storage. She is on a single bed, under the blankets, propped
up on her pillow, scrolling through pictures on her phone.

Katie is writing on a small pad. She crosses out something,
starts again. A cup of coffee is nearby, still hot.
Someone enters the room, taking Katie’s attention.
KATIE
That’s funny.
Christina is wearing pajama bottoms and a 2003 Tour shirt of
The Dead.
KATIE (CONT’D)
Your shirt.
CHRISTINA
Oh...yeah. I found it in one of the
boxes in my room. I really should
go through them all, and take with
me what I want. Get rid of the
rest. But yeah, this. I was happy
to find it.
KATIE
You still love them. But you don’t
still go to shows, do you?
CHRISTINA
I’ve been known to drive a few
hours if need be.
KATIE
John Mayer?
CHRISTINA
Sure. Family is family.
Why aren’t you asleep? You were
with him till four.
KATIE
I can’t sleep when I know they have
to get to school. I was texting all
three of them. Jay’s worse than the
kids. But he got them there, that’s
something. Tracy skipped breakfast,
of course. I slept a bit before,
I’ll get some more later. You know
she hasn’t done a shift, right?
CHRISTINA
Who?

Katie waits for Christina to realize who she is talking
about.
CHRISTINA (CONT’D)
Oh...yeah. I’m not sure. I should
probably get back in there with
him, I was just getting some water.
KATIE
You don’t find that strange? Once
we get here, she steps back from
all responsibility?
Christina turns towards the kitchen.
KATIE (CONT’D)
The coffee is still hot.
CHRISTINA
Thanks.
KATIE
I’ve been working on his obituary.
Would be good if you could read
over, when you can.

INT. APARTMENT — LIVING ROOM AREA — MORNING
Katie is on the phone.
KATIE
— yes, I understand that. But if he
can’t do it, I need someone to come
here who can authorize his
signature. This is extremely
important to him. I understand
that, yes, but here we are, and now
he’s too sick to go anywhere. He
can die any minute, so really, I
just need a solution—
Behind her, Rachel is walking quietly to the bathroom,
located at the far corner of the living room area. Katie
turns just after she’s passed.
KATIE (CONT’D)
—yes, please. I’ll wait.
Katie is on hold. She takes a few steps towards the bathroom.
The apartment door buzzes. Katie looks at the time.

KATIE (CONT’D)

That’s going to be Angel and
Mirabella!
Christina is already exiting their father’s room.
CHRISTINA
Yes, yes, got it.
Katie, still on hold, looks to the end of the apartment, at
Christina by the intercom, then to the shut bathroom door.
INT. BATHROOM — SAME TIME
Rachel is sitting on the closed lid of the toilet, smoking a
spliff. She cranes to blow smoke out of a small window.
Her sisters can be heard greeting the hospice workers.
Rachel takes her time.

RACHEL
Hey.
Rachel, still in her pajamas, is on her way from the bathroom
to her bedroom when she passes Angel, who sits at the table
with Katie and Christina.
ANGEL
Good morning. Rachel, right?
She nods. Christina gives her a small wave, Katie just looks.
Rachel appears to be very happily stoned.
KATIE
Do you want to put some clothes on
and join us? Angel was just telling
us about where he thinks things
are.
RACHEL
Um. Sure.
In no rush, she walks away towards her room.
Silence.

KATIE
How about some coffee?
ANGEL
Sure. Would love some.
Angel begins to get out of his chair.

INT. DINING ROOM AREA — SOON AFTER
Angel, back in the chair, puts his coffee cup down.
ANGEL
So, yeah, I was saying to your
sisters that Vincent appears, to
me, to be much further along than
when I saw him yesterday. I don’t
want to imply that I know when he
will pass. I’d say my guesses have
been as wrong as much as they have
been right, and I have seen people
at a similar condition as your
father hold on a lot longer than I
would have thought. I’m just
saying, as best as you can, please
prepare yourself, especially for
him to become even less coherent.
Have you been able to have any
conversations recently?
CHRISTINA
Yes. I mean, small ones. There are
windows when he says a few words in
response to something. He’s thought
I was someone I’m not, or asked for
something that doesn’t make sense.
He seems to think he still has
work, or a deadline of some kind.
ANGEL
Work is a big one. I mean, even if
the job sucked, you know, and they
couldn’t wait for the day to
retire. Even still, it’s the cycle
of familiarity that could be what’s
needed now. I’m hoping you all
will, if you want, take whatever
windows you can, to say whatever
you feel must be said. If you want.
Now would be the time.

KATIE
This DNR form...
ANGEL
Right.
KATIE
It’s very hard to get someone here.
And now, with what you are saying,
it feels even more impossible.
ANGEL
Yes. Yes, I understand that it’s
really important for you.
KATIE
For him. I know what happens, what
can happen without one. EMT cracked
the ribs of my close friend’s
mother, almost all of them, trying
to bring her back after she had
just about passed peacefully. The
poor lady was left brain dead for
another three weeks, completely
broken and bruised, and that’s not
something my father wants. When he
goes, he should be allowed to go.
You understand that, right?
ANGEL
I do. I do. Sometimes... Sometimes
people don’t call EMT right away
when they believe their loved one
has passed away. Sometimes...they
are not completely sure, and it
delays that call for a while. And
because we are helping, you should
call us rather than 911.
Angel is looking directly at Katie.
KATIE
Right. Right. But what happens if
suddenly he needs to go to the
hospital for some reason?
ANGEL
I’m a firm believer in “Do Not
Resuscitate” orders. I just can’t
sign them.

INT. APARTMENT — DAY
Katie knocks on Rachel’s door.
RACHEL (O.S.)
Yes?
Eventually, Rachel opens her door. A magazine is on her lap,
she is rolling a blunt. A baseball game is on her television.
KATIE
Here’s the thing. I get it that you
don’t want to go into his room.
Sure, I was there till four a.m.
and Christina has basically been in
there since. The help would be
appreciated, but look, everyone
deals with death their own way, and
I am not going to tell you what to
do. That’s between you, and him,
and however you think you should
run your life. But what I am going
to ask you to do is not act like a
teenager and sneak smoking in the
bathroom. It’s not sneaking. The
whole place reeks of it, and I’m
not even asking for you to do it
for him, even though he can’t speak
for himself. I’m asking for me. I’m
asking you to respect me, and my
wishes, and while he’s alive and
I’m here, to smoke outside. That’s
it. Afterwards, this will be your
place, you’re on the lease, and you
will be free to do whatever you
want and I will have no say. You
want only rotten apples in the
fridge, not my business. You want
to do bong hits all day and all
night, not my business. But for
now, whenever you step outside to
smoke, think “I’m respecting
Katie”, and I’ll know that you are
respecting me. Okay? Okay?
RACHEL
Sure.
She closes her door.
CUT TO:
21.

EXT. APARTMENT COURTYARD — AFTERNOON
Rachel sits on her regular bench, smoking another blunt.
She shifts as someone steps outside.
RACHEL
I don’t want to hear it. Not in the
mood.
VICTOR (O.C.)
Rachel—
RACHEL
I love you Victor, but truly, fuck
off. Call whoever you want, do
whatever you want. I really do not
give a fuck. Shit is legal is all I
know.
Victor watches her for a moment longer before heading back
into the building.
Rachel takes multiple draws until she can’t inhale anymore.
RACHEL (CONT’D)
Goddamn right, get the fuck out of
here with that bullshit.
A person walks by with kids.
RACHEL (CONT’D)
How you doing? Doing ok?
PARENT (O.C.)
You know, you know. Trying to get
by.
RACHEL
Yes I do, I do know, brother. I’d
say take a seat with me but you got
little ones with you.
PARENT (O.C.)
It’s all good, thanks.
RACHEL
They’ll be out here soon enough,
don’t worry about it. Lighting up a
big fattie of their own.
PARENT (O.C.)
Don’t I know it. Don’t I know it.
22.
(MORE)
23.
The parent and kids are now out of earshot.
RACHEL
Fucking kids.
She’s about to greet the next person approaching, but
suddenly stops. This person stands right before her, off
camera, and the two look at each other for a good moment.
Eventually, Christina takes a seat next to Rachel.
CHRISTINA
I came out. Thought I’d get a bit
of air.
Rachel says nothing.
CHRISTINA (CONT’D)
It’s easy to forget the outside
exists. It’s good to step out, take
a breath. I haven’t sat here for a
long time. Probably years. But it’s
nice. I forgot about it. I
definitely remember taking some
time out here, just sitting. I
remember needing it. It’s strange
the things you forget, things that
are good for you. Like just
stepping out of things for a
minute. How are you? I know this is
not easy having Katie and I invade
your space the way we have.
RACHEL
It’s not my space.
CHRISTINA
Well, it is, I mean, it’s dad’s and
yours. But you know, soon, it will
be yours. I’m planning on getting
my storage out. Either in the
garbage, or back home with me. I’m
sorry I’ve left things in there as
long as I have, I won’t leave you
with that.
RACHEL
I don’t care. It’s not in my room,
it’s not my business.
CHRISTINA
I do, and I’m just saying there’s
no reason for it to stay here. We
have plenty of space.

23.
CHRISTINA (CONT’D)
(MORE)
24.
Too much space. I guess enough for
another child, when the time comes.
Mirabella is a handful as it is,
you know? Hard to imagine two, but
they say it gets easier. That’s
what they say, at least. I know
David is ready. What about you?
RACHEL
What about me?
CHRISTINA
Kids, do you want children?
Rachel laughs.
RACHEL
I’m sorry, but you’re crazy. No
offense, just kinda nuts.
CHRISTINA
I am? What do you mean? Crazy how?
In what way? Really.
RACHEL
I dunno. Maybe it’s all those wacky
mushrooms and shit you took.
Fucking Grateful Dead. That’s some
kooky shit.
CHRISTINA
Yeah, yeah, right. You know...you
know, it’s not really like that.
I’m sure for some, but it was never
about that for me.
RACHEL
Okay, okay, I’m just playing. I’m
high, that’s it, forget it. No, no,
I’m not thinking about having kids.
CHRISTINA
It’s fine, trust me. I got it a lot
in the past. People have this
picture, naked in the mud and all
that Woodstock stuff. But the truth
is, the shows...it’s a group of
people, who look out for each
other. That’s it. Everyone joined
by this one love of a music, which
allows them to connect and to
relate and to care.
CHRISTINA (CONT’D)

CHRISTINA (CONT’D)
25.
It’s for people who haven’t found
that anywhere else. Who weren’t
given that, and had to find it for
themselves.
Rachel studies Christina.
CHRISTINA (CONT’D)
Yeah. At least for some. Not
everyone.
Rachel continues to watch her.
CHRISTINA (CONT’D)
Anyways, I should probably walk a
bit. I’ll pick up some food, do you
want anything specific? Anything in
particular?
Rachel shakes here head.
RACHEL
I’m good, thanks.
CHRISTINA
Okay, see you soon.
RACHEL
Yep. See you soon.
Rachel watches Christina walk away until she disappears.
CUT TO:
INT. APARTMENT — LIVING ROOM AREA — LATE AFTERNOON
Katie is on the phone.
KATIE
— I was given your number from Dr.
Robert Sanders’ office, as a
potential place that can make a
house call. Well, my father, my
father is very sick. He’s dying.
Thank you. Yes, and he wants to
sign a “Do Not Resuscitate” form,
but is too sick to come in. Yes,
he’s conscious. I mean, not all the
time. He’s in hospice care, here at
home. Do you think the doctor
would—
Christina bursts into the room.
CHRISTINA (CONT’D)
25.

CHRISTINA
Katie! Katie!
Katie sees her sister, rushes towards her.
KATIE
What is it?
CHRISTINA
His breathing. It’s gotten really
strange. Something is happening!
Katie rushes into their father’s room. Christina pauses,
watching her pass, then looks at Rachel’s door.
She knocks on it.
CHRISTINA (CONT’D)
Rachel. Rachel. You should come.
His breathing... Something’s wrong!
Rachel cracks open her bedroom door. She looks terrified. She
doesn’t move.
JUMP CUT TO:
INT. APARTMENT — MOMENTS LATER
The house is quiet. Still. Sounds from outside. Passing cars,
music, exhaust fans. The hallway leading to the father’s
bedroom is dark. Katie’s notepad is on the table, the
obituary is incomplete. Her handwriting is strong, clear,
quite beautiful. Lots crossed out. It’s been challenging.
The father’s bedroom door is open, Rachel is standing in its
doorway, looking in from the hallway. The beeping sound is
steady, the breathing machine rhythmic.
Soft crying.
More beeps. More breaths. Whispers:
KATIE (O.C.)
He’s ok.
CHRISTINA (O.C.)
He’s ok.
A laugh. Laughing. Relief.
Rachel, pale, exhales.

INT. APARTMENT — SUNDOWN
Katie is opening a bottle of wine in the kitchen. Christina
enters. They hug.
KATIE
Oh my fucking God.
CHRISTINA
It’s crazy. I thought... I
thought... I don’t know.
KATIE
Well, I do know that that fucker is
strong, damnit. Can’t count him out
till he’s ready.
CHRISTINA
I see you are celebrating.
KATIE
Better believe it. I knew there was
a reason why I got wine. Didn’t
know it’d be for celebrating life,
but hey. I’ll pour you some.
CHRISTINA
Just a bit. Angel said he’d be here
soon. We shouldn’t be, you know,
partying when he gets here. Could
be a bad look.
KATIE
Angel. Angel of death more like it.
Katie hands Christina more wine than she asked for.
KATIE (CONT’D)
Just drink it. Cheers. To dad.
They clink glasses.
KATIE (CONT’D)
You got what he was saying before,
right? Angel? Don’t call him or
anyone until dad’s good and dead.
Make sure the guy’s not breathing,
and then some.
CHRISTINA
I should go back to his room. Make
sure things are still steady.
27.

KATIE
Angel of death. Comes in and plucks
them away. Go on.
Christina leaves. Katie finishes her glass and pours another.
CUT TO:
INT. RACHEL'S BEDROOM — NIGHT
Rachel is watching a game on her television. She switches
channels to another game.
BENJY
Don’t do that. Stop doing that.
BENJY is around the same age as Rachel. They sit on her bed,
backs against the wall, close enough so that their arms are
touching. Benjy is rolling a blunt.
RACHEL
I need to see both. I have money on
both.
BENJY
Doesn’t matter. Watch one. Annoying
as fuck going back and forth. Just
pick whatever game matters most and
stick with it. I don’t even know
what’s going on with either of
them, back and forth, back and
forth.
Rachel eventually puts the remote down.
BENJY (CONT’D)
Thank you.
RACHEL
We have to go outside to smoke
that.
Benjy licks the blunt closed.
RACHEL (CONT’D)
It’s been requested.
BENJY
We’re watching a game.
RACHEL
It’s alright. It’s not worth it.

29.
INT. DINING ROOM AREA — SAME TIME
Katie is taking a sip from her third glass of wine. Angel is
in the midst of talking.
ANGEL
—it’s no problem at all. It’s my
job. I’m glad you called when I was
close enough that I could get here
as quick as I could. Another thirty
minutes would have been heading to
Queens.
CHRISTINA
Well, obviously we are happy that
he’s still with us, but about the
sound he made when his breathing
got hard. My concern —our concern—
is that he’s in pain.
Angel nods.
ANGEL
Yes, I’m sure Mirabella is looking
into this right now. Tolerance to
the drip definitely goes up, as
does pain. For sure, I’d suggest we
increase the morphine. It’s just a
fine line that we must figure out,
enough to help, but not to kill.
Once Mirabella’s ready, she’ll come
out and tell us.
KATIE
But, you see what I was saying?
Before, right? We could have called
911. We would have, if the
breathing continued like that for a
while. It was clear he was in pain,
and we don’t know what to do.
ANGEL
I do. I did. Trust me, the last
thing anyone wants is that in-
between place. We all want him to
transition as peaceful as possible.
But Mirabella should be a help, she
will tell us exactly how much more
can be administered.
KATIE
And what if the same thing happens,
he’s in pain and we give him more
than what she recommends?
29.
(MORE)
30.
ANGEL
Well, you can’t intentionally do
that. That’s looked upon as murder
in this city. In most of this
country, at this time, even if it
is asked for by the patient. The
only way to do that, is to make a
mistake. For it to be
unintentional. Maybe someone didn’t
measure the amount correctly.
Sometimes, if the amount is just
over, it can be lethal. I don’t
know, I don’t know. But, mistakes
have been made. And accidents are
natural, right?
Katie gives Christina a look, takes a sip.
ANGEL (CONT’D)
I’m sorry that he was in pain. I
understand how terrible that must
have been for you to witness. But,
here he is, with you, and not in a
hospital. With hope that things
will continue ahead as peaceful as
possible.
JUMP CUT TO:
INT. APARTMENT — NIGHT
KATIE
Angel of mother fucking death. Did
I call it or did I call it?
CHRISTINA
He’s trying to be helpful. You’re
the one who’s asking him.
KATIE
Oh I know, and he is. Trust me, I
appreciate it. But I’m not aiming
to overdose our dad, “accidentally”
as Angel was suggesting. I just
don’t want him to be hurting.
CHRISTINA
We should probably figure out
dinner while the nurse is here.
KATIE
Okay, you don’t want to go there.
That’s fine. You want more?
(MORE)

KATIE (CONT’D)
31.
There’s at least two glasses left
in this bottle. There’s another, if
we want to open it.
CHRISTINA
I’m good, I’m goo—
Christina and Katie turn to see Rachel and Benjy going into
her room. They carry plastic bags, and have been outside.
Before Rachel can fully close the door behind her—
KATIE
Rachel. Rachel.
Rachel says something to Benjy who is already inside her
bedroom, then shuts its door. She comes over.
RACHEL
Yes? Is there a problem?
KATIE
Is there a problem? You tell me?
RACHEL
Please, don’t start. We smoked
outside as you asked. Now we are
back in my room, taking care of
ourselves.
KATIE
You don’t think it’s a bit weird? I
mean, it’s kind of strange, no?
Having a random person over to the
house, now? At a time like this?
You really think it’s right to have
a stranger here when he may pass at
any minute?
RACHEL
He’s not random. Benjy and I have
been hanging out for a while now.
Just because you don’t know him,
doesn’t mean he’s a stranger. And
daddy likes him. That’s what
matters.
KATIE
Okay.
Rachel lingers for a moment.
RACHEL
Okay.
KATIE (CONT’D)

her.

—yeah it’s ok, now. I mean, it was
terrifying. I was so sure he was
going. His breathing sounded crazy,
his face, I hope I can get that
image out of my mind. Yes. Yes,
they’ve given him more now, he’s
sleeping. I don’t know if there
will be any more windows. I’m okay.
At least that means I should be
coming home soon. It’s okay. It’s
okay. Katie started drinking a few
hours ago, and you know her and
Rachel. It’s just... Anyways, it
doesn’t matter, everything is okay.
Tell me, how are things there? Did
she get her bath yet?

Katie is cooking. She loudly places a pot on the stove.
INT. RACHEL'S BEDROOM — SAME TIME
Benjy has drunk a good amount of his quarter pint bottle of
Triple Sec.
BENJY

Nothing. Just don’t want to be
dealing with your sleeping ass any
minute. Got enough to deal with
already.
32.
33.
BENJY
Please. I’m feeling nice, not going
to sleep. Definitely do not put me
with those bitches you got outside.
RACHEL
C’mon. Those are my sisters. I can
call them bitches, you can’t.
BENJY
Yeah, sure. They’re your sisters,
but you’re not theirs. Fucking
telling you to smoke outside. This
is your fucking home!
RACHEL
Shhh! Stop. For real, I don’t need
the drama.
BENJY
Okay—
RACHEL
Just lower your voice.
BENJY
Okay, okay. But you know that’s
bullshit and you don’t need to do
shit that they say, right? It’s
been you here, this whole time,
taking care of your dad. Suddenly,
it’s their place? They’ve been
doing it?! Get the fuck out of
here.
RACHEL
Quiet. For real, just shut up.
You’re yelling.
BENJY
All I’m saying is, your sister
lives where? Brooklyn? Brooklyn.
And she comes in when? Once a month
at best? Not even that. That is
some bullshit. She needs to be
called on it too. And the other
one... That one is fucking lost. I
can tell from just looking at her
that she’s not even on this planet.
RACHEL
Alright.
33.
34.
BENJY
Oh, I’m good at it. If there’s one
thing I can see is when someone is
full of shit, or out of their mind.
That ain’t you. You’re not either
of those things.
RACHEL
I know that. You’re drunk.
BENJY
And I’m reminding you of it. ‘Cause
I see you forget it. Especially
dealing with those two. They may
act like they got it, but they
don’t. Okay? You understand?
RACHEL
I got it.
She returns to the game on the TV.
RACHEL (CONT’D)
Thank you.

Christina is serving Katie and herself dinner. Another bottle
of wine has been opened, Christina’s glass is still full.
Katie is holding a pen and reading from her notepad.
KATIE
—after the Coast Guard, Vincent
took night classes in business at
B.M.C.C. where he fell in love with
the quiet green-eyed girl sitting
behind him. She became Margaret
Dyson in 1978, and they became the
loving parents to two daughters.
Margaret succumbed to breast cancer
in 1994, after a long battle, with
Vincent always by her side. Three
years later —
Rachel’s door opens and someone walks by. Katie and Christina
follow this person with their eyes. Once they hear the
bathroom door shut, Katie continues reading, quieter.

35.
KATIE (CONT’D)
—Vincent married Sarah Brodsky,
whose young daughter he raised as
his own. Sarah also preceded
Vincent in death, after her own
battle wi-
The bathroom door opens. The person crosses the opposite
direction.
KATIE (CONT’D)
You know, there’s enough food for
both of you, in case you want to
tell Rachel and join us.
BENJY (O.C.)
Ok, thanks.
KATIE
Well, nice meeting you.
Benjy is just about to open the door to Rachel’s bedroom. He
pauses. His back is to Katie and Christina for a while.
He turns to face them and his eyes are glassy from alcohol.
BENJY
Oh, we met before.
Katie watches him.
BENJY (CONT’D)
Yeah. It wasn’t even that long ago.
Maybe a few months. You don’t
remember?
KATIE
I’m not sure. No, no I don’t.
Benjy takes a couple steps closer to them at the table.
BENJY
I’m gonna guess it was the last
time you were here, maybe. Because
that was a while ago, right? It was
actually right here. In this room.
Me and Vinnie were watching a game.
Bucks Bulls. Yeah. We did that a
lot actually. We watched a lot of
games together.
KATIE
That’s nice.
35.
36.
BENJY
Sure was. He always made me feel at
home here. And I always looked
forward to seeing him. Sometimes
we’d not even say anything, just
watch. Other times we’d talk, just
bullshit, you know, talking about
life, things like that.
Katie sips her wine.
BENJY (CONT’D)
Old people... Some are like that. I
mean, not all, but I can usually
get along with them. They sometimes
got this wiseness. It’s just there
or it isn’t. That’s what I liked
about Vincent right from the jump.
The man can see people. I could
tell the moment he saw me, he
understood certain things that I’m
not going to say. I don’t need to
say. Because I’m like that too.
KATIE
Well, sounds like you both had a
good relationship. That’s great to
hear.
BENJY
I mean, I can figure out people
too. They don’t even have to say
anything, and I can get the whole
deal. Most of it at least. It’s
easy when someone is looking at me,
but really looking through me. You
understand?
KATIE
I’m not sure I’m following you. If
you’d rather not join us, I’m just
saying there is enough food for you
both. You’re welcome to take two
plates in with you too.
He comes closer to them.
BENJY
Y’see.. Y’see... Right there, I get
what you are doing. I mean, maybe
that’s obvious. But I could see it
before you even said a word, just
walking by both of you.
36.
37.
CHRISTINA
I think you are misunderstanding
things.
BENJY
Not misunderstanding shit.
Definitely not misunderstanding.
Understanding. Even the act of
offering food is ownership, you
ever think of that? I think I’ve
sat at this table more times than
the two of you combined for years.
KATIE
He’s our father.
BENJY
Yes, but who do you think has been
here? She’s not going to stick up
for herself. I mean, Rachel can
handle herself, that’s one of the
things I love about that girl, but
she doesn’t stick up for herself.
Especially around you two. Who do
you think—
KATIE
I think we got it. Thank you,
definitely heard enough.
BENJY
No, no, you did not, because just
maybe you wouldn’t be acting the
way you are, like this is your
place, like you’ve been here all
this time. Who has been taking your
old man to the bathroom? Who split
up his pills into that stupid
plastic container with the days on
it? Just the way I watched my mom
do the same thing for her father
when he was passing.
KATIE
Okay. I’m going to call her. I
think it’s time for you to step out
of our face. I can smell whatever
you’ve been drinking from here.
37.

BENJY
The fucking poor girl fed him. And
when he stopped wanting to eat
anything but apples, who was
slicing them and feeding them to
him? You don’t understand a
goddamn—
KATIE
Rachel!
The door is already open and Rachel is soon pulling Benjy
away.
KATIE (CONT’D)
Get your fucking drunk ass
boyfriend out of our faces, or
whatever the fuck he is. I don’t
want him here, he needs to go.
Benjy’s only slightly resistant.
RACHEL
Benjy. Come on. Let’s go.
He falls quiet, grabs his things, allows Rachel to walk him
towards the exit of the apartment.
BENJY
I want to say bye to Vincent.
Rachel looks behind her, at her sisters.
BENJY (CONT’D)
I’m not asking them. I want to say
bye to Vincent. Is that okay? Can I
say goodbye to him?
RACHEL
Sure, sure. Of course.
BENJY
Okay, you coming in with me?
RACHEL
I’ll stay out here.
He enters their father’s room. Rachel stands in front of the
door, waiting in the hallway. A moment later the NURSE steps
out of the room. She and Rachel look at each other.
Christina and Katie come to the other end of the hallway,
from the dining room. They too are waiting, watching.

The nurse stands between the sisters, and the four study each
other.
Benjy comes out, and quickly walks to the apartment exit
without looking back. Rachel catches up to him as he wipes
tears from his face.
Katie and Christina watch the two embrace. Christina walks
away first, Katie a moment later.
CUT TO:
INT. APARTMENT — SOON AFTER - NIGHT
The nurse is leaving.
KATIE
Thank you, thank you very much.
It’s been really helpful having you
come and watch over these hours
each day. Gives us a moment to be
out of the room at the same time.
Just catch our breath, you know.
The nurse is ready to go home.
KATIE (CONT’D)
Sometimes it gets a bit much, all
packed in together. I’m sorry about
before. Things became stressful. I
guess you’ve seen it all.
NURSE
It’s no problem. So, tomorrow, five
p.m.
KATIE
Yes, tomorrow. Unless something
happens before then. I’ll call if
so. It feels like...I don’t know.
We’ll see what tomorrow is like...
I don’t know how much longer. He’s
not doing well.
Katie has become emotional. The nurse wants to leave.
KATIE (CONT’D)
I’m sorry, I’m sorry. Just been
hard. I know you have to leave.
Really, thank you for today. See
you tomorrow, I’m sure.

Katie watches the nurse depart before pausing in front of her
father’s bedroom. Christina is inside, singing.

Not interested in whatever you want

KATIE
Well, I am trying to say—
RACHEL
Here’s the thing. We don’t need to
say anything to each other. There’s
nothing to be said, nothing I want
to hear. You do what you need to
while you are here, afterwards that
will be it. We won’t have anything
to do with each other. We can just
stay out of each others way till
then.
KATIE
That’s not very practical, nor is
that really what I think is right.
RACHEL
This isn’t about you.
KATIE
That’s right, it’s not about either
of us. It’s about our father.
RACHEL
Oh, our father? That’s funny.
KATIE
Why?
RACHEL
Because you only call him “our
father” when you want something
from me. Usually, you say “my
father”.
KATIE
Don’t be ridiculous.
Christina enters.
CHRISTINA
What’s going on here?
KATIE
Well, I was trying to apologize to
her, but—
41.
42.
RACHEL
Fuck your apology. For real.
Rachel enters her bedroom and slams its door closed.
KATIE
Nice. Nice. You slam the door when
he’s dying next door. You’re a
fucking spoiled bitch!
Katie yanks Rachel’s door open.
RACHEL
What the fuck are you doing? Are
you—
CHRISTINA
Wait. Wait! No—
Rachel grabs the door from Katie, who blocks it with a foot.
RACHEL
You have no idea. I will fucking
destroy you—
Christina gets between them.
KATIE
You’ll do what? You’ll destroy me?
You’re a fucking punk. That’s it.
You are a cheap—
RACHEL
Christina. You need to do something
about this bitch, ‘cause in about
five seconds—
KATIE
You’re not going to do shit. Bring
it on! You’re a fucking coward. A
leeching, broke ass, live at home —
Christina attempts to push Katie out of the room, but can’t
stop Katie from shoving Rachel. Rachel pushes back, and
Christina is caught between the two, bouncing back and forth
and being squeezed.
CHRISTINA
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!!
She SCREAMS. Katie and Rachel pause, confused.
42.
43.
CHRISTINA (CONT’D)
I hate you both. You’re both
fucking assholes. You’re little
fucking kids.
Christina storms off.
KATIE
Christina! Where are you going?
Christina grabs her jacket and exits the apartment.
Rachel and Katie watch her leave, then face each other, still
heated. They split apart, and Rachel shuts her bedroom door
with force. Katie spins back, ready to fight.
CUT TO:
INT. APARTMENT — SOON AFTER - LATE NIGHT
Katie is texting. A packed suitcase close by her.
Christina enters the apartment.
KATIE
Hey.
CHRISTINA
Hey.
KATIE
I just left his room to pack. He’s
doing ok.
CHRISTINA
Why did you pack?
KATIE
I think I should head home for a
bit.
CHRISTINA
It’s late.
KATIE
It will be fine. I think it would
do good if I leave. If something
changes, just let me know and I’ll
come back.
CHRISTINA
Something is going to change. You
know that.
43.
44.
Katie takes a moment.
KATIE
Christina, I don’t know what you
want of me. Clearly there is an
issue with the three of us. I
didn’t even know it was between us.
Regardless, she lives here, you
live far away, it makes sense for
me to be the one to step out for a
while.
Christina shakes her head.
CHRISTINA
He is going to die, and you will
not be here. And you will never
forgive me. I am sorry. I don’t
want you to leave. I want you to
stay. I want the three of us to
figure something out. Some way,
that we can do what we can to get
along. At least for now.
KATIE
I thought we were just fine. You
and I. That was a surprise.
CHRISTINA
Katie. I was mad. I got angry.
Allow me to say things. I was
scared.
The sisters look at each other.
CHRISTINA (CONT’D)
Let’s sit down. All three of us. We
can leave the door open, we will
hear if something is happening.
KATIE
I don’t know.
Christina waits.
KATIE (CONT’D)
You know he’s going to die while we
are talking.
44.
(MORE)
45.
CHRISTINA
I don’t think so. Especially if he
can hear that we’re all talking,
together.
CUT TO:
INT. APARTMENT — NIGHT
The father’s door is open. Beeping sounds fill the hall. The
oxygen machine rises and falls with each breath.
Katie sits in a chair. Christina in another. Rachel’s space
is empty.
They wait.
KATIE
I don’t think she’s going to join.
Christina does.
Rachel’s door opens. She pauses at the sight of her sisters.
She is still angry.
CHRISTINA
Hey.
RACHEL
Hey.
Rachel and Katie don’t look at each other.
CHRISTINA
Katie has been working on dad’s
obituary.
RACHEL
Okay.
CHRISTINA
She was reading it to me earlier.
Silence follows. Christina presses on.
CHRISTINA (CONT’D)
And hearing what she wrote, it made
me think that we each have very
different stories. Who he is, who
he was, to each of us. We were all
raised by him, but at different
times. We had different lives, even
if it was in the same home.
(MORE)
45.
CHRISTINA (CONT’D)
46.
I mean, both of you had moved out
before I was even a teenager. It
makes sense that we are different.
Christina takes the silence as a reason to continue.
CHRISTINA (CONT’D)
I’m sorry for what I said earlier.
I don’t hate either of you. I don’t
think you are both assholes. I was
mad, I was scared. It’s everything
I did not want to happen. I
apologize.
RACHEL
Shit. Whatever. That wasn’t the
problem. I mean, it’s all good. No
need to apologize, but apology
accepted.
Silence.
KATIE
Yeah, it’s fine, Christina. Apology
accepted. Of course. I apologize
you got caught between things.
More silence. Rachel fidgets, on the verge of leaving.
Christina is not content with her sisters’ responses.
CHRISTINA
Well, I—
KATIE
I was trying to say sorry too.
Earlier. Before things went out of
hand.
RACHEL
Yeah, sorry for what?
KATIE
For one thing, criticizing you
about the apples being in there. I
hadn’t known they were for dad. I’m
sorry, I wish I did.
RACHEL
And that makes all the difference?
The apples tells you all you need
to know?
CHRISTINA (CONT’D)
46.
47.
KATIE
It was one thing. It was a thing,
that I assumed incorrectly.
RACHEL
Anything else?
KATIE
Sure.
Rachel waits.
KATIE (CONT’D)
From the beginning I’ve understood
I was in your place.
RACHEL
That’s bullshit. This is your place
too. You know it, I know it.
KATIE
But you live here. You are on the
lease.
RACHEL
That’s the second time you
mentioned this lease shit. What is
that? What are you trying to say?
She looks at Christina.
RACHEL (CONT’D)
And you brought it up too. Outside.
What’s up with this?
KATIE
Nothing. Just the facts. When he
dies, this becomes your place.
RACHEL
Do you think that’s what I want?
That I give a shit about the place?
CHRISTINA
Let’s keep our voices down, we need
to be able to hear his room. I
don’t believe we were trying to
imply anything other than what’s
understood.
RACHEL
Understood?
47.
48.
KATIE
C’mon, Rachel, of course you care
about him. But this place is a good
deal, let’s be truthful about it.
No one has rent like this in this
city. I mean just about. It doesn’t
exist. This is good, I’m happy for
you. I want you to have it.
RACHEL
Well then fuck it. I don’t want it.
Now what?
KATIE
Don’t be silly. Why would you
leave?
RACHEL
Because then we are done with each
other, and this shit is a wrap.
KATIE
This doesn’t make any sense.
Christina, can you explain what
this is all about?
CHRISTINA
I’m not sur-
RACHEL
Don’t play fucking dumb.
KATIE
Fuck you-
CHRISTINA
Hey. Hey. Everyone stop.
They do what she says.
In the quiet, they listen to the beeping. It’s steady,
everything sounds fine. Christina gets up and goes to the
room to make sure.
She returns to her seat.
CHRISTINA (CONT’D)
Everything is okay.
After more silence.
CHRISTINA (CONT’D)
I think, what Rachel is asking, is
what connects us, after he’s gone?
48.
49.
RACHEL
Not us. You two is clear. And I get
it with you, Christina. You live
thousands of miles away. You got a
kid, probably gonna pop out a bunch
more. You got your life. This city
ain’t your thing, I get it.
CHRISTINA
So you only care about your
relationship with Katie?
RACHEL
Oh, fuck no. You, at least, act
like we have something more in
common.
CHRISTINA
See, see, this is what I was trying
to say. We each have our story, but
we don’t know the others. We assume
we do, but maybe, just maybe before
I “pop” out some more kids —which
is fucking disgusting by the way—
RACHEL
It’s true!
CHRISTINA
Nothing pops. There is no popping.
That’s not the way it is.
RACHEL
Okay, whatever. Looks like popping
to me.
CHRISTINA
—before I choose to grow my
family...if I choose to...there are
things that I was hoping to do.
RACHEL
Yeah, like what? What do you
possibly need to do? Your life is
perfect, I know it, everyone knows
it, you let everyone know.
CHRISTINA
Is that what you think? Is that
what you think I’m saying when I
show pictures of Mirabella or talk
about my life?
Christina looks to Katie, who doesn’t respond how she hopes.
49.
50.
CHRISTINA (CONT’D)
Katie? Is that what it comes off
as, to you?
Katie clears her throat.
CHRISTINA (CONT’D)
Well. Damnit. For real. Damnit.
That’s not at all what I’ve
meant... That’s not what...
RACHEL
I’m sorry. Look, I really didn’t
mean to say anything to hurt you. I
thought it was kinda obvious. I
mean, I never hear you complain
about anything. I guess Mirabella
won’t eat green vegetables? But
hey, maybe that’s just me. Forget
what I said. What was it you’re
hoping to do, before having more
kids?
CHRISTINA
I was. I was hoping. I was hoping
to...form a relationship with you
for one thing.
RACHEL
Ah, Christina. That’s sweet. Nah,
that is. But, I kinda thought we
had a relationship...
CHRISTINA
No, a real one.
RACHEL
...and it is what it is. Look,
let’s just forget it. We’re just
different types of people. You and
Katie, I mean, you both share
blood. You have the same mother.
KATIE
And father.
RACHEL
Well, duh. I know that. But he’s my
dad too. That’s what I’m saying.
Katie doesn’t say anything.
50.
51.
RACHEL (CONT’D)
He’s my dad too. Just as much as he
is both of yours.
KATIE
But you also had another dad.
RACHEL
Who I never fucking knew. Who died
when I was four fucking years old.
KATIE
But he was still your father. And
when he was, Vincent was ours.
RACHEL
Okay, here it is. This is what this
is all about. I. Did. Not. Have. A.
Father. Before him. What part of
that do you not understand? He’s
been daddy to me. That’s my dad,
over there. In here. Fucking dying.
That is my dad. That’s my dad.
KATIE
I know, I know. I’m not saying he’s
not.
Katie is about to continue when Christina puts up a hand.
The sound of the beeping. Steady. The machine rising and
falling with each breath.
CHRISTINA
Just because I don’t complain,
doesn’t mean I don’t have issues.
Rachel gets out of her chair.
RACHEL
I’ve been here for him, not for
this stupid place.
Rachel goes to her room. Katie looks to Christina to
commiserate, but she won’t.
Christina gets up and goes to her room.
Katie is left alone.
CUT TO:
51.
52.
INT. APARTMENT — EARLY MORNING
Christina has found a corner for her yoga mat.
Katie, coming from their father’s room, enters holding a mug.
KATIE
I think I actually found someone to
come over. A doctor. To get that
form signed.
CHRISTINA
That’s good.
KATIE
I’m sorry, you’re stretching.
CHRISTINA
No, it’s fine. I was finishing.
KATIE
Do you want some coffee?
CHRISTINA
Sure.
Katie returns from the kitchen with second cup.
KATIE
The thing is getting dad to appear
with it, when the doctor’s here.
CHRISTINA
Yeah, that may be tricky. He really
didn’t say anything to me last
night. Mumbled a few times, but
nothing I understood.
KATIE
Same. Do you think it would be
wrong to give him coffee? Ok, maybe
not. We just need one more window
of clarity. That’s it. One last
one. I know he has it in him.
CHRISTINA
The coffee is good, thank you.
The two drink.
KATIE
I’m sorry about last night. It got
out of hand.
52.
53.
CHRISTINA
Me too.
Silence.
CHRISTINA (CONT’D)
There’s something I realized
yesterday. After we all spoke
together. It’s silly. I mean, it’s
obvious, I should have realized it
years ago, but didn’t. For whatever
reason.
It’s an overcast day outside.
CHRISTINA (CONT’D)
Her mother died. And so did ours.
Christina takes a moment.
CHRISTINA (CONT’D)
It’s something else we have in
common. Besides dad. We never
talked about it, when it happened
to her. I mean, I didn’t.
KATIE
You were young.
CHRISTINA
We all were. Probably too young to
talk about it, in any real way.
CUT TO:
INT. APARTMENT — BEDROOM/STORAGE — MORNING
Katie peeks in, and speaks in their childhood secret
language:
KATIE
The doitug—ctor is heitug—re, can
you see whitug—at yitherg—ou
citherg—an do to githerg—et
ditherg—ad awitug—ake whitug—ile I

Christina puts down the box of storage she was looking
through, and heads towards their father’s room.
53.
(MORE)
54.
KATIE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
How about some coffee, just made
more. No? We have water and juice
as well. Means a lot that you came,
I can’t tell you how difficult it
was to find someone. Busy, busy
city. House calls thing of the past
I guess, right?
EXT. RACHEL'S BEDROOM — SAME TIME - MORNING
Rachel has her door cracked open, but doesn’t step out till
she hears Katie and the doctor join her sister in their
father’s room.
KATIE (O.S.)
Dad. Dad! How are you doing?
INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER
Rachel finds an apple deep in the back of the fridge.
INT. APARTMENT - DINING ROOM AREA - MOMENTS LATER
In the dining room, Rachel finds the notepad that Katie has
been writing their father’s obituary in, and reads it.
CUT TO:
INT. APARTMENT — LIVING ROOM AREA — SOON AFTER/MORNING
Katie is on the phone.
KATIE
Well, that was nothing to get
worked up about. He basically just
needed a pulse, the doctor could
care less. Five hundred and fifty
dollars, in and out ten minutes.
Must be a nice life. But, yeah, at
least it’s done.
She suddenly becomes upset by what she is hearing.
KATIE (CONT’D)
Well, tell her she has to. It’s not
something up for debate. This can’t
be this thing where I’m the bad
person. I’m the mean mother. Things
are hard enough here.
(MORE)
54.
KATIE (CONT’D)
55.
I’m like that here. I don’t get it.
I don’t understand how I became
that person to everyone. It’s not
fair, it’s not who I am. No one
gives me space to be anything else.
Katie spots Rachel outside through the window, way down below
on the sidewalk. She’s excitedly petting someones dog.
KATIE (CONT’D)
Nothing, forget it, okay. Let Tracy
do whatever she wants. It’s out of
my hands. Let’s talk later.
Katie hangs up, remains by the window, and watches Rachel.
EXT. APARTMENT — SAME TIME - MORNING
The dog Rachel is playing with is huge.
RACHEL
Oh he loves me. I love you too
little doggy. You’re just a great
little big beast. Fucking
slobbering little cute thing. Damn,
that’s a good dog you got. Eats
like a horse, I bet.
JUMP CUT TO:
INT. SMOKE SHOP — MOMENTS LATER
RACHEL
That’s right. You got it.
The clerk is handing her blunt paper.
RACHEL (CONT’D)
You should open earlier, you know
that? What is this ten a.m.
bullshit? I swear, this
neighborhood is going to shit. I
should open up my own blunt store,
24 hours, no bullshit, just here’s
your shit and get the fuck out of
here. Fucking wholesale. Ha, just
play—
JUMP CUT TO:
KATIE (CONT’D)

INT. APARTMENT — LATE MORNING
Rachel is entering her bedroom.
KATIE
Rachel!
She finds her sisters sitting with Angel. They wave her over.
ANGEL
Morning.
RACHEL
Hello.
ANGEL
How you doing?
Rachel nods.
RACHEL
Can’t complain.
ANGEL
That’s good, that’s good. I just
came out from seeing your father.
You were able to get that DNR form
signed, I see.
KATIE
Yes. Yes. A doctor came this
morning.
ANGEL
And he was able to sign? I mean he
was aware of what’s going on?
KATIE
Yes.
ANGEL
That’s. That’s a surprise. I mean,
that’s good. But what I was just
about to say to your sisters, is —I
know this is hard to hear— but I’d
be very surprised if your father is
conscious again. Thankfully...he
appears to be comfortable.
Angel pauses for any questions.
56.
57.
ANGEL (CONT’D)
In terms of what happens after,
both Mirabella and I will be here
as soon as we possibly can, and
handle as much as we can. There are
certain things that we won’t be
able to answer though. Exactly when
you realize he’s passed. If you
could try to note it. And of
course, you know, it does not need
to be to the second. We understand
that. Pick a minute in the time
frame, once you are able. Maybe
decide between the three of you who
will do what, who will make calls,
who will document. You will need
each other. It’s good that there is
three of you.
KATIE
I feel like you are saying this is
it. Like we are here now. At the
end.
RACHEL
Wasn’t that yesterday? I mean, no
offense, but for real, we know he’s
dying. Like, we get it. You say you
can’t say when, but then come here
and tell us this is it every day.
I’m not speaking for them, but it’s
kind of wearing on me, y’know?
KATIE
It’s a lot. It’s been a lot of
“time to say goodbye”.
RACHEL
It was definitely yesterday.
KATIE
And today.
Rachel and Katie’s eyes connect with mutual amusement.
ANGEL
I’m sorry if I’ve come off as
alarmist. That’s definitely not my
intention. It’s just, that, things
have been ending. That’s why I am
here.
57.
58.
CHRISTINA
We know. You’ve been great. Trust
me, we are grateful. It was a late
night.
JUMP CUT TO:
INT. APARTMENT — SOON AFTER
Christina walks Angel to the door, Katie and Rachel remain at
the dinner table.
RACHEL
I couldn’t help it. The dude is
here every day saying he’s going to
die. Bad enough as it is, but he’s
dramatic as fuck.
KATIE
I know, I know.
RACHEL
I’m high, so what do I know?
KATIE
I don’t know. I’m just tired. But
it’s true.
RACHEL
Good morning, your dad’s dying, may
I have some coffee?
Katie laughs.
CHRISTINA (O.C.)
What’s wrong with you two?
Christina, having just entered the room, stops at the
doorway.
RACHEL
I’m sorry. I should keep my mouth
closed.
CHRISTINA
No, you’re right. He should switch
it up, just for a bit. Say he
should be juggling soon just to see
if we are listening.
RACHEL
Juggling?
58.
59.
CHRISTINA
Something random. Anything.
RACHEL
Juggling?! Why juggling? Dad
doesn’t know how to juggle.
KATIE
He could do that thing where the
quarter disappears.
RACHEL
Oh yeah.
CHRISTINA
Okay, so—
RACHEL
Yeah. Your dad should be
disappearing a quarter anytime
soon. I like that. That makes sense
to me.
KATIE
You’re stoned. But yeah. I agree.
CHRISTINA
Are you going to go in there?
Rachel sobers suddenly.
CHRISTINA (CONT’D)
If you want. I’m not pushing you.
But if you want, and want to be
there with us, or without us, I
hope you’ll say.
Rachel doesn’t respond.
CHRISTINA (CONT’D)
Well, I’m going in there. I’ll call
if anything happens. If a quarter
begins to disappear.
Christina leaves, Rachel and Katie remain seated.
KATIE
I’m not planning on our
relationship just ending when he’s
gone.
RACHEL
Yeah, what relationship is that?
59.
60.
KATIE
Well. What do you want it to be?
Rachel forces a laugh.
CUT TO:
INT. APARTMENT — LIVING ROOM AREA — AFTERNOON
Katie sits at the couch, furiously texting. Eventually she
calls, gets voicemail.
KATIE
No, you pick up the phone. Tracy-
She hangs up and returns to texting. Her phone rings.
KATIE (CONT’D)
I don’t care that you are at lunch,
if you don’t want to talk before
school, this is what happens.
Tracy, Tracy, listen to me. I need
you to stop, and hear me...
From Rachel’s room is the sound of the TV.
INT. RACHEL'S BEDROOM — SAME TIME
Rachel is casually watching a game on her television.
A broken plate is on the floor near her. Whether it happened
recently, or last night during the scuffle, is unclear.
JUMP CUT TO:
INT. APARTMENT — SOON AFTER
Rachel exits her bedroom. Katie hears, and turns away.
KATIE
-do not do that. Tracy, I am asking
you to not-
Rachel stops in front of her father’s bedroom. She can hear
Christina reading inside.
KATIE (CONT’D)
Trac-
Tracy has hung up on her. Katie furious, calls back.
60.
61.
The sound of Rachel leaving the apartment causes Katie to
stop what she is doing, and give up.
CUT TO:
INT. KITCHEN — SOON AFTER
Katie sweeps up a mug that has just broken. Christina is
behind her, digging through the fridge.
KATIE
Are you sure you don’t want half,
at least?
CHRISTINA
No, I’m really not hungry.
She pulls out some juice from the fridge. A copy of the “Do
Not Resuscitate” form has been taped to its door.
Christina pours herself a glass.
KATIE
I know it’s weird, but it says to
do that.
CHRISTINA
It’s fine.
KATIE
Really, I can’t make you anything?
I’m hungry all the time here.
CHRISTINA
Truly. Maybe later.
KATIE
Do you want a break? I can go in
and sit with him, if you’d like.
CHRISTINA
I’m fine. Do you want to be in
there? Of course, we can be there
together. It’s fine. I’m just
reading to him.
KATIE
No, no. You stay. There’s things I
can do. Do you know where Rachel
went to?
Christina fills her glass with water and shakes her head no.
61.
62.
INT. APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
Christina walks to her father’s room. But, instead of
entering, she continues to the opposite end of the apartment.
She takes a seat in a chair, out of Katie’s view.
KATIE (O.C.)
Christina?
Katie can be heard knocking quietly on their father’s door
before opening it. Christina gets out of her seat.
CHRISTINA
Hey.
KATIE
Oh. Oh, you’re over there.
CHRISTINA
Yes, just on my way. Was taking a
moment. What’s up?
KATIE
Nothing. Take the moment.
Everything is fine.
Christina sits down.
Katie unsurely lingers. Then leaves.
Rachel enters the apartment carrying a plastic bag. She
immediately spots Christina.
RACHEL
He’s gone?
Christina stands up.
CHRISTINA
No, not at all. We would have
called you if something like that
happened.
RACHEL
I don’t know. It’s just weird, you
sitting there.
CHRISTINA
Katie’s making food. If you want.
RACHEL
Yeah. Shit feels pretty weird in
here.
62.
63.
CHRISTINA
Just hanging out for a moment
before going back to dad.
RACHEL
Okay. I need to go check scores. I
placed a six-team parlay. Shit
ain’t gonna hit, but who knows.
Rachel starts to leave.
RACHEL (CONT’D)
You okay?
CHRISTINA
I’m fine.
RACHEL
Okay. Here. Here, take this.
Rachel hands her an ice tea from the bag she holds, then
walks quickly away. It was the only thing in it.
CHRISTINA
Thank you.
RACHEL (O.C.)
Yup. No worries.
INT. APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
Rachel pauses in front of her father’s room. She looks down
both ends of the hallway, no one is watching.
She pushes the door open just enough to look in.
RACHEL
Hey Poppa.
She knows he won’t answer, but waits regardless.
RACHEL (CONT’D)
We have the Clippers at +125, Bills
-200, Titans -145, Vikings -900,
Mets -115, and, uh, Eagles -220.
Twenty to win seven twenty four and
some change. Crazy, right?
She gently closes the door before continuing on to her room.

Katie is greeting the nurse.
KATIE
Good to see you, come in, come in.
The nurse does.
NURSE
How is he? How is your father?
Katie nods.
KATIE
He’s... He’s hanging in there!
Still with us.
They walk to his door.
KATIE (CONT’D)
Can I get you some food? I made
soup. No? How about some coffee?
Okay. Well, just let me know if you
change your mind. I made way too
much.

Christina is on the phone.
CHRISTINA
You’re going in the bath. How fun!
Yes, with ducky. Who else?
Bubbles?! What a good daddy. Splash
some water for me too, okay?
She takes a seat as her husband gets on the phone.
CHRISTINA (CONT’D)
Hey... Hey! You’re in the middle of
things. Of course, just call me
when you get a minute. Nothing.
Nothing. Everything is fine. Just
want to say hi. Just homesick. Will
do, thanks. Yes. Love you too. Talk
then.
Christina hangs up, remains seated. She looks at her phone,
scrolls, presses a button:

How you doing Rachel?
RACHEL
Doing okay.
VICTOR (O.S.)
How’s your dad doing?
She exhales smoke for a long time.
RACHEL
Hanging in. Still here.
VICTOR (O.S.)
That’s good.
RACHEL
Yup. Thanks.
VICTOR (O.S.)
You know what I’m supposed to be
telling you, right? About smoking
out here? Let’s just say that I
did, okay?
RACHEL
Yup, yup. Thanks.
Victor leaves and Rachel continues to smoke in peace.

Christina is stretching on her yoga mat.
Katie is at the dinner table, notepad and pen in hand.
KATIE
How many times a day do you do
that?

66.
CHRISTINA
Just when I can. I usually don’t
have the time. But it helps. Want
to join me?
KATIE
Thanks. Maybe I’ll start when the
kids are older. Out of the house.
I’m struggling with writing this.
CHRISTINA
I think you should ask Rachel.
KATIE
Really?
Christina doesn’t answer. Katie goes to Rachel’s room,
knocks.
Rachel opens the door.
KATIE (CONT’D)
Are you busy?
Rachel waits for her to continue.
KATIE (CONT’D)
I’m trying to write this thing. His
obituary, and was hoping you could
help with it.
RACHEL
I don’t really know anything about
writing those things.
KATIE
Me neither.

...Vincent was proud to work for
The Department of Citywide
Administrative Services. After
thirty-two years, he retired as a
senior supervisor, beloved by his
colleagues. Vincent will be
remembered for his dedication to
his family and friends, his
welcoming spirit, warm wit, and an
unwavering love for the Jets.

She looks up at Rachel, who sits across from her at the
table. In the far corner —the living room area— Christina
lays on her yoga mat in a baby pose.
RACHEL
That’s it?
KATIE
So far. And I know it all sounds
so...dry. But I’m not sure how to
sum up his life in just a few
words.
RACHEL
Seems like a pretty good job so
far. I’m not sure who reads those
things anyway. I don’t. If you knew
the person, you knew the person.
KATIE
It’s more a record. Just to have.
Like saying “this person existed”,
in case anyone wants to know.
RACHEL
I’m gonna put my money that you
could write anything and no one’s
going to notice.
Christina rolls up her mat and goes to get a glass of water.
RACHEL (CONT’D)
Married a couple crazy bitches,
raised a few crazy bitches.
KATIE
Thanks.
RACHEL
Ok, serious. Let’s see...
Vincent... Vincent loves the Jets.
KATIE
Yeah. Got that.
RACHEL
He loves to laugh at stupid shit.
He likes old movies. He listens to
records. He’d call in on news radio
sometimes and get into it. He can
get crazy mad, start yelling about
things, then forget about what.

RACHEL (CONT’D)

He doesn’t give a fuck about a lot
of things you shouldn’t give a fuck
about.
Katie finishes writing down her words. Christina enters from
the kitchen, and stands nearby, finishing her glass of water.
KATIE
...”doesn’t give a fuck about a lot
of things you shouldn’t”... Well,
that’s true.
RACHEL
Everything I just said was true.
KATIE
I know. And it’s more interesting
than what I wrote, but in the end,
it’s a list too.
RACHEL
I tried.
CHRISTINA
One day, this is after Sarah
passed, and Katie, you just left
for college, or it was the summer
before, but you weren’t in the
city, and Rachel, you were spending
a lot of nights out, so it wasn’t
that uncommon that dad and I found
each other in the home alone
together at night. I didn’t need
much help with school work, and you
know, he was still mourning, but
we’d watch a film together
sometimes after dinner. Or a TV
show. This is a time I still think
about a lot. It was...calm. Well,
one night, he got really upset by
what we were watching. I don’t know
what it was other than someone was
dying in it. He wanted to explain
to me that the death we were
watching in the film had no
relationship to how it really was
in life. How movies and books and
everything else that tried to show
death, got it wrong. That the act
itself, of putting it into words,
into images, is where it all went
wrong. A big lie, like the thing we
were watching.
RACHEL (CONT’D)
(MORE)
68.
CHRISTINA (CONT’D)
(MORE)
69.
That...that—if I can remember—the
only way to sum up a person’s life,
the only way to put things in
perspective, what they did, who
they were, how they loved and were
loved was—
The nurse enters the room suddenly. All three sisters jump.
KATIE
What’s wrong?!
The nurse is startled.
NURSE
No, no. He is sleeping. It is just
time for me to leave.
It takes a moment for the sisters to relax.
The nurse leaves to gather her things.
RACHEL
That was crazy. I was sure
something happened.
KATIE
Me too. This is crazy. I mean, we
are all just on edge. It feels so
wrong.
CHRISTINA
I’ll go see her off.
RACHEL
No, wait a sec. You can’t leave us
just like that. You were about to
say what dad said, about dying.
CHRISTINA
Oh. Just, the only way to
communicate how death truly feels,
is through absence. Everything else
is fantasy.
Christina leaves, Rachel and Katie remain.
RACHEL
So, basically don’t write anything.
KATIE
I think what he was saying is, we
won’t really know who he was till
after.
CHRISTINA (CONT’D)
(MORE)

KATIE (CONT’D)
70.
But, I think I know who people are
when they are still living, right?
RACHEL
Yeah, kinda.
Katie doesn’t understand.
RACHEL (CONT’D)
Well, like who they are right now.
It’s not my business, but I hear
you and Tracy going at it. But
that’s just who she is right now,
as a teenager. You know that. I
think Pops was talking the whole
thing, like all of it. All the
different times, different people
we can be. Y’know, for it all.
KATIE
Yeah. That’s easy to forget. With
Tracy. It feels like she will be
like this forever.
She has been clearly softened by Rachel’s words.
RACHEL
I mean, she may be still spoiled
when she gets older, but you know,
a different spoiled.
Rachel smiles.
RACHEL (CONT’D)
I’m just playing.
KATIE
Yes. I know.
Katie puts her pen down.
KATIE (CONT’D)
I’m sorry I wasn’t here more. To
help you. I know it was a lot.
RACHEL
It was fine. I liked it. But
thanks.
KATIE
And I hope you don’t leave this
place.

Christina stands nearby, listening.
INT. APARTMENT - DINING AREA — CONTINUOUS
RACHEL
Why?
Christina enters the room.
KATIE
Because I want to keep the
apartment in the family.
Rachel studies Katie, then Christina.
CHRISTINA
Do you want to go in there?
Together? Right now?
Rachel stays still.
CHRISTINA (CONT’D)
It’s okay. Let’s do it.
She puts a hand out towards Rachel.
CUT TO:
INT. APARTMENT — HALLWAY — SOON AFTER/NIGHT
The house is still. The father’s door is cracked open. Beeps
and the sound of assisted breathing echo.
Whispering. Some laughter.
RACHEL (O.S.)
Aw daddy. It’s me.
A kiss.
The sound of rustling.
Mumbling.
KATIE (O.S.)
What’s that? Dad? I don’t
understand. You want me to move
you? Please say it again.
71.
72.
CHRISTINA (O.S.)
I can...you...ok, hold up—
RACHEL (O.S.)
I think dad wants to sit up.
More mumbling.
KATIE (O.S.)
Really? Are you sure?
RACHEL (O.S.)
I’ll get it.
Rachel rushes out of the bedroom towards the apartment door.
KATIE (O.S.)
Are you sure dad? Christina, grab
his waist. I think if we can get
him in the chair, we can move
everything together.
Rachel returns carrying a folded wheelchair.
CUT TO:
INT. APARTMENT — SOON AFTER
With each sister giving directions, the family emerges into
the living room. Christina leads the way, rolling the
breathing machine forward, which is attached to their father
VINCENT, who follows in his wheelchair, which Rachel pushes.
Katie trails with the heart monitor, also still attached.
Vincent makes a motion.
CHRISTINA
I think he wants to sit in his
chair?
KATIE
In? Is that wise? What if we need
to move him suddenly?
CHRISTINA
To what?
With a lot of coordination, they get their father into his
chair while still connected to his machines.
Vincent attempts to say something.
72.
73.
KATIE
What’s that, dad?
She leans in.
KATIE (CONT’D)
I don’t understand. Someone else
try.
RACHEL
What’s up, Pops? It sure is good to
see you back in your chair.
He mumbles a response.
RACHEL (CONT’D)
Pillow? I think—he wants his pillow
for his back. It’s in my room. On
my bed, against the wall.
Christina trades looks with Katie before retrieving it.
RACHEL (CONT’D)
Here you go daddy. Look at you.
Back in charge. Just like that.
Knew you weren’t down yet.
KATIE
What do we do? I don’t think he’s
supposed to eat anything.
CHRISTINA
He’s not asking for food. I don’t
think so, at least.
RACHEL
We just hang out with him. We could
watch a movie, or a game, if he
wants. Dad, Titans blew our parlay,
but we can still catch the Bills if
you want.
Katie takes pictures with her phone. Christina places a
blanket on Vincent’s lap and buttons his pajamas. One button
drops into her palm. She studies it curiously.
Vincent studies his daughters as they kiss his cheek, his
forehead, his hand. It quickly becomes overwhelming.
VINCENT
Everyone...
The three sisters freeze.
73.
74.
VINCENT (CONT’D)
Please. Just...
They are stunned.
VINCENT (CONT’D)
I’m fine. Everyone. Please. Stop.
This is more coherence than they have heard for a while.
VINCENT (CONT’D)
I...this machine...these
machines...the sound...
Vincent YANKS the breathing tube out of his nostril.
KATIE
Wait! You can’t—!
He has.
VINCENT
Off! Off!
Vincent SHOVES the machine onto to the ground and it stops
working. Next, he pulls out the morphine drip from his arm,
and pushes the machine over as well.
All three daughters cry out in shock.
No more beeping, no more machines.
VINCENT (CONT’D)
Ahh..
Vincent relaxes.
VINCENT (CONT’D)
For fuck’s sake.
His speaking is still labored, but he’s gaining strength.
RACHEL
Dad...
He moves to get out of his chair.
CHRISTINA
Wait, dad. I don’t think...
With trembling arms, Vincent lifts himself out of the chair.
They all attempt to help him.
74.
75.
VINCENT
No! No, let me do it. I
still...have...more left...in me.
He’s on his feet. It takes a moment before he gets his
balance, and Katie reaches out again. He waves her hand away.
VINCENT (CONT’D)
Just give me a minute.
He takes a step, then turns back to face his daughters.
He takes another step, now more confident.
Vincent disappears into the kitchen.
VINCENT (O.C.) (CONT’D)
“Do Not Resuscitate”. Nice.
Sound of the fridge being opened, a bottle cap popped.
Vincent emerges with a beer in his hand.
CHRISTINA
Dad...
VINCENT
Ok, enough with the shocked looks.
I’ve been in bed for how long now?
Vincent walks to the table, sees the notepad with the draft
of his obituary.
VINCENT (CONT’D)
Katie. I mean, it’s nice, and I
thank you for trying, but first
off—
He scratches something off.
VINCENT (CONT’D)
Rachel is your sister. She is my
daughter. I didn’t raise her “like
my own”. She is my own. If blood
had an influence on us, you would
have had a very different father.
You would have had a dad like my
dad. My dad was a fucking jerk, you
know that. We were related, but he
was no father.
Vincent looks at Katie.
75.
76.
VINCENT (CONT’D)
You have no idea how much Rachel
cares about you, how much you mean
to her. When you moved out, and
went to college, I’ve never seen
her so sad. Well, only when her
mother was sick and left us. I kept
waiting for the day for you both to
realize why you fight so much. How
similar you are.
Vincent looks out a window, onto the city.
VINCENT (CONT’D)
I want you all to try, when I’m
gone. I know that a better
relationship is possible. You will
be connected after I’m gone. Even
more so, because of it. I just know
it.
He faces his daughters.
VINCENT (CONT’D)
Christina. Christina. I know you
didn’t have it right. I heard what
you said about that time, when we’d
watch movies together. But that was
the only time. I never gave it to
you, and no one else really did
either. I can’t tell you how sorry
I am. You just...you just...from
the moment you could walk didn’t
seem to need anyone. That you were
fine, and could be left alone. And
then, when your mother passed, you
seemed okay, too. I should have
realized that’s not possible, that
you were hurting just as much, but
I was in so much pain I couldn’t
see. And then, I fell in love
again, and then... That girl of
yours will not be left wanting. I
watch you with that love of yours
for her, for David, for whoever is
going to join you next if you
choose to have more, and I thank
you. I thank you for doing better
than me. For doing more.
Vincent turns back to the window.

VINCENT (CONT’D)
Damn, I love this city. I marvel at
it. Like the roaches and the weeds,
somehow, we keep making it through.
I sure will miss the ghosts and
memories I have on every block. I
guess I'll be one soon enough.
Vincent picks up a quarter.
VINCENT (CONT’D)
A couple last things before I make
this disappear. And by the way, I
can juggle, or I could, a bit when
I was young. I think so, at least.
He is now light on his toes, like a dancer.
VINCENT (CONT’D)
There was one other real, true love
besides your mothers. This love
happened when I was very young, the
summer I went into the Coast Guard.
Her name was Bliss. I know, but
it’s not so uncommon in Ireland,
and she was Irish, from Queens. And
like all of you, like your mothers,
she could handle herself. But I’d
never met anyone like Bliss before.
She was interested in more things
than anyone I had ever met till
then. Maybe since then. She found
life, the world, people
interesting, and it was
intoxicating to be around. I
couldn’t get enough. I wanted to
see like her. I aimed to see like
her. And then I went away, and by
the time I got out, our letters had
stopped, and the way life can,
things just drifted apart. In fact,
we didn’t see or run into each
other again except for one time,
each in our own group, passing each
other on the street. It was so
brief, and when I grabbed her arm
and said hello, she said “You still
remember me!” I said “Yes, of
course, you changed my life.” That
made her smile. But if there was
any guilt I have, it’s that maybe I
could have expressed myself better.

VINCENT (CONT’D)
78.
There’s no big lesson here, we know
we each will die with at least one
regret. It’s just a love, that I
want you to know about. Something
that fundamentally changed me. Made
me who I am, who I...
Vincent sees something that makes him stop mid-sentence.
VINCENT (CONT’D)
...who I...
Vincent is staring at-
CUT TO:
himself, in his chair, plugged into his medical equipment.
Every word spoken, every step taken, has been a fantasy of
his.
His breathing has just stopped. The beeps flatline.
His three daughters cry out before him.
KATIE
Dad!
RACHEL
Daddy!
CHRISTINA
Dad!
JUMP CUT TO:
INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT
Vincent’s chair is empty.
The sisters sit on the sofa across from it, close together.
With no more beeping, the house has never been so quiet.
People have come and gone. Paperwork is on the table.
Vincent’s body has been taken away.
Christina stands up and approaches the chair, her sisters
watching. She feels the grooves in the arm rests, then takes
a seat in it.
From here, Christina sees the love her sisters look at her
with.
VINCENT (CONT’D)
78.
79.
She gets out of the chair and returns to them.
Katie stands up. Takes the seat. Gets up out of it,
hesitates, and sits back down.
KATIE
Dad is gone.
Katie takes her place on the sofa. They wait for Rachel.
Finally, Rachel takes her turn in the chair.
She returns to her sisters just as quickly. The three study
the chair as if it may come to life itself.
Christina grabs Katie’s arm and Rachel’s hand.
They are intertwined. The chair stares back.

Katie places food into plastic containers, then into the

She tears the “DNR” form off the refrigerator’s door.
Katie, suitcase by her side, is texting on her phone.
Katie hugs Rachel. She then puts on her sunglasses before
