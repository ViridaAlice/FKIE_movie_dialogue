QUEER
Screenplay by
Justin Kuritzkes
Based on the novel by
William S. Burroughs
INT. LOLA’S CANTINA, MEXICO CITY, 1950 - DAY
LEE
You’re not queer.
WILLIAM LEE, late 40s, gaunt, American, sweating through his
oversized white oxford with a glass of tequila in front of
him, looks into the camera as if studying a face. His gaze is
piercing, scrutinizing: familiar and yet restless, intense.
He stares for a long beat, taking in every feature.
We reverse and see: CARL STEINBERG -- blond, thin-faced,
freckly, clean-looking: a bird-like German-American Jewish
young man looking right back at Lee. Behind him, we see that
the cantina is just finishing lunch service: two locals dance
near the jukebox, drinking.
Carl shifts uncomfortably and laughs, not sure what to say.
LEE (CONT’D)
Usually, if I get this far with an
American kid, I can get the rest of
the way, but with you, there’s
some... obstacle.
Carl shrugs, takes a sip of his drink. Lee notices the Star
of David necklace he’s wearing under his shirt.
LEE (CONT’D)
Oh. (smiles)
Your mother wouldn’t like it.
Carl just looks at him. Lee can tell that he’s right.
LEE (CONT’D)
I had a homosexual Jewish friend
who lived in Oklahoma City. I asked
him: “Why do you live here? You
have enough money to live wherever
you like.” You know what he told
me? “It’d kill my mother if I moved
away.”
Lee laughs at his own joke. He looks at Carl for his
reaction: nothing. Lee deflates, perplexed, and downs his
drink.
EXT. AMSTERDAM AVENUE PARK - A LITTLE LATER
Lee and Carl walk in silence -- Carl is careful to keep some
distance between them. They pass under jacaranda trees,
flowers falling around them as if it were snowing.
2.
Lee opens his mouth to say something when, suddenly, Carl
bows his head.
CARL
Best of luck, Lee.
He puts out his hand for Lee to shake it. Lee looks at it,
taken aback. He shakes it.
Abruptly, Carl runs off. Lee watches as he hops into a
streetcar.
Beat. Lee turns around, walks into the park, and sits on a
concrete bench molded to resemble wood. He looks at the blue
flowers that surround the bench blowing about in the breeze.
He looks up at the sky: clouds are moving in for rain. He
sighs, defeated, and covers his face with his hands.
LEE’S MIND - THE PARK, AS IF IN A DREAM
Lee slowly removes his hands from his face and looks up to
see in front of him a shadowy LINE OF YOUNG MEN. The first
steps to the front, his beautiful face suddenly illuminated.
Lee looks at him, hopeful.
YOUNG MAN 1
Sorry. Best of luck.
Young man runs off for a streetcar. Lee deflates, turns back
to the line. Next young man, also beautiful, steps forward.
Lee brightens.
YOUNG MAN 2
Wrong number. Try again.
The young man runs off. Lee deflates.
The next young man -- most beautiful so far -- gets to the
front of the line. Lee is hopeful. Young man shakes his head.
YOUNG MAN 3
Can’t use it. Don’t need it. Don’t
want it. Sorry.
The young man runs off. Lee watches, despondent. The rest of
the young men in the line peel off in different directions
behind him.
YOUNG MAN 4
Somewhere else...
YOUNG MAN 5
Someplace else...
2.

3.
YOUNG MAN 6
Not here.
YOUNG MAN 7
Not me.
Lee turns his attention back to the line: only ONE YOUNG MAN
left.
He steps to the front: unlike the others, he’s hideous. He
too opens his mouth to reject Lee:
LEE
Who asked you, you ugly son of a
bitch?
The young man looks at him, taken aback. As his expression
turns to anger and he RAISES HIS FIST to strike Lee, SNAP
BACK TO:
THE PARK
Lee looks around.
TWO YOUNG MEXICAN MEN are walking by, arms around each
other’s necks. Lee stares at them. He sucks in air through
his dry, cracked lips.
INT. RATHSKELLER BAR - LATER, AFTERNOON
Lee drinks a double tequila. On the walls, there are cuckoo
clocks and moth-eaten deer heads. The place looks dreary, out-
of-place, filthy. A TV set emits horrible, guttural squawks.
LEE
I was in here last night. Got
talking to a queer doctor and his
boyfriend. The doc is a major in
the Medical Corps, the boyfriend
some kind of vague engineer. Awful
looking little bitch. So the doctor
invites me to have a drink with
them, and the boyfriend is getting
jealous, and I don’t want a beer
anyway, which the doctor takes as a
reflection on Mexico and on his own
person. He begins the do-you-like-
Mexico routine. So I tell him
Mexico is okay, some of it, but he
personally is a pain in the ass.
Told him this in a nice way, you
understand.

3.
LEE (CONT’D)
4.
Besides, I had to go home to my
wife in any case.
(downs his drink.)
So he says: “You don’t have any
wife, you are just as queer as I
am.” I told him: “I don’t know how
queer you are, Doc, and I ain’t
about to find out. It isn’t as if
you was a good-looking Mexican.
You’re a goddamned old, ugly-
looking Mexican. And that goes
double for your moth-eaten
boyfriend.” I was hoping, of
course, the deal wouldn’t come to
any extreme climax. You never knew
Hatfield?
We see that Lee is talking to WINSTON MOOR, a thin young
American man with long blond hair, pale blue eyes, very white
skin. He is barely feigning interest. There are dark patches
under Moor’s eyes -- he looks prematurely-aged: hateful and
passionless.
LEE (CONT’D)
Of course not. Before your time. He
killed a cargador in a pulqueria.
The deal cost him five hundred
dollars. Now, figuring a cargador
as rock bottom, think how much it
would cost you to shoot a major in
the Mexican Army.
Lee waits for Moor to react. Moor just stares at him blankly,
then turns and calls over a WAITER.
WINSTON MOOR
Yo quiero un sandwich!
Lee looks at him, annoyed.
WINSTON MOOR (CONT’D)
Quel sandwiches tiene?
LEE
What do you want?
WINSTON MOOR
I don’t know exactly... I wonder if
they could make me a melted cheese
sandwich on toasted whole-wheat
bread.
Moor turns to the waiter. Lee closes his eyes, tuning out,
annoyed, as Moor launches into his awful Spanish.
LEE (CONT’D)
4.
5.
WINSTON MOOR (CONT’D)
Es posible hacerme un sandwich con
queso uh... meltado. Pan de...
wheat? Melted cheese? Queso de
cheddar? Teine esto?
The waiter just looks at Moor blankly. Moor snarls.
WINSTON MOOR (CONT’D)
Oh, fuck it. Never mind.
Waiter leaves. Lee opens his eyes. Moor shrugs.
WINSTON MOOR (CONT’D)
Well... Jackie’s probably wondering
where I am.
Lee scowls at the mention of Moor’s wife, but Moor doesn’t
notice. He laughs, self-satisfied, affecting “sincerity.”
WINSTON MOOR (CONT’D)
At first, Bill, she was so
dependent on me that she used
literally to have hysterics when I
had to go to the museum where I
work. I managed to build up her ego
to the point where she didn’t need
me, and after that the only thing I
could do was leave. There was
nothing more I could do for her.
Lee gestures for another tequila. Moor gets up to leave.
WINSTON MOOR (CONT’D)
Anyway, I have to be going. I have
a lot of things to do.
LEE
Well, listen, how about dinner
tonight?
WINSTON MOOR
(beat.)
All right.
LEE
At six in the K.C. Steak House?
WINSTON MOOR
All right.
Moor walks away. Lee watches him go over to a table near the
front door and speak with another American young man, TOM
WILLIAMS. Moor says something to Williams.
5.
6.
They both look over at Lee. Williams laughs. Moor pats him on
the shoulder appreciatively, leaves.
Lee frowns and looks down at his empty tequila glass,
catching his own reflection:
LEE’S REFLECTION
You must be crazy making passes in
that direction when you know what a
bitch he is...
Waiter brings another tequila. Lee downs it, shakes his head.
LEE
These borderline characters can out-
bitch any fag.
EXT. OUTSIDE THE K.C. STEAKHOUSE - LATER, NIGHT
Lee, Moor, and Williams, whom Moor has brought along, stand
outside the restaurant after dinner.
LEE
Would you gentleman care for a
drink? I’ll get a bottle...
Moor and Williams looks at each other.
WINSTON MOOR
Well, uh... no. You see, we were
hoping to work on the plans for
this boat we’re going to build.
LEE
A boat?
WINSTON MOOR
Yes... at Zihuatanejo.
LEE
(laughs)
Boat building is a job for
professionals, isn’t it?
Neither of them says anything.
LEE (CONT’D)
Well... All right. I’ll see you
tomorrow? How about meeting me for
a drink in the Rathskeller? Say
around five?
6.
7.
WINSTON MOOR
I expect I’ll be busy tomorrow.
LEE
Yes, but you have to eat and drink.
WINSTON MOOR
Well, you see... this boat is more
important to me than anything right
now. It will take up all my time.
Beat. Lee looks at him. Moor looks back at him awkwardly.
LEE
Suit yourself.
He turns around, disappointed, and walks away. We follow as,
over Lee’s shoulder, Moor turns to Williams.
WINSTON MOOR
Thanks for running interference,
Tom. I hope he got the idea.
Williams nods sympathetically. Lee doesn’t stop walking, but
it’s clear from his face that he can hear them.
WINSTON MOOR (CONT’D)
I like the guy, but I can’t stand
to be alone with him. He keeps
trying to go to bed with me. That’s
what I don’t like about queers. You
can’t keep it on the basis of
friendship.
Lee scowls, keeps walking.
INT. RATHSKELLER BAR - A FEW WEEKS LATER, AFTERNOON
Lee sits, a tequila in front of him, examining his stainless-
steel pocketknife: the chrome plating on the handle is
peeling off.
LEE
Everything made in this country
falls apart...
He lets the knife fall on the table with a dull clang.
LEE (CONT’D)
Wouldn’t surprise me if I picked up
a boy in the Alameda and his --
7.
8.
JOE GUIDRY (O.S.)
Someone stole my typewriter.
Lee looks up: JOE GUIDRY, 40s, a large American man with a
politician’s red Irish face, sits across from him with a
beer. He wears a watch and a beautiful pair of boots.
JOE GUIDRY (CONT’D)
It was that Brazilian, or whatever
he is. You know him. Maurice.
LEE
Is that the one you had last week?
The wrestler?
JOE GUIDRY
You mean Louie, the gym instructor.
No, this is another one. Louie has
decided all that sort of thing is
very wrong, and he tells me that I
am going to burn in hell but he is
going to heaven.
LEE
Serious?
JOE GUIDRY
Oh, yes.
(laughs)
Well, Maurice is as queer as I am.
(belches)
Excuse me. If not queerer. But he
won’t accept it. I think stealing
my typewriter is a way he takes to
demonstrate to me and to himself
that he is just in it for all he
can get. As a matter of fact, he’s
so queer I’ve lost interest in him.
Not completely though. When I see
the little bastard, I’ll most
likely invite him back to my
apartment instead of beating the
shit out of him like I should.
Lee tips his chair back against the wall and looks around the
room: someone is quietly writing a letter at the next table.
The PROPRIETOR of the bar is reading the bullfight section of
the newspaper. The room emits a vibrating, soundless hum.
Joe finishes his beer, wipes his mouth with the back of his
hand, and stares at the wall with watery, bloodshot eyes.
8.
9.
As Lee stares straight in front of him, something strange
happens: the silence buzzes and becomes gradually louder, as
if it’s seeping into Lee’s body: his face goes slack and
blank, and gradually, his face starts to become spectral, see-
through: we can literally see the wall behind him. The
outline of Lee’s translucent face is ravaged, vicious, old,
but his clear green eyes are dreamy, innocent, glowing.
JOE GUIDRY (CONT’D)
Well, I have to be going.
Lee’s face snaps back to normal, and Joe gets up and starts
gathering his bundles. He nods at Lee and walks out the door.
Lee just sits there, watching him go.
EXT. THE STREET - LATER, DAY
Lee walks aimlessly. He stops at a magazine counter, skims
through a newspaper, puts it back. He keeps walking.
He passes the K.C. Steak House and sees Winston Moor through
the window, eating alone.
Moor sees Lee, beckons to him. Lee looks at him: Moor looks
terrible: greenish steam comes off his head and body, pouring
out of his ears and mouth. Lee stares at him, disturbed,
confused, then walks on. Moor watches him go.
Lee passes a whorehouse, a LEPER selling disgusting-looking
food on the street, a CROWD gathered around a cockfight.
Out of the corner of his eye, he sees an obvious GROUP of
AMERICAN EX-PATS. He studies them: some wear red-checked
shirts outside the belt, blue jeans, beards. Some wear more
conventional, shabby clothes.
As Lee looks them over, one young man looks up at him. He is
tall, very thin, high cheekbones, a small, bright-red mouth,
and bright blue eyes that have taken on a faint, drunken
violet flush.
The man stops Lee in his tracks: he’s clean cut, boyish,
while also looking exotic -- as if he were wearing makeup.
Though he’s in his mid 30s, he feels somehow much younger.
Lee stares: This is EUGENE ALLERTON.
Allerton smiles casually at him: it’s like a shockwave is
sent through Lee’s body. Lee nods and smiles at him. Allerton
nods back, turns away from him, and keeps walking.
9.
10.
INT. THE SHIP AHOY - LATER, NIGHT
Lee walks into a bar with a “nautical” atmosphere and heads
directly for the bar. Bartender pours him a double tequila.
Lee sips it and looks around the place: it’s decorated with
phony hurricane lamps, dimly lit, sinister-looking. There are
two small rooms with tables, the bar in one room, and four
high, precarious stools.
Lee’s eyes pass over the PATRONS: they are clean-cut for the
most part, American ex-pats. He spots TOM WESTON, the
American owner of the place, chatting with JOHN DUMÉ, an
elegantly dressed queer man. Finally, Lee’s eyes stop on a
table in the far corner: Allerton sits alone, holding a
bottle of beer on his knee. He wears glasses.
Lee’s eyes flash with excitement. Allerton, feeling the gaze
on him, turns around to look at Lee. Lee tenses up, nervous.
Allerton nods at him casually.
Lee, trying to achieve a greeting at once friendly and
casual, gets up from his stool and bows in a sort of mock-
dignified old-world greeting. He attempts to smile warmly,
showing an appropriate amount of interest, but what emerges
instead is a leer of naked lust: it is horrible, ghastly.
Allerton recoils and looks at Lee as if something were
seriously wrong with him. Lee is instantly mortified.
Allerton turns away. It’s not cold or hostile: it’s just as
if Lee doesn’t exist. The connection is instantly severed.
Lee looks at the back of Allerton’s head helplessly for a
moment, then turns back to the bar, defeated and shaken.
Tom Weston, who’s seen everything, looks at Lee
sympathetically. Lee makes eye contact with him for a second,
then looks to the bartender, who puts another drink in front
of him. He downs it in one gulp.
Lee turns around and sees that Allerton is now at another
table, playing chess with MARY, a slightly older, vivacious
American woman with dyed red hair.
The energy between Allerton and Mary is clearly familiar,
flirtatious. Lee watches for a beat, eyes full of longing and
self-hatred, before he throws some money on the counter and
gets up.
10.
11.
EXT. THE CHIMU BAR - LATER, NIGHT
Lee walks up to what looks like an unassuming cantina. He
pauses at the doorway, sighs, heads in.
INT. CHIMU BAR
As Lee enters, it’s clear immediately: this is a queer bar.
There is a little stage at the front where a YOUNG MEXICAN
MAN sings as few people listen and dance.
Lee looks around at the scene as he makes his way to the bar:
THREE MEXICAN GAYS are posturing in front of the jukebox. All
around the room, men are talking close with one another,
dancing. Some WAITERS go around taking orders. Lee gets a
tequila at the bar. One of the MEXICAN GAYS slithers up to
him and puts a hand on his shoulder. Lee looks at him with a
mix of fascination and disgust. The Mexican suggestively
makes the gesture of a cigarette.
Lee fishes one out and extends it to the Mexican, who puts it
in his mouth and looks into Lee’s eyes as he lights it.
MEXICAN GAY
Gracias.
He exhales in Lee’s face, turns and walks back to the
jukebox. Lee watches, at once arrested and repulsed.
As the Young Mexican Man onstage finishes his song to some
scattered applause and goes to sit down, Lee looks around the
room at the other GAYS: one sits in a booth, perfectly
immobile, with a stupid, animal serenity; another dances in a
way that suggests ancient temple dancing.
Lee turns and sees that the Young Mexican Man is now sitting
alone a few seats away from him at the bar, sipping a drink.
The young man looks shy, a bit sad, a bit out of place now
that he’s not onstage. Lee looks him over.
LEE
Por que si triste?
The young man looks up at Lee and smiles, revealing very red
gums and sharp teeth, far apart. He shrugs.
YOUNG MEXICAN MAN
No estoy triste... No realmente.
Lee looks at the man, looks around the room, back at the man.
11.
12.
LEE
(gesturing to a smaller
room off to the side)
Vamanos para allá.
Beat. The young man nods.
A BOOTH - LATER
Lee and the young man sit on the same side of a booth tucked
into the corner room of the Chimu, with a view through the
doorway of the bar. Lee drinks a coffee. The young man drinks
a beer, smokes a cigarette.
Young man drops his hand down and feels Lee’s leg under the
table.
Lee keeps drinking his coffee, looking straight ahead at the
bar, but it’s clear that he’s excited.
INT. HOTEL LOBBY - LATER
A neon light near the entrance shines harshly on Lee as he
pushes five pesos through the grill. OLD MAN behind the desk
takes the money without even looking at the two of them.
INT. HOTEL ROOM - LATER
The old man unlocks the door to a dingy, small room. Lee and
the young man enter. Old man dispassionately drops a ragged
towel on a chair and leaves, closing the door behind him.
Lee starts undressing. Young man catches sight of something.
YOUNG MEXICAN MAN
Traes pistola?
LEE
Yes. I carry a pistol.
Young man watches as Lee folds his pants and drops them over
the chair. He places his pistol on his pants, then drops his
shirt and his underwear on the pistol.
We see Lee’s body for the first time: though he’s in his 40s,
he has the thin body of an adolescent -- shoulders and chest
wide across and very shallow, stomach flat, body hair sparse
and dark.
Lee sits down naked at the edge of the bed and looks at the
young man, who has also begun undressing.
12.
13.
Young man folds his worn blue suit with care. He takes off
his shirt and places it around his coat on the back of a
chair.
Lee looks at the young man’s smooth, copper-colored skin as
he steps out of his shorts. He turns and looks at Lee, naked.
The young man walks over and sits beside Lee on the bed.
Beat.
Lee runs a hand slowly over the young man’s back. With the
other hand, he follows the curve of the man’s chest down over
his flat, brown stomach. The man smiles and lies down on the
bed.
Lee moves on top of him, grabbing ahold of the man’s penis,
which is already hard. The man grabs ahold of Lee. They look
into each other’s eyes, stroking each other. The young man
spits into his hand and runs it over Lee’s penis.
As Lee fucks him, his body moves in rhythmic contractions,
every muscle caressing the young man’s smooth, hard body,
until finally, Lee tenses convulsively rigid, sparks flash
behind his eyes, and the breath whistles through his teeth.
Slowly, Lee relaxes his muscles and moves off of the young
man. They lie naked next to each other, shoulders touching,
catching their breath.
Lee gets out of bed and gets the cigarettes from his coat. He
gets back to the bed and lights one for the young man, then
for himself. They smoke them next to each other in silence
for a long beat, saying nothing.
YOUNG MEXICAN MAN
Tengo que irme.
He gets up abruptly and starts getting dressed. So does Lee.
As Lee is rifling through his clothes, he takes out his
wallet and starts counting out a few bills, looking at the
young man, whose back is turned to him. Does he expect money?
Young man keeps getting dressed. Lee decides against paying
him, puts the money back in the wallet.
INT. LOLA’S - AFTERNOON, A FEW DAYS LATER
Lee sits reading Ultimas Noticias aloud to JIM COCHRAN,
another American, who keeps unsuccessfully looking for a
moment to excuse himself.
13.
14.
LEE
Get a load of this.
(reads)
“When his wife came home from the
market, her husband, already drunk,
was brandishing his .45”
(looks up at Cochran)
Why do they always have to
“brandish” it?
Cochran starts to get up and say something, but Lee looks
back at the newspaper, seeing another detail.
LEE (CONT’D)
Jesus Christ.
Cochran sighs.
LEE (CONT’D)
After he killed his wife and three
children, he takes a razor and puts
on a suicide act.
(reads)
“But resulted only with scratches
that did not require medical
attention.”
(laughs)
What a slobbish performance!
COCHRAN
Listen, Lee --
LEE
(not listening)
Here’s a man was surprised in his
taco stand with a dressed-down
dog... a great long skinny hound
dog at that. There’s a picture of
him posing in front of his taco
stand with the dog... One citizen
asked another for a light. The
party in second part don’t have a
match so first part pulls an ice
pick and kills him. Murder is the
national neurosis of Mexico...
Cochran stands up to go. Lee is instantly on his feet.
LEE (CONT’D)
Sit down on your ass! Or what’s
left of it after four years in the
navy.
14.
15.
COCHRAN
I gotta go.
LEE
What are you, henpecked?
COCHRAN
No kidding. I been out too much. My
old lady --
But Lee’s no longer listening: something has caught his eye
out the window: Allerton is walking by. He stops, looks in,
seemingly right at Lee. Lee straightens up, excited.
He is about to wave when Allerton, without seeming to
acknowledge him, continues to walk on. Lee deflates.
COCHRAN (CONT’D)
Anyway... Bye, Lee.
Cochran turns to go. Lee just keeps looking out the window.
Suddenly, he turns around and brushes past Cochran to the
door, running out after Allerton.
EXT. THE STREET - CONTINUOUS
Allerton is already half a block away. Behind him, we see Lee
running out of Lola’s to catch up.
When Lee gets within a few paces, he slows down to a brisk
walk, trying to look casual. Allerton looks over at him.
LEE
Hi!
ALLERTON
Hi...
Lee looks crazy, out of breath, but he’s smiling, friendly.
LEE
I just wanted to tell you... Mary
was in Lola’s a little while ago.
She asked me to tell you she would
be in the Ship Ahoy later on,
around five.
ALLERTON
Oh... Thank you.
Lee catches his breath. Allerton looks at him.
15.
16.
ALLERTON (CONT’D)
Will you be around tonight?
LEE
Yes! (correcting himself to
sound more casual)
I think so.
Allerton nods with a slight smile. Lee nods back, turns
around. They walk away in opposite directions.
INT. THE SHIP AHOY - LATER
Allerton is sitting with Mary, quietly setting up the chess
board for a game: Mary plays black, Allerton white.
In the background, Lee walks in the front door, spots them.
He walks over, excited but trying to look casual. When he
gets to their table, they both look up at him. Lee does a
strange, old-world bow, as if they were all old friends.
Mary and Allerton nod to him, polite but weirded out. As Lee
walks to the bar, Mary leans in and whispers.
MARY
Who is he?
Allerton looks off at Lee, disturbed.
ALLERTON
I have no idea...
Mary laughs, putting her hand in front of her mouth.
At the bar, Lee hears Mary laughing, but he doesn’t turn
around. The bartender pours Lee a drink.
Back at the table, Allerton keeps looking at him.
Mary clears her throat. Allerton looks at her. She points to
the board: it’s his move. He picks up his pawn and moves it,
then looks back at Lee.
Lee still doesn’t turn around, but as he sips his drink, it’s
clear that his mind is focused solely on Allerton’s table.
INT. SHIP AHOY - LATER
Lee is now drunk, still sitting alone at the bar.
16.
(MORE)
17.
Around him, the place has become filled with drunks, talking
loudly. Music blares over the jukebox.
Someone pushes their way to the bar, bumping into him.
ALLERTON (O.S.)
Two rum and cokes!
Lee looks up, annoyed, but his expression changes when he
sees Allerton smiling down at him, drunk, face flushed.
They stare at each other, something passing between them.
BARTENDER
Five pesos.
Allerton turns, pays the bartender. Lee is surprised when
Allerton hands him one of the drinks and gestures to a table.
ALLERTON
Come sit with us over there.
Lee smiles, trying to contain his excitement.
THE TABLE IN THE CORNER - LATER
Allerton and Lee sit amongst some YOUNG AMERICANS, who are
all drunk, talking loudly, but the two of them focus only on
each other, each a few more drinks in, mid-conversation.
LEE
How did you check the accuracy of
the information?
ALLERTON
Actually, we didn’t.
(laughs, takes a drink)
The Counter Intelligence Corps got
sucked in on a lot of phony deals
when I was in Germany. Of course,
we cross-checked all information
with other informants and we had
our own agents in the field --
As Allerton talks, Lee stares at his face and body, taking in
every detail: the thin hands, the blue eyes with a hint of
violet, the flush of his cheeks.
ALLERTON (CONT’D)
Most of our informants turned in
some phony information, but this
one character made it all up.
(MORE)
17.
ALLERTON (CONT’D)
18.
He had our agents out looking for a
whole fictitious network of Russian
spies. So finally, the report comes
back from Frankfurt -- it’s all a
lot of crap! But instead of
clearing out of town before the
information could be checked, he
came back with more.
Allerton laughs, clearly delighted by his own story. Lee’s
mind projects an imaginary, ghost-like hand reaching out to
touch Allerton’s face.
ALLERTON (CONT’D)
At this point we’d really had
enough of his bullshit, so we
locked him up in a cellar.
Lee’s ectoplasmic fingers caress Allerton’s ear, smooth his
eyebrows, brush through the hair near his face...
ALLERTON (CONT’D)
The room was pretty cold and
uncomfortable, but that was all we
could do. We had to handle
prisoners very careful.
Lee’s ghost hand just ever so slightly manages to move
Allerton’s hair in the physical world. Allerton feels a
strand fall in front of his eyes. Oblivious to what’s
happening in Lee’s mind, he brushes it back out of his face.
Lee’s mouth hangs open like an animal, so full of desire that
he feels an aching pain in his lungs...
ALLERTON (CONT’D)
He kept typing out confessions,
enormous things...
Lee begins to snarl and lick his lips, tuning out the sound
of Allerton’s voice. He imagines two phantom hands now
running through Allerton’s hair.
ALLERTON (CONT’D)
I went to the door and there he was
with a branch in his mouth.
Lee looks at him. Allerton is looking back at him, waiting
for a response.
LEE
(stammering)
A branch in his mouth...
Allerton nods, smiling.
ALLERTON (CONT’D)
18.
19.
LEE (CONT’D)
Uh... a big branch?
ALLERTON
It was about two feet long!
Allerton keeps laughing. Lee laughs with him, dumbly, unsure
what he’s talking about, just looking at his face.
EXT. THE STREET - ALMOST DAWN
Lee and Allerton walk on empty, quiet streets, an awkward
amount of space between them: they are just a bit too close.
They realize and separate. Lee can hardly look at him.
Allerton stops in front of a building. Lee looks at it.
LEE
You go in here?
ALLERTON
(nods)
I have a sack here.
Beat.
LEE
Well... good night.
ALLERTON
Good night.
They look at each other. Lee isn’t sure whether he should
shake his hand, pat him on the shoulder, kiss him.
Before he can decide, Allerton turns and walks into the
building. Lee stands for a moment, then turns and walks away.
INT. LEE’S BEDROOM - THE NEXT DAY
At first, we see just a still image that takes up the whole
screen -- a faded color photograph of a crowded arena.
Click. We cycle to the next image: a bullfighter, standing,
drinking water, waiting.
Click. The next image: the bull in the pen, also waiting.
Finally, we see Lee, fully dressed, sitting on his bed
looking through a VIEWMASTER. He clicks through a series of
images. The clock on the dresser read 4:54 PM.
19.
20.
Brrring brrring brrring brrrring.
The ALARM on the clock starts going off as the minute hand
turns to 4:55. Lee puts down the Viewmaster, springs up.
INT. SHIP AHOY - LATER
Lee talks, animated, with Allerton. When Allerton’s not
looking, Lee stares at his face, searchingly.
He looks at Allerton’s thin hand as he gestures for a drink.
Allerton catches him staring -- Lee looks away.
INT. SHIP AHOY - AFTERNOON, A FEW WEEKS LATER
Joe Guidry sits, depressed, getting drunk, he wears a pair of
cheap Mexican sandals.
JOE GUIDRY
The trouble with me is... I like
the type that robs me...
We see that Guidry is sitting across from Lee and Allerton.
As Guidry raises his glass to his face, Lee looks at his
wrist, notices the tan line where a watch used to be.
LEE
Where you make your mistake is
bringing them to your apartment.
That’s what hotels are for.
JOE GUIDRY
(laughs.)
You’re right there. But half the
time I don’t have money for a
hotel. Besides...
(drinks)
I like someone around to cook
breakfast and sweep the place out.
LEE
You mean clean the place out.
JOE GUIDRY
(sadly)
I don’t mind the watch and the
radio, but it really hurt, losing
those boots. They were a thing of
beauty and a joy forever...
20.
(MORE)
21.
Guidry looks off wistfully, tapping his feet in his sandals.
He glances at Allerton.
JOE GUIDRY (CONT’D)
I don’t know whether I ought to say
things like this in front of Junior
here. No offense, kid.
ALLERTON
Go ahead.
JOE GUIDRY
Did I tell you how I made the cop
on the beat?
Lee shakes his head.
JOE GUIDRY (CONT’D)
He’s the vigilante, the watchman
out where I live. Every time he
sees the light on in my room, he
comes in for a shot of rum. Well,
about five nights ago, he caught me
when I was drunk and horny, and one
thing led to another and I ended up
showing him how the cow ate the
cabbage.
Lee looks at Allerton for his reaction: Allerton’s face is
neutral, hard to read.
JOE GUIDRY (CONT’D)
So the night after I make him, I
was walking by the beer joint on
the corner, and he comes out
borracho and says: “Have a drink.”
I said: “I don’t want a drink.” So
he takes out his pistola and says:
“Have a drink.” I proceeded to take
his pistola away from him, and he
goes into the beer joint to phone
for reinforcements. So I had to go
in and rip the phone off the wall.
Now they’re billing me for the
phone.
Lee laughs.
JOE GUIDRY (CONT’D)
When I got back to my room, which
is on the ground floor, he had
written “El Puto Gringo” on the
window with soap. So instead of
wiping it off, I left it there.
(MORE)
21.
JOE GUIDRY (CONT’D)
(MORE)
22.
(looks at Allerton)
It pays to advertise.
Allerton smiles. Lee looks back and forth between them,
trying to gauge Allerton’s feelings about the story.
A WAITRESS comes by to take their empty glasses.
WAITRESS
Gustan más?
Lee looks up at her.
LEE
Si. Mucho mas.
Waitress rolls her eyes, leaves. Allerton gets up.
ALLERTON
Excuse me.
He heads for the restroom. Lee and Guidry watch him go.
Guidry turns to Lee and sees the way Lee looks at Allerton.
LEE
You think he’s queer?
Guidry turns and watches Allerton walk. He shrugs. Allerton
enters the restroom. Lee turns to Guidry.
LEE (CONT’D)
I’ve been seeing him for a few
weeks --
JOE GUIDRY
Seeing him?
LEE
Spending time with him. And I can’t
tell.
JOE GUIDRY
You could always just ask.
LEE
(shakes his head)
No.
JOE GUIDRY (CONT’D)
(MORE)
22.
LEE (CONT’D)
23.
Either you’ve gotta be dramatic and
do the whole something-I-have-to-
tell-you routine or you try to do
it casually, and you say: “I’m
queer, you know, by the way...” And
then they don’t hear you and they
yell: “What?” Or you toss in: “If
you were as queer as I am...” And
then he yawns and changes the
subject.
The waitress comes back, plunks down three new glasses. Lee
looks up at her. Guidry looks over at the bar.
JOE GUIDRY
Well, he must be queer if he’s
talking to him.
Lee looks at Guidry. Guidry points to the bar, where Allerton
is now speaking to JOHN DUMÉ, the elegantly dressed queer man
we saw talking to Tom Weston in an earlier scene.
JOE GUIDRY (CONT’D)
Dumé’s part of that little clique
of queers who go to that beer joint
on Campeche: The Green Lantern.
LEE
(scowls.)
I know who he is...
Lee watches Allerton’s body language as he talks with Dumé,
looking for some kind of sign. Guidry laughs.
JOE GUIDRY
He’s the only one of that crew
who’d be welcome in a place like
this. The rest of those Green
Lantern boys are a bunch of
screaming fags.
Lee just keeps staring at the two of them.
LEE
Excuse me.
He downs his drink, starts walking over to the bar. Guidry
smiles. When he’s about half-way there, Dumé pats Allerton on
the back and Allerton gets up and starts walking away towards
the other end of the room.
LEE (CONT’D)
23.
24.
Lee stops, awkwardly stuck in the middle of the room. He
looks at Allerton, who’s approaching a table where Mary is
playing chess with a PERUVIAN MAN, then he looks back at the
bar, then at Guidry, who’s been watching.
Lee scowls at him, turns and keeps walking to the bar. He
gets there and stands next to Dumé. He gestures to the
bartender for a drink, then looks back at Allerton.
JOHN DUMÉ (O.S.)
How do you like this character?
Lee looks over. Dumé smiles, waves with his beer bottle over
in Allerton’s direction.
JOHN DUMÉ (CONT’D)
He comes to me and says: “I thought
you were one of the Green Lantern
Boys.” So I said: “Well, I am.”
(laughs)
He wants me to take him around to
some of the gay places here.
Lee looks at Dumé, surprised. Dumé shrugs.
JOHN DUMÉ (CONT’D)
As a general rule, I don’t take
people to the Lantern. Either
you’re going there or you’re not.
But something about the way he
asked me -- I just couldn’t say no.
Lee looks over at the table where Allerton’s playing chess.
He studies his face closely.
JOHN DUMÉ (CONT’D)
You don’t know him, do you?
LEE
(looking at Allerton,
distracted.)
Huh?
JOHN DUMÉ
He’s always in here playing chess
with that girl. What’s her name?
LEE
Mary.
JOHN DUMÉ
Right. Mary. She seems nice.
Lee scoffs.
24.
25.
JOHN DUMÉ (CONT’D)
Though I suppose if she’s his
girlfriend, she’s in for a bit of a
surprise.
LEE
(confused.)
What?
Dume looks at him for a beat, laughs.
JOHN DUMÉ
You all right, Lee?
LEE
(cold.)
I’m fine.
JOHN DUMÉ
I asked if you know that boy and
you still haven’t given me an
answer.
LEE
Oh... Yes. I mean, no. A little.
JOHN DUMÉ
What’s he like?
LEE
What’s he like?
Dume, exasperated, just gives him a look. Lee says nothing.
Dume sighs and pats Lee on the shoulder.
JOHN DUMÉ
Thank you, as always, for the
enlightening conversation.
Dume gets up and leaves, taking his beer. Lee just keeps
looking over at Allerton.
Allerton feels Lee’s eyes on him: he looks up and waves,
casually. Lee, disoriented, waves back.
INT. MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT, A FEW DAYS LATER
Cocteau’s Orpheus plays, dubbed in Spanish. Jean Marais
(Orpheus) and Francios Perier (Huertebise) are in Eurydice’s
bedroom. Orpheus puts on a pair of strange gloves. Huertebise
watches as Orpheus puts his hands out in front of him and
starts walking towards the mirror, trying to pass through.
25.
26.
As they watch in the half-full theater, Lee doesn’t look at
Allerton, but his entire consciousness is focused on him, as
if, out of the side of his face, Lee can see Allerton’s eyes
watching the screen, his chest taking in air, exhaling, his
dick and balls, sweating beneath his pants. Lee breathes in,
taking in Allerton’s scent.
Onscreen, Orpheus gets to the mirror: he can’t pass through.
HUERTEBISE
Perhaps you’re afraid?
ORPHEUS
No. But this mirror is a mirror,
and in it I see an unhappy man.
HUERTEBISE
You do not have to understand. You
just have to believe.
Huertebise gets behind Orpheus, puts his hands on his
shoulders and begins to push. The mirror now becomes like
water: his hands start to go through.
Allerton shifts in his seat. Lee twinges, full of longing.
As Orpheus and Huertebise pass through the mirror, entering a
surreal, dream-like landscape, Lee takes off his glasses and
runs his hand over his closed eyes, restless with desire.
INT. LOLA’S - LATER
Lee, looking as though he has a headache, drinks a double
tequila. Allerton drinks a rum and coke.
LEE
What did you, uh, what did you
think of the picture?
ALLERTON
Enjoyed parts of it.
LEE
Yes... So did I.
Lee downs the rest of his drink.
He stares at Allerton, who’s studying the menu. He musters up
a little courage.
LEE (CONT’D)
By the way, the law was in putting
the bite on the Ship Ahoy again.
26.
27.
Allerton looks up at him.
LEE (CONT’D)
Vice squad. Two hundred pesos. I
can see them in the station house
after a hard day shaking down
citizens of the Federal District.
(Mexican voice)
“Ah, Gonzalez, you should see what
I got today. Oh la la, such a
bite.”
(doing other cop’s voice)
“Aah, you shook down a puto queer
for two pesetas in a bus station
crapper. We know you, Hernandez,
and your cheap tricks. You’re the
cheapest cop inna Federal
District.”
Allerton smiles slightly. Lee looks at his face, studying it
for more of a reaction, but when he sees that Allerton has
noticed him staring, he quickly looks off, waves to a WAITER.
LEE (CONT’D)
Hey, Jack! Dos martinis, much dry.
Seco. And dos plates Sheeska Babe.
Sabe?
Waiter walks over and looks at him, unamused.
WAITER
(in perfect English)
That’s two dry martinis and two
orders of shish kebab?
LEE
Solid, pops.
Waiter just looks at him. He takes their menus and leaves.
Beat. Lee turns to Allerton, as casually as he can.
LEE (CONT’D)
So... How was your evening with
Dumé?
Allerton looks at him. Lee looks back, trying his hardest to
hide the intensity of his interest. Allerton shrugs.
ALLERTON
We went to several bars full of
queers. One place a character asked
me to dance and propositioned me.
27.
28.
LEE
Take him up?
ALLERTON
No.
Beat. Lee searches his face, considers what to say next.
LEE
Dumé is a nice fellow.
ALLERTON
Yes... But he’s not a person I
would confide too much in.
(beat.)
That is... anything I wanted to
keep private.
LEE
(very carefully)
You refer to a specific
indiscretion?
ALLERTON
Frankly... yes.
Beat. Lee can hardly breathe.
LEE
I see.
They just look at each other. Lee’s heart is pounding.
Waiter breaks the tension by plopping down two martinis on
the table. Lee, startled, grateful for the release, looks at
his martini, then holds it up to the candle, inspecting it.
LEE (CONT’D)
The inevitable watery martini with
a decomposing olive.
He smiles at Allerton, who doesn’t react. Lee frowns, downs
the martini for courage once again.
LEE (CONT’D)
So --
LITTLE BOY (O.S.)
BILLETES DE LOTERÍA!
Lee turns around and sees a LITTLE BOY, 10, who has entered
with box tied around his neck full of lottery tickets.
28.
29.
LITTLE BOY (CONT’D)
BILLETES DE LOTERÍA DE A PESO!
Lee rolls his eyes, annoyed. The boy goes from table to
table, getting shooed away by the other annoyed patrons.
LITTLE BOY (CONT’D)
Billetes de loteria?
Someone kicks him. Boy just keeps smiling.
LITTLE BOY (CONT’D)
Un billete? Un billete?
LEE
Hey! Aqui.
The boy looks over at him. Lee gestures for him to come.
The boy rushes over. Lee takes out two five peso bills. Boy’s
eyes go wide. Lee puts his hand on his shoulder, kindly.
LEE (CONT’D)
Go buy yourself some marijuana,
son.
Boy just looks at him, stunned, no idea what Lee is saying.
He fumbles in his box and takes out ten lottery tickets.
Lee grabs them and shoos the boy away impatiently. The boy
rushes out of the restaurant, triumphant. Lee turns back to
Allerton, who is smiling. Lee smiles too, happy that
Allerton’s amused.
He opens his mouth again to speak when the waiter returns
carrying the shish kebab. Lee closes his mouth, watches as
the Waiter puts the plates down slowly and carefully picks up
Lee’s empty martini glass, leaves.
Allerton starts eating. Lee watches him for a long moment.
Finally, he can’t take it anymore. He blurts out:
LEE (CONT’D)
So Dumé told you about my, uh,
proclivities?
Allerton looks up, mouth full, casual:
ALLERTON
Yes.
They look at each other for a beat as Allerton finishes
chewing, swallows. Allerton turns his attention back to his
food. Lee just looks at him eating, unsure how to proceed.
29.
(MORE)
30.
LEE
A curse... Been in our family for
generations... The Lees have always
been perverts.
Allerton looks up from his plate.
LEE (CONT’D)
I shall never forget the
unspeakable horror that froze the
lymph in my glands -- the lymph
glands that is, of course -- when
the baneful word seared my reeling
brain:
(dramatically)
Homosexual.
Someone at the next table looks over. Allerton smiles.
LEE (CONT’D)
I thought of the painted, simpering
female impersonators I had seen in
a Baltimore night club. Could it be
possible that I was one of those
subhuman things? I walked the
streets in a daze, like a man with
a light concussion. I might well
have destroyed myself, ending an
existence which seemed to offer
nothing but grotesque misery and
humiliation. Nobler, I thought, to
die a man than to live on, a sex
monster. It was a wise old queen --
Bobo, we called her -- who taught
me that I had a duty to live and to
bear my burden proudly for all to
see, to conquer prejudice and
ignorance and hate with knowledge
and sincerity and love. Whenever
you are threatened by a hostile
presence, you emit a thick cloud of
love like an octopus squirts out
ink.
Allerton smiles. Lee affects a mockingly mournful expression.
LEE (CONT’D)
Poor Bobo came to a sticky end...
He was riding in the Duc de
Ventre’s Hispano-Suiza when his
falling piles blew out of the car
and wrapped around the rear wheel.
(MORE)
30.
LEE (CONT’D)
31.
He was completely gutted, leaving
an empty shell sitting there on the
giraffe-skin upholstery. Even the
eyes and the brain went, with a
horrible slupping sound. The Duc
says he will carry that ghastly
slup with him to his mausoleum.
(looks mournfully at his
shish kebab)
Then I knew the meaning of
loneliness. But Bobo’s words came
back to me from the tomb, the
sibilants cracking gently. “No one
is ever really alone. You are part
of everything that’s alive.”
(looks up at Allerton)
The difficulty is to convince
someone else he is really part of
you, so what the hell? Us parts
ought to work together. Reet?
Lee pauses, looks at Allerton, who has almost finished his
shish kebab. He frowns, unsure where he stands with him.
LEE (CONT’D)
What I mean is, Allerton: We are
all parts of a tremendous whole. No
use fighting it.
Allerton looks up at Lee, impenetrable. Lee sighs, looks off
at the waiter, gesturing for another round of drinks. He
turns back to Allerton.
LEE (CONT’D)
Don’t these gay bars depress you?
Allerton doesn’t say anything.
LEE (CONT’D)
Of course, the queer bars here
aren’t to compare with stateside
queer joints.
ALLERTON
(shrugs)
I wouldn’t know.
Lee looks at him.
ALLERTON (CONT’D)
I’ve never been in any queer joints
except those Dumé took me to. I
guess there’s kicks and kicks.
LEE (CONT’D)
31.
32.
LEE
You haven’t? Really?
ALLERTON
(shakes his head)
No. Never.
Lee just keeps looking at him, confused, perturbed.
Waiter comes and puts down the drinks. Lee keeps looking at
Allerton, who finishes his food. Lee hasn’t touched his.
EXT. THE STREET - LATER
Lee and Allerton walk in the cool night past buildings with
neon light that shines on their faces. There’s a clear, green
crescent moon in the sky.
LEE
Shall we go to my place for a
drink? I have some Napoleon brandy.
Beat. Allerton shrugs.
ALLERTON
All right.
Lee smiles, waves for a cab. Almost immediately, one pulls
up. Lee yells to the guy in terrible Spanish.
LEE
Insurgentes y Monterrery. Tres
pesos.
DRIVER
Cuatro.
Lee waves the guy on impatiently. Guy scowls, muttering.
DRIVER (CONT’D)
Che gringo hijo de tu puta madre.
He throws the door to the cab open and gestures roughly for
Lee and Allerton to get in. Lee smiles.
DRIVER (CONT’D)
(mumbling to himself.)
Pinches güeros codos. Por un puto
peso.
32.
(MORE)
33.
LEE
(cheeky, having understood
just fine.)
Sorry, I didn’t catch that.
Driver looks at him, death stare.
DRIVER
Get in the fucking car.
Allerton smiles, turns to Lee, deadpan.
ALLERTON
Sometimes, I think they don’t like
us.
INT. LEE’S APARTMENT - LATER
Lee opens the door and turns on a light. We see Lee’s space
for the first time: piles of clothing, books, papers and
notebooks all strewn about in disarray, as well as some comic
books and magazines, including a copy of Scientific American
open to an earmarked article: Tribal Rituals of the Amazon.
The furniture looks as though it were gifted by people with
money or picked up off the street.
There are no pictures, no decorations. It looks less like a
home and more like a crash pad for a man with another life
elsewhere. Lee sees Allerton taking it in. Allerton’s eyes
stop on something poking out from behind a cheap mirror that
leans against the cupboard: a beat up metal tin.
LEE
I’ll fix you a drink.
He goes to the kitchen and grabs two glasses, pouring a
generous amount of Mexican brandy into each.
He goes back to Allerton, hands him one. They clink glasses.
Allerton takes a sip, recoils in disgust.
ALLERTON
Good lord. Napoleon must have
pissed in this one.
LEE
(smiles)
I was afraid of that. An untutored
palate.
(walks over to couch)
(MORE)
33.
LEE (CONT’D)
34.
Your generation has never learned
the pleasures that a trained palate
confers on the disciplined few.
He sits down on the sofa, takes a self-satisfied sip. The
awful brandy catches in his throat and he begins to cough.
LEE (CONT’D)
It is god awful.
Allerton laughs as Lee keeps coughing. Lee gestures for
Allerton to join him on the couch. He starts walking over.
LEE (CONT’D)
Still, better than California
brandy. It has a suggestion of
cognac taste.
Allerton sits down. Lee stops coughing, clears his throat.
Long silence as they both sit there, taking sips of the awful
brandy, neither of them sure what to say or do.
LEE (CONT’D)
Can I show you over the house?
Beat. Allerton looks at him, nods. Lee gets up.
LEE (CONT’D)
Over here we have the bedroom.
Lee walks over there. Allerton gets up slowly, following.
They get to the doorway to the bedroom and Lee hangs there as
Allerton makes his way past Lee over to the bed, sits down
and lights a cigarette. Lee watches him for a moment, then
goes and sits in the sad, lone chair in the room. Beat.
LEE (CONT’D)
More brandy?
Allerton nods. Lee gets up and fetches the bottle. Allerton
just lies there, smoking. Lee comes back and fills both their
glasses. He sits at the edge of the bed. They drink. Silence.
Lee looks over at Allerton. He looks him up and down, reaches
his hand out and touches Allerton’s sweater.
LEE (CONT’D)
Sweet stuff, dearie.
Allerton looks at him as Lee feels the wool.
LEE (CONT’D)
This wasn’t made in Mexico.
LEE (CONT’D)
34.
35.
ALLERTON
(taking a sip)
I bought it in Scotland.
The brandy catches in Allerton’s throat and he starts
coughing wildly. Lee looks at him, concerned.
LEE
Are you all ri --
Allerton gets up and rushes for the bathroom. Immediately, we
can hear him start to vomit. Lee looks off, concerned.
Lee gets up, goes to the kitchen, and fills a glass of water.
When he gets back to the bedroom, Allerton is finishing
washing out his mouth in the sink. Lee watches, tenderly.
Allerton spits out the water, wipes his mouth with his
sleeve.
LEE (CONT’D)
What could be the matter? You
didn’t drink much.
Allerton shrugs. Lee hands him the water. He drinks it all.
LEE (CONT’D)
Are you all right now?
ALLERTON
Yes. I think so.
Beat. He goes and lies back down on the bed. Lee watches as
Allerton slides his shoes off one by one, letting them hit
the floor: clunk, clunk. Beat.
Lee goes and sits on the bed. Allerton looks at him.
Lee reaches out a hand and touches Allerton’s sweater. He
feels the fabric tenderly in his fingers. Allerton reaches
and covers one of Lee’s hands with his own, squeezing it.
LEE
Let’s get this sweater off.
ALLERTON
Okay.
Beat. Allerton takes off the sweater, lays down again. He’s
wearing an oxford underneath.
Slowly, Lee takes off his own shoes and his shirt. He lets
them fall onto the floor.
35.
36.
He opens up Allerton’s shirt and begins to run his hand down
Allerton’s stomach and ribs.
ALLERTON (CONT’D)
That rib’s broken.
Lee nods, runs his hand over it carefully.
Allerton’s muscles contract beneath his fingers.
LEE
God, you’re skinny.
ALLERTON
I’m pretty small.
Lee begins to kiss Allerton’s bare chest. He looks up at
Allerton to see if he likes it. Allerton looks back at him --
there is neither hostility nor disgust but just a surprising,
curious detachment. Lee looks at him, confused but still
excited.
He keeps kissing Allerton’s body, looking into Allerton’s
eyes periodically to check if Allerton wants him to stop, but
Allerton gives him nothing -- he just looks at Lee with the
calm detachment of an animal.
Lee takes off Allerton’s socks. He loosens Allerton’s belt
and unbuttons his trousers.
Allerton arches his body so that Lee can pull the trousers
off. Lee looks at him for a moment, then takes them off. He
(and the audience) see that Allerton’s penis is hard under
his underwear. Lee smiles, drops his own trousers and lies
down besides Allerton, also hard.
Lee looks over Allerton’s body with deep fascination and
excitement. Allerton looks at Lee with the same detachment.
Lee looks into Allerton’s eyes, kisses him, tentatively,
sweetly.
ALLERTON (CONT’D)
Do I smell like vomit?
LEE
No, no.
He kisses him again. Allerton lets him. They kiss for a long
beat until Lee starts kissing his way down Allerton’s body.
Allerton watches as Lee makes it to his crotch, then takes
off his underwear and takes him in his mouth.
36.
37.
Lee looks into Allerton’s eyes periodically to see the effect
he’s having. Allerton just looks at him neither encouraging
nor discouraging, even as his body registers the pleasure,
and, eventually, he comes in Lee’s mouth.
Lee looks into Allerton’s eyes as Allerton finishes coming.
With the same curious look of detachment, Allerton caresses
Lee’s face and, before Lee can swallow, starts pulling his
head back up to his face. Lee, surprised, goes along with it.
He kisses Allerton, mouth still full of Allerton’s cum. They
make out for a long beat.
Lee lies back down next to Allerton. Allerton reaches over
for his cigarettes on the counter, lights one. Lee reaches
for his own cigarettes.
As Lee starts to bring the lighter to his face, Allerton
reaches his hand over and grabs a hold of Lee’s penis. Lee
looks at him, unlit cigarette still in his mouth, flame from
the lighter hanging there. Allerton looks into Lee’s eyes
with the same look of detachment as he starts stroking him.
Lee closes his eyes, flame still burning. Eventually, Lee
comes: the cigarette falls out of his mouth, the lighter
snaps shut. Allerton smiles slightly. Lee looks at him,
flushed, shy.
Allerton reaches over and grabs a piece of Lee’s dirty
laundry, hands it to Lee for him to wipe himself off.
Lee wipes himself, throws the shirt back on the ground, picks
up his cigarette off his chest and finally lights it.
Lee and Allerton lie side by side, naked, smoking. Long beat.
Lee looks over at him, takes in the reality of Allerton’s
naked body next to his. He almost can’t believe it. He knows
he shouldn’t say anything, that he should just let the
silence sit, but he can’t help himself.
LEE (CONT’D)
Oh, by the way...
Allerton looks at him.
LEE (CONT’D)
You said you had a camera in pawn
you were about to lose?
ALLERTON
Yes. In for four hundred pesos. The
ticket runs out next Wednesday.
37.
38.
LEE
Well, let’s go down tomorrow and
get it out.
Beat. Allerton shrugs.
ALLERTON
Okay.
Allerton turns away. Lee just keeps looking at him, already
suspecting he’s said the wrong thing.
EXT. THE STREET OUTSIDE - SAME TIME
The light is on in Lee’s apartment. Plumes of cigarette smoke
pass by the window. The curtains blow slightly in the breeze.
LEE (V.O.)
I know telepathy to be a fact,
since I have experienced it myself.
EXT. MEXICO CITY - LATE NIGHT/EARLY MORNING
Shots of the nocturnal city: men picking up hookers; an old
woman peeing in the street; a stabbing outside a bar.
LEE (V.O.)
I have no interest to prove it, or,
in fact, to prove anything to
anybody.
EXT. THE STREET - ANOTHER DAY, AFTERNOON
Lee and Allerton walk. Lee puts his hand around Allerton’s
shoulder, warmly.
LEE (O.S.)
What interests me is how I can use
it.
Allerton jerks his shoulder away. Lee looks at him,
perturbed, confused. Allerton looks ahead, impenetrable.
INT. K.C. STEAK HOUSE - DAY
The place is mostly empty. Lee drinks a martini, Allerton a
rum and coke. Lee is drunk, talking excitedly.
38.
39.
LEE
In South America, at the headwaters
of the Amazon grows a plant called
Yage that is supposed to increase
telepathic sensitivity. Medicine
men use it in their work. A
Columbian scientist, whose name
escapes me, isolated from Yage a
drug he called Telepathine. I read
all this in a magazine article.
Allerton nods, feigning interest.
LEE (CONT’D)
Later, I see another article: the
Russians are using Yage in
experiments on slave labor. It
seems they want to induce states of
automatic obedience and ultimately,
of course, “thought control.” The
basic con. No buildup, no spiel, no
routine, just move in on someone’s
psyche and give orders.
(laughs)
I have a theory the Mayan priests
developed a form of one-way
telepathy to con the peasants into
doing all the work. The deal is
certain to backfire eventually,
because telepathy is not of its
nature a one-way setup, nor a setup
of sender and receiver at all.
Allerton looks around impatiently, sips his rum and coke.
LEE (CONT’D)
By now, the U.S. is experimenting
with Yage, unless they are dumber
even than I think. Yage might be a
means to usable knowledge of
telepathy. Anything that can be
accomplished chemically can be
accomplished in other ways.
Lee notices Allerton’s disinterest, looks at the menu.
LEE (CONT’D)
How about the T-bone steak for two?
ALLERTON
That’s fine...
39.
40.
LEE
They list baked Alaska here. Ever
eat it?
ALLERTON
No.
LEE
Real good. Hot on the outside and
cold inside.
ALLERTON
That’s why they call it baked
Alaska, I imagine...
Lee looks at Allerton with a mixture of longing and disdain.
Allerton drums his fingers on the table, aloof.
LEE
Got an idea for a new dish: Take a
live pig and throw it into a very
hot oven so the pig is roasted
outside and, when you cut into it,
still alive and twitching inside.
Or, if we run a dramatic joint, a
screaming pig covered with burning
brandy rushes out of the kitchen
and dies right by your chair. You
can reach down and pull off the
crispy, crackly ears and eat them
with your cocktails.
Beat. Finally, Allerton smiles. Lee smiles too, satisfied.
INT. LEE’S APARTMENT - EVENING
They drink the same awful brandy, reading next to each other.
Lee puts his book down and looks at Allerton.
Allerton looks over, sees the longing in his eyes.
ALLERTON
Well, if you insist.
Lee smiles. He kisses Allerton. Allerton kisses him back.
INT. LEE’S APARTMENT - THE NEXT NIGHT
Allerton sits at the table in the living room with his
typewriter, copyediting for a newspaper. Lee cooks chicken
livers in the kitchen.
40.
41.
THE BEDROOM - LATER
Lee and Allerton kiss on Lee’s bed. Lee starts to unbutton
Allerton’s shirt. Allerton stops him.
ALLERTON
I want a rum and coke.
LEE
(laughs)
Sure. Sounds good.
He keeps kissing Allerton, but Allerton stops him.
ALLERTON
Let’s go to the Ship Ahoy.
Allerton gets up and starts putting on his clothes. Lee
watches him, dejected.
As Allerton is putting on his pants, Lee gets up and sweetly,
almost domestic, starts to help Allerton button them.
Allerton freezes, rigid with annoyance.
INT. THE SHIP AHOY - LATER
Allerton sits at a table with Mary, drinking a rum and coke.
Lee sits across the room with Joe Guidry and a YOUNG MAN, but
he’s not paying attention to them. He looks at Allerton,
wounded, angry.
YOUNG MAN
I was treated, you know, by a
therapist in the Army.
JOE GUIDRY
What did you find out?
YOUNG MAN
I found out I was an Oedipus. I
love my mother.
JOE GUIDRY
(laughs)
Everybody loves their mother, son.
YOUNG MAN
I mean I love my mother physically.
JOE GUIDRY
I don’t believe that, son.
41.
42.
Lee laughs bitterly, distant, still looking at Allerton. Joe
turns to Lee.
JOE GUIDRY (CONT’D)
Hey, Lee, did you hear Jim Cochran
has gone back to the States? He
plans to work in Alaska.
Lee takes a long sip of his drink, finally turns to Joe.
LEE
Thank God I am a gentleman of
independent means and don’t have to
expose myself to the inclemencies
of near-Arctic conditions.
At the other end of the bar, Mary and Allerton laugh loudly
about something. Lee looks over, scowls, turns back to Joe.
LEE (CONT’D)
By the way, did you ever meet Jim’s
wife, Alice? My God, she is an
American bitch that won’t quit. I
never yet see her equal. Jim does
not have one friend he can take to
the house. She has forbidden him to
eat out, as she does not want he
should take in any nourishment
unless she is there to watch him
eat it. Did you ever hear of the
likes of that? Needless to say, my
place is out of bounds to Jim, and
he always has that hunted look when
he comes to see me. I don’t know
why American men put up with such
shit from a woman.
Lee looks over, sees that Mary now has her hand on Allerton’s
arm. He downs the rest of his drink.
LEE (CONT’D)
Of course, I am no expert judge of
female flesh, but Alice has “lousy
lay” written all over her scrawny,
unappetizing person.
Lee looks at his empty glass, gestures for another. The Young
Man with Joe looks a bit scandalized.
JOE GUIDRY
You’re coming on mighty bitchy
tonight, Lee...
42.
43.
LEE
Not without reason.
Joe looks at Lee. Lee looks back, shrugs.
LEE (CONT’D)
Never mind. I’ve got bigger fish to
fry.
He glances over again at Allerton and Mary, laughing again.
JOE GUIDRY
Fish is right. Cold, slippery, and
hard to catch.
INT. HALLWAY IN A BOARDING HOUSE - LATE MORNING
Lee knocks on a door. Beat. No response.
He knocks again. No response.
He knocks a third time. The door swings open. Allerton stands
there, naked, annoyed, still groggy.
Lee looks at Allerton’s body. Allerton doesn’t greet him,
just goes and starts to get dressed.
INT. NATIONAL PAWN SHOP - LATER
Lee and Allerton stand in front of a disinterested OFFICIAL.
OFFICIAL
Boleto?
Lee looks at Allerton. Allerton shakes his head.
OFFICIAL (CONT’D)
Necesita su boleto.
Allerton sighs.
LEE
No. No boleto. He lost it. Perdido.
OFFICIAL
Ah... I’m sorry. You need the
ticket.
LEE
(pointing at something
behind the official.)
But --
43.
44.
Official turns and yells something to his SUPERVISOR. Lee and
Allerton stand there annoyed as the two Mexicans have a
conversation about protocol. Finally, SUPERVISOR comes over.
SUPERVISOR
Necesita --
LEE
(pointing)
It’s right there.
Supervisor looks at him, confused.
LEE (CONT’D)
Alla. There. We can see it.
Supervisor looks behind him, sees a camera on the shelf. He
looks back at Lee.
SUPERVISOR
Necesita --
Lee slaps a few hundred peso bills on the counter.
Supervisor looks at the money, then at Lee.
SUPERVISOR (CONT’D)
A ver, permítame.
EXT. THE STREET - LATER
Lee and Allerton walk, still silent. Allerton has the camera
around his neck. Lee looks over at Allerton to see if he’s
happy. Allerton just looks bored, annoyed.
INT. SHIP AHOY - LATER, DAY
Lee has a drink. Allerton doesn’t. The camera sits on the
table between them.
LEE
How about dinner?
Allerton looks at him, then down at the camera on the table.
ALLERTON
I think I’ll work tonight.
Lee looks hurt. He laughs, attempting a joke.
44.
45.
LEE
Like the Wallace administration, I
subsidize non-production.
Allerton looks at him blank. Lee spells it out for him:
LEE (CONT’D)
I will pay you twenty pesos not to
work tonight.
Allerton doesn’t react. Lee opens his mouth to continue when
Allerton looks up at him, completely cold, stopping Lee in
his tracks. He looks at Allerton with shocked, hurt eyes.
Allerton looks back, perturbed, then looks away, drums on the
table, irritable, looking around.
LEE (CONT’D)
(tentatively)
How about a drink?
ALLERTON
No... Not now.
(gets up, abruptly)
Anyway, I have to go.
Lee gets up jerkily.
LEE
Well... I’ll see you tomorrow?
ALLERTON
Yes. Good night.
He starts to go.
LEE
Eugene --
He stops. Lee looks at the camera Allerton left on the table.
Coldly, Allerton goes and picks it up, leaves. Lee watches
him go. He feels behind him for the back of his chair and
lowers himself into it like a man weak from illness.
INT. SHIP AHOY - HOURS LATER
Lee sits, alone, now very drunk, empty glasses all around.
The door opens at the other end of the bar: Allerton enters
with Mary. Lee looks over at them.
Allerton waves at Lee vaguely, then heads out the door into
the alleyway behind the bar with Mary.
45.
46.
Lee watches them go. He downs his drink and gets up, wobbly.
EXT. ALLEYWAY - CONTINUOUS
Lee exits into the alleyway. One end leads out into the
street, the other has a staircase that leads up to the
apartment on top of the bar where the owners live. Lee leans
against the wall, takes a piss, then starts wobbling up the
staircase.
INT. THE APARTMENT UPSTAIRS - CONTINUOUS
Lee stumbles into a small gathering. A record plays on the
turntable. People are sipping drinks, smoking cigarettes,
talking in small groups.
Joe Guidry is there making out in a corner, hot and heavy,
with TWO BEAUTIFUL YOUNG MEN, switching between them.
One group is laughing, gathered around a VERY DRUNK MAN
balancing a shot glass on his head a la William Tell. ANOTHER
DRUNK MAN, drinking straight from a bottle of Oso Negro gin,
throws olives at the glass, trying to knock it over -- the
olives keep hitting the guy in the face.
Dume is there, talking with someone. He looks over and sees
Lee wobbling around the party, and he not-so-subtly nudges
his companion to look. They both laugh, hands in front of
their mouths.
Lee sees them, but he’s too wasted and too single-minded to
care. He keeps moving, making his way to Allerton, who is
speaking with Tom Weston near a window.
LEE
(slurs)
I wanna talk to you --
Allerton and Tom look at him, clocking that he’s drunk.
LEE (CONT’D)
I wanna speak... without speaking.
Lee laughs. Tom puts a hand on his shoulder.
LEE (CONT’D)
I wanna touch you... like the
Russians...
(laughs)
The Mayans...
46.
47.
TOM WESTON
(easing Lee into a chair)
All right. Easy does it, Bill...
Lee laughs, caresses Tom’s face sweetly.
LEE
You got anything to drink, Tom? I
could use a couple.
Lee closes his eyes and blacks out. The last thing he sees is
Allerton looking at him, the same cold look of detachment.
BLACK. Then...
EXT. ALLEYWAY BEHIND THE SHIP AHOY - NEITHER DAY NOR NIGHT,
UNMOORED FROM TIME
Lee suddenly stands in front of the bar which looks deserted.
He looks around, confused, unsettled.
Down the road, he sees a man -- HIMSELF -- standing at a
knife sharpening bicycle, waiting as the sharpener works.
Faintly, Lee hears the sound of crying. He looks to his right
and sees a TINY BABY on the ground in the street with his
exact face - his son.
He kneels down and takes the baby in his arms. The baby’s
sobs become louder. Lee, without thinking, starts crying too,
his body shaking with sobs.
He looks up and sees SEVERAL PEOPLE in convict suits suddenly
standing there, watching him: Mary, Joe Guidry, Tom Weston,
Winston Moor, John Dumé, Allerton. Lee looks at them all,
confused. He looks curiously back down at the crying baby,
who is now embedded in his thigh.
INT. LEE’S BEDROOM - MIDDLE OF THE DAY
Lee looks around, suddenly in his own bedroom, not
remembering how he got there, seeing the detritus of a bender
all around him.
INT. BATHROOM
Lee rummages through a cupboard, looking for something. He
finds it -- a tin of throat lozenges. He opens it up and
looks inside: there are a few pieces of opium. He takes one
out and looks at it. He eats it. Beat. He eats another.
47.
48.
EXT. SHIP AHOY - EVENING
Lee pulls up in a cab across the street. He pays the cabbie,
gets out and starts walking towards the bar.
Allerton is outside, smoking a cigarette.
Lee sees him. He nervously approaches. Allerton looks up. Lee
smiles. Allerton smiles back, friendly.
LEE
How are you?
ALLERTON
Sleepy. Just got up.
He yawns. Lee looks like he’s about to say something else --
ALLERTON (CONT’D)
See you.
He heads into the bar. Lee just stands there.
INT. THE SHIP AHOY - LATER
Allerton sits at a table alone with a chess board in front of
him, waiting for Mary and the Peruvian Man, who are ordering
at the bar. Lee sits alone at another table, watching him,
almost finished with his third drink.
Lee reaches into his pocket, eats a piece of opium and washes
it down with the rest of his drink. He goes over and sits at
the table with Allerton. Allerton looks up at him.
LEE
I figure to go down to South
America soon. Why don’t you come
along? Won’t cost you a cent.
Allerton looks him over.
ALLERTON
Perhaps not in money.
Lee smiles.
LEE
I’m not a difficult man to get
along with. We could reach a
satisfactory arrangement. What you
got to lose?
48.
49.
ALLERTON
Independence.
LEE
So who’s going to cut in on your
independence? You can lay all the
women in South America if you want
to.
Allerton laughs.
LEE (CONT’D)
All I ask is be nice to Papa,
say... twice a week? That isn’t
excessive is it?
He looks at Allerton. Allerton can’t tell if he’s serious.
LEE (CONT’D)
Besides, I’ll buy you a round trip
ticket so you can leave at your
discretion.
Long beat. Lee searches Allerton’s face.
ALLERTON
I’ll think it over.
Lee’s face brightens with hope.
ALLERTON (CONT’D)
This newspaper job I’m doing runs
ten days more... I’ll give you a
definite answer when the job folds.
LEE
(laughs condescendingly)
Your job...
He considers saying something mean -- he stops himself.
LEE (CONT’D)
All right.
Mary and the Peruvian return with drinks. Lee looks up at
Mary, who looks back at him apprehensive, disdainful.
Lee gets up, mock gentlemanly and apologetic, and gestures
for Mary to take her seat back. He goes.
49.
50.
INT. LEE’S APARTMENT - THAT NIGHT
Lee looks around for something, agitated, impatient. He finds
it behind the cheap mirror that leans against the cupboard:
the beat up metal tin that Allerton noticed earlier.
Lee takes it out and opens it, revealing it to be a heroin
kit. He lays it all out on the bed, shoots up, and lies down,
high.
INT. SHIP AHOY - THE NEXT DAY
Allerton stands at the bar. Lee comes and stands next to him.
LEE
So?
Allerton looks at him blankly.
LEE (CONT’D)
Have you thought it over? The trip?
ALLERTON
I can’t decide until I come back
from Morelia.
LEE
Morelia?
ALLERTON
A few of my coworkers from the
newspaper office and I are going.
Just for three days. We leave
tomorrow. I’ll let you know about
South America when I get back.
Lee looks at him, hurt and anger bubbling under the surface.
Allerton gets up and walks away. Lee takes out four
Benzedrine tablets from his pocket and swallows them, washing
them down with his drink.
INT. SHIP AHOY - LATER
Lee is now very high, still sitting alone, drinking. He looks
over and notices a BARTENDER holding up a mouse by its tail
away from his body, trying to bring it outside. The mouse
writhes and wriggles as the other patrons watch, laughing.
50.
51.
LEE
(slurring)
Hold the son of a bitch out and
I’ll blast it!
Everyone looks over at Lee. He gets his pistol out, pointing
it at the mouse. A few people laugh, a few look on concerned.
BARTENDER
No, senor. Por favor.
Lee cocks the gun.
LEE
Hold that little fucker out! Come
on!
BARTENDER
Okay, okay. Como usted diga.
The bartender ties a piece of string around the mouse’s tail
and holds him out at arm’s length. Lee steps up so that he’s
only three feet from the mouse. He holds out his gun
dramatically as if he were in a duel. The rest of the patrons
laugh, a few cheer as Lee dramatically takes aim and pulls
the trigger.
BAM!
The shot rings out loudly through the space as the mouse’s
head explodes. Bartender gets covered in blood and mouse-
guts. The bullet hits the leg of a chair and ricochets
slightly. Everyone ducks and jumps up. Lee bows.
TOM WESTON
If you got any closer, the mouse
would’ve clogged the muzzle.
Lee shrugs, goes over to the bar.
LEE
Coffee.
The other bartender hands him a coffee. Lee reaches into his
coat pocket, takes out a small piece of opium and eats it,
washing it down with the coffee.
The door to the bar opens and John Dumé walks in. Lee looks
over and sees him.
LEE (CONT’D)
Dumé!
51.
52.
Dumé looks at him, curiously. He can tell that Lee’s
plastered. He smirks.
LEE (CONT’D)
I wanna talk to you.
Dumé walks over there.
JOHN DUMÉ
Are we enjoying ourselves, Bill?
LEE
You took our friend Allerton to
some queer bars, huh?
Dumé looks at him blankly.
LEE (CONT’D)
Gene. Eugene Allerton.
JOHN DUMÉ
Oh. (sighs.)
Yes, I did.
Dumé gestures to the bartender for a drink. Lee looks at him.
JOHN DUMÉ (CONT’D)
Most boring night of my life. I
took him to the Green Lantern. The
whole time, he just sat there like:
Dumé does an impression of Allerton’s blank stare.
JOHN DUMÉ (CONT’D)
All night, just:
Again, he does the stare. Lee recognizes it.
JOHN DUMÉ (CONT’D)
Finally, I say to him: “Are you
having a bad time, kid? Would you
like to go home?” He goes:
(Allerton impression.)
“No. This is fine.”
Dumé’s beer arrives. He sips it, laughs.
JOHN DUMÉ (CONT’D)
God help whoever’s trying to crack
that nut.
(looks at Lee.)
Oh God, you’re not making it with
him, are you?
52.
53.
Lee doesn’t say anything. Dumé looks at him, mock
sympathetic.
JOHN DUMÉ (CONT’D)
You’ve got enough problems already,
don’t you think, Bill?
Dumé puts his hand on Lee’s shoulder. Lee shakes him off.
Dumé smiles, shrugs.
JOHN DUMÉ (CONT’D)
Suit yourself. I gotta take a leak.
Dumé gets up and heads for the bathroom, leaving his beer.
Lee watches him go. When he’s fully gone, Lee turns and spits
in Dumé’s beer. He turns back to his own beer and sips it,
deep in thought.
INT. SHIP AHOY - A FEW DAYS LATER
Lee and Allerton sit, drinking cocktails in the afternoon.
LEE
So...
Allerton looks up at him.
LEE (CONT’D)
How was Morelia?
ALLERTON
Oh... it was all right.
Allerton looks down at his drink, aloof, impenetrable. Lee
feels a charge of anger pass through his body.
LEE
You know, I’m thinking about buying
a half interest in this place.
Allerton looks up at him.
LEE (CONT’D)
You exist on credit here, right?
Tom says you owe 400 pesos.
Allerton shrugs.
LEE (CONT’D)
Maybe, if I were half owner of the
joint, you wouldn’t be in a
position to ignore me.
53.
54.
Allerton just looks at him for a long beat. Lee looks back.
Allerton laughs, shakes his head. Lee looks down, ashamed.
Allerton drums on the table with his thin hands. Lee looks
down at them.
LEE (CONT’D)
What about this trip to South
America?
Beat. Allerton stops drumming on the table, shrugs.
ALLERTON
It’s always nice to see places you
haven’t seen before...
Lee’s face brightens.
LEE
Can you leave anytime?
ALLERTON
Anytime.
Allerton looks at Lee. Lee looks back at him, hardly able to
contain his excitement. Allerton laughs at him.
EXT. BUS DEPOT - A FEW DAYS LATER
Allerton and Lee are lined up to board the bus. Lee holds an
envelope overflowing with bus tickets, train tickets, visas.
He’s talking excitedly.
LEE
We may have to trek back into the
jungle to find the Yage. When we
get where the Yage is, we’ll dig a
hip cat and ask him: “Where can we
score for Yage?”
ALLERTON
How will you know where to look?
LEE
I aim to find that out in Bogota. A
Colombian scientist who lives in
Bogota isolated Telepathine from
Yage. We must find that scientist.
Allerton smiles, amused. Lee registers this, satisfied.
54.
55.
INT. A CROWDED BUS - LATER, SUNSET
Allerton and Lee sit next to each other. Allerton looks out
the open window at the sun setting over Mexico.
He feels something and looks down, sees that Lee has his hand
on his thigh. Allerton looks at Lee’s hand for a second. He
picks it up, puts it on Lee’s thigh, and looks back out the
window. Lee doesn’t care. He just looks contentedly at
Allerton sitting next him.
INT. HOTEL ROOM IN PANAMA CITY - NIGHT
Lee sits on his bed watching Allerton brush his teeth.
Allerton finishes, gargles and starts to enter the room,
stopping in the doorway. He sees how Lee is looking at him.
ALLERTON
What?
Lee gestures to the space next to him. Allerton turns off the
light in the bathroom and goes and sits on his own bed,
getting ready to sleep.
LEE
We had a deal didn’t we? Twice a
week?
They look at each other for a long beat. Allerton shrugs and
goes to Lee on his bed. He sits down.
Lee looks at him, nervous, excited.
Allerton reaches his hand out and puts it on Lee’s crotch.
Lee shudders. Allerton strokes him over his pants until Lee
gets hard. Lee reaches out to touch Allerton, but before he
can, Allerton bends down and takes Lee in his mouth.
Lee smiles as Allerton goes down on him.
INT. CURIO STORE - THE NEXT DAY
Allerton waits as Lee cashes a travelers check and buys a
hat, talking with the CLERK. Lee is shaking slightly.
CLERK
What did you say it was you’re
looking for down here?
LEE
Not here. In Columbia. Yage.
55.
56.
CLERK
Never heard of that.
LEE
You heard of H and C?
Clerk looks at him.
LEE (CONT’D)
Heroin and Cocaine.
CLERK
Oh. (laughs.)
You can get those in the city.
EXT. BARS/HOTELS/WHOREHOUSES AROUND PANAMA CITY - LATER
Lee and Allerton walk around looking to score.
EXT. PHARMACY - LATER
Lee waits outside, rolling a small joint with some cheap pot:
all sad-looking shake, no bud. As he lights it, Allerton
emerges from the pharmacy with a paper bag. He takes out a
bottle of paregoric. Lee looks at it, eyes wide. On the
bottle, it says: “Camphorated tincture of opium, for
treatment of diarrhea.” Lee smiles, cracks open the bottle.
INT. A BAR - LATER
Allerton dozes off, exhausted. Lee finishes off the last
drops of the bottle of paregoric, takes out a little baggie
of white powder and dips his pinkie inside, tastes the
contents. He shrugs, pours a little out onto the table and
snorts it.
INT. PLANE FROM PANAMA TO QUITO, ECUADOR - A FEW DAYS LATER
Allerton looks out the window. Lee sits shivering slightly.
INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
The room looks a hundred years old: high ceilings with black
beams and white plaster walls. They sit on their beds, cold.
Lee shivers, junk sick. Allerton looks at him, concerned.
56.
57.
INT. DRUG STORE IN TOWN - THE NEXT DAY
Lee still shivers. Allerton tries talking to the pharmacist.
PHARMACIST
Necesita una receta.
ALLERTON
Tengo dinero.
Allerton starts reaching into his pocket.
PHARMACIST
(holding up prescription)
Receta. Necesita una receta médica.
Allerton sighs. Pharmacist looks over at Lee.
PHARMACIST (CONT’D)
Tiene diarrea?
Lee looks at her, eyes pouty, trying to seem extra pathetic.
LEE
Si. Mucho diarrea.
Pharmacist looks at him, sympathetic but suspicious.
LEE (CONT’D)
Paregoric es la medicacion mejor
para mi.
Beat. She disappears for a moment -- Lee and Allerton look at
each other, hopeful. She returns and plops something on the
counter: a box of Tums. Lee deflates.
EXT. QUITO, MAIN SQUARE - LATER
A cold wind from the mountains blows trash through the dirty
streets as Lee and Allerton walk by some GLOOMY PEOPLE with
blankets wrapped round their faces. Lee is shivering -- his
junk sickness has gotten worse. Allerton helps him along the
road. He looks as they pass a ROW OF HIDEOUS OLD HAGS huddled
along the wall of a church. Lee keeps shivering badly.
INT. THE HOTEL ROOM - LATER, NIGHT
Lee and Allerton smoke a joint on the balcony. Lee is wrapped
in blankets, shivering, looking out at Quito.
57.
(MORE)
58.
LEE
Tibet must be about like this. High
and cold and full of ugly looking
people and llamas and yaks. Yak
milk for breakfast, yak curds for
lunch, and for dinner a yak boiled
in his own butter...
(takes a drag, passes)
You can smell one of them holy men
ten miles downwind on a clear day.
Sitting there pulling on his old
prayer wheel so nasty. Wrapped in
dirty burlap sacks, with bedbugs
crawling around where his neck
sticks out of the sack. His nose is
all rotted away, and he spits betel
nut out through the hose holes like
a spitting cobra... The old “wisdom-
of-the-East” routine.
ALLERTON
(takes a drag)
Wisdom of the East?
LEE
So we got like, a holy man, and
some bitch reporter comes to
interview him. He sits there
chewing on his betel nut. After a
while, he says to one of his
acolytes: “Go down to the Sacred
Well and bring me a dipper of
paregoric. I’m going to make with
the wisdom of the East. And shake
the lead outta your loin cloth!”
Allerton laughs, smoking.
LEE (CONT’D)
So he drinks the P.G. And goes into
a light trance and makes cosmic
contact -- we call it going on the
nod in the trade. The reporter
says: “Will there be war with
Russia, Mahatma? Will Communism
destroy the civilized world? Is the
soul immortal? Does God exist?” The
Mahatma opens his eyes and
compresses his lips and spits two
long red streams of betel nut juice
out through his nose holes.
(MORE)
58.
LEE (CONT’D)
59.
It runs down over his mouth, and he
licks it back in with a long,
coated tongue and says: “How the
fuck should I know?” The acolyte
says: “You heard the man. Now cut.
The Swami wants to be alone with
his medications.”
(takes a drag, smiles)
Come to think of it, that is the
wisdom of the East. The Westerner
thinks there is some secret he can
discover. The East says: “How the
fuck should I know?”
Lee finishes the joint, stubs it out on the railing, shivers.
LEE (CONT’D)
Fuck, it’s cold out here.
INT. THE HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
Lee and Allerton lie in separate beds. Lee tosses and turns.
He wakes up with a start from a nightmare, instantly cold.
LEE
(whispers)
Are you awake, Gene?
ALLERTON
(groggy, just barely half-
awake)
Yes.
LEE
Cold?
ALLERTON
Yes.
LEE
Can I come over with you?
Beat.
ALLERTON
All right.
Lee gets out of his bed and gets into bed with Allerton. He
is shaking.
ALLERTON (CONT’D)
You’re twitching all over.
LEE (CONT’D)
59.
60.
Lee presses against Allerton. The junk sickness makes him
horny: Allerton can feel Lee’s erection poking into his back
as Lee starts to feel Allerton’s body.
ALLERTON (CONT’D)
Christ almighty, your hands are
cold.
Lee smiles. He keeps caressing Allerton, feeling him up,
until Allerton shakes him off and curls up, falling asleep.
Lee lies there, shivering.
Allerton rolls over and throws his knee across Lee’s body.
Lee’s whole body tenses. He tries to lie absolutely still so
as to not wake Allerton and have him move away.
He just looks at Allerton’s knee, feeling it on his body,
breathing heavy, trying not to shiver. He looks up to
Allerton’s face: behind his closed eyelids, the eyes flutter
with activity. Lee’s eyelids start to become heavy, and he
too drifts off the sleep.
INT. LEE’S APARTMENT (DREAM)
We see Lee’s POV sitting at a table: Allerton sits across
from him.
Slowly, Allerton starts to slide his hands out in front of
him on the table. So does Lee until their hands are very
close but not touching -- there is just the slightest space
between them.
Allerton looks at Lee’s face, registering surprise, concern
ALLERTON
What’s wrong?
INT. THE HOTEL ROOM - SAME TIME
Lee, still dreaming, eyes closed, shakes his head slightly
and mouths, almost inaudibly.
LEE
Nothing...
We pan to Allerton, also dreaming, eyes closed, who scrunches
his face as if he too is disturbed by something.
60.
61.
INT. LEE’S APARTMENT (DREAM)
We see that Allerton and Lee are sharing the same dream
space. We see Allerton’s POV of Lee sitting across from him.
Lee is looking down at the space between their hands.
We leave Allerton’s POV and see them from the side of the
table, sitting across from each other.
Hovering just slightly above the table, a thin, almost
translucent piece of white paper hangs in the space between
Lee and Allerton -- they both look at it, then at each other
through the paper, as if holding it hovering in the space
between their minds.
They stare at each other, curiously, almost weightless: it’s
as if, faintly, they can both tell that they are dreaming
together. It’s at once terrifying and exhilarating.
INT. THE HOTEL ROOM - SAME TIME
They lie next to each other, perfectly still, neither daring
to move a muscle, Allerton’s leg still slung over Lee’s body,
both dreaming the same dream.
EXT. STREETS OF QUITO - THE NEXT DAY
Allerton walks a very sick Lee through hilly, narrow streets.
INT. DOCTOR’S OFFICE
Inside a yellow stucco villa, Lee sits on an exam table.
Allerton sits nearby. A DOCTOR, 60s, Jewish, who speaks good
English, is closing the curtain to the exam room, looking at
Lee’s intake forms as he readies the room.
DOCTOR
Dysentery?
Lee nods.
DOCTOR (CONT’D)
Can you describe your symptoms?
LEE
Bloody diarrhea, cramps,
vomiting...
ALLERTON
High temperature.
61.
62.
LEE
Right. High temperature.
Doctor puts down his clipboard and reaches out his hand to
feel Lee’s forehead.
He looks at Lee suspiciously for a moment, then gets up to go
write a prescription. Lee and Allerton exchange looks.
LEE (CONT’D)
The, uh, the prescription that
works best is paregoric with
bismuth.
Doctor stops writing. Beat. He laughs, gives Lee a long look.
DOCTOR
Tell the truth now. Are you
addicted to opiates?
Lee opens his mouth to protest.
DOCTOR (CONT’D)
Better you tell me. Otherwise, I
cannot help you.
Beat.
LEE
Yes.
DOCTOR
Ah ha!
He crumples up the prescription, drops it in the wastebasket.
DOCTOR (CONT’D)
How long has this addiction lasted?
LEE
(faking shame)
Too long, sir... It’s why I left
the States. My condition makes me a
criminal there.
DOCTOR
(shakes his head)
You must stop this habit. Better
you should suffer now than lose
your life.
62.
63.
LEE
I want to stop. But I have to get
some sleep. I’m going to the coast
tomorrow, to Manta.
Doctor sits down in his chair and gives Lee a long,
sympathetic, self-satisfied, human look.
DOCTOR
You must stop this habit.
Lee nods, faking appreciativeness. Allerton smiles to
himself: he can see the annoyance behind Lee’s eyes.
Finally, Doctor gets up and goes to his prescription pad. He
starts writing something as Lee looks on, hopeful.
Doctor comes back and hands Lee the prescription: three CCs
of tincture. Lee looks up at the doctor, nakedly disdainful.
Doctor smiles down at him, magnanimous.
INT. PHARMACY - LATER
PHARMACISTS examine Lee’s prescription, talking amongst
themselves. One of them shakes her head. The other goes to
get something in the back. Lee watches, deflated.
Finally, the pharmacist comes back and plops down a bottle of
paregoric on the counter. Lee’s eyes widen.
LADY PHARMACIST
No tenemos tincture. Paregoric esta
bien?
Lee nods, excited. Pharmacist measures out three CCs, a tiny
amount, into a vial, and she hands it to Lee. He looks at it.
LEE
That’s it?
LADY PHARMACIST
Si. Tres CCs.
LEE
Right, but the doctor made a
mistake. He meant --
LADY PHARMACIST
(pointing to prescription)
Mire. Aquí.
Lee scowls. He looks over at the shelf, grabs a bottle of
antihistamines and plops it on the counter.
63.
64.
LEE
What about this shit? Do I need a
prescription for this shit?
Pharmacist shakes her head. Lee angrily gets out his wallet.
INT. AIRPLANE - THE NEXT DAY
Lee and Allerton ride on a small propeller plane to Manta.
Allerton sleeps. Lee empties out a handful of antihistamine
pills and downs them with his rum and coke.
INT. BEACH BUNGALOW - THE NEXT NIGHT
The place is made of split bamboo and rough boards. Lee,
still a bit sick, is plugging up the holes in the wall of
their room with paper. Allerton watches.
LEE
You don’t want to get deported
under a cloud... I’m still a little
junk sick, you know, and that makes
me sooo sexy. The neighbors could
witness some innaresting sights.
Allerton smiles. Lee goes to Allerton on the bed, starts to
kiss his body.
ALLERTON
I wish to register a complaint
concerning breach of contract.
Lee looks at him.
ALLERTON (CONT’D)
You said twice a week.
LEE
So I did.
Beat. He starts kissing Allerton’s body again.
LEE (CONT’D)
Well, of course, the contract is
more or less... elastic, you might
say... But you are right...
He grabs hold of Allerton’s penis. Allerton is aroused.
LEE (CONT’D)
Twice a week it is, sire.
64.
65.
He starts stroking Allerton.
LEE (CONT’D)
Of course, if you get hot pants
between times, don’t hesitate to
let me know...
Lee starts to kiss his way towards Allerton’s ear.
ALLERTON
I’ll give you... a buzz...
Lee takes the ear in his mouth. Allerton groans.
EXT. THE OCEAN - THE NEXT DAY
Allerton and Lee swim in swim trunks together in the water.
We follow them as they dive under the water.
THE BEACH
They sit, wearing their trunks, looking at the sea. Lee has
stopped shivering.
Allerton gets out his camera from his backpack -- the one he
and Lee picked up earlier from the pawn office -- and takes a
picture of a boat in the water. Lee notices this, smiles.
EXT. BEACH BUNGALOW - LATER
Lee and Allerton sit watching the sunset -- it turns the
whole bay red. Allerton looks Lee over.
ALLERTON
You seem better.
Lee takes out the bottle of antihistamines and shakes a few
more out into his hand.
LEE
These have cut my junk sickness to
something more like a vague
malaise. I wouldn’t even notice if
I didn’t know what it was.
Allerton laughs. Lee downs the pills with water. He lays his
head down on Allerton’s lap. Allerton lets him, but doesn’t
touch him. He just keeps looking out at the bay. Lee studies
his face.
65.
66.
LEE (CONT’D)
While we’re in Ecuador, we must
score for Yage.
Allerton shrugs.
LEE (CONT’D)
Think of it: thought control. Take
anyone apart and rebuild to your
taste. Anything about somebody bugs
you, you say: “Yage! I want that
routine took clear out of his
mind.”
(smiles.)
I could think of a few changes I
might make in you doll. You’d be so
much nicer after a few alterations.
Allerton looks down at him, impenetrable.
LEE (CONT’D)
You’re nice now, of course, but you
do have those irritating little
peculiarities.
(off Allerton’s look)
I mean, you won’t do exactly what I
want you to do all the time.
ALLERTON
Do you think there is anything in
it, really?
LEE
(shrugs)
The Russians seem to think so. I
understand Yage is the most
efficient confession drug. They’ve
also used peyote. Ever try it?
Allerton shakes his head, looks back out at the bay.
LEE (CONT’D)
Horrible stuff. I had nightmares
after using it, one after the
other. In one dream I had rabies
and looked in the mirror and my
face changed and I began howling.
Another dream I had a chlorophyll
habit. Me and five other
chlorophyll addicts are waiting to
score. We turn green and we can’t
kick the chlorophyll habit. One
shot and you are hung for life. We
are turning into plants.
66.
67.
Lee sees Allerton’s lack of engagement, frowns.
LEE (CONT’D)
Anyway, much as I dislike the idea,
I will have to go back to Quito and
talk to a botanist at the Botanical
Institute there. They might be able
to tell me where in Ecuador I can
find the Yage.
ALLERTON
I’m not going back to Quito for
anything.
Lee smiles. He reaches for the antihistamines, pops a few in
his mouth, then looks up at Allerton, caressing his face.
LEE
No need for you to go. After we go
to Guayaqil, I’ll go back to Quito
and then meet you in Salinas. You
enjoy the beach. Papa will go and
get the info.
Allerton looks at Lee, then back out at the sunset. Lee just
keeps looking at Allerton, caressing his face: Allerton
doesn’t stop him, but he also doesn’t react. Lee stares at
Allerton’s face, searching. Finally, Allerton brushes Lee’s
hand away. Lee deflates, looks out at the sunset.
EXT. MANTA AIRPORT - NEXT DAY
A tiny plane takes off from a dirt runway.
EXT. GUAYAQUIL, ECUADOR - DAY
Shots of the strange city: parks full of tropical trees,
shrubs, vines; a curiously mixed populace: Black, Chinese,
Indian, European, Arab. Large iguanas roam around everywhere.
EXT. TRAIN TRACK/BRIDGE/RIVER - DAY
Lee walks, drinking a soda, looking around at the city. The
shoreline is full of garbage and stray animals. Lee passes
under telephone poles stacked with power cables.
He slows to watch a group of BOYS hanging around a heap of
rubbish. One pees against a telephone pole, smiling at the
others. He turns and notices Lee, still pissing. So do the
others.
67.
68.
Lee doesn’t avert his gaze. He just stares at them openly,
yearningly: it’s not sexual, but it’s full of longing.
The boys start to whisper to themselves, laughing at Lee. Lee
doesn’t move. He just stares at them.
He focuses on the boy who was pissing. It’s as if the world
around him goes out of focus, blacks out. The boy is looking
at him, grinning with sharp white teeth. Lee looks at his
tattered shirt, glimpsing the thin body underneath.
As his gaze goes back up to the boy’s face, we see that he is
no longer grinning. He looks at Lee as if understanding
something. Lee looks back, then looks down at the boy’s
heart. He feels it pounding. Lee’s heart pounds too, in
rhythm with the boy’s. He can feel himself in the boy’s body
across this divide. And then... something clicks.
Like the rush of a shot of heroin, Lee is overtaken by a
flash of fragmentary memories -- the boy’s memories:
FLASH:
- Cocoa beans drying in the sun.
FLASH:
- Walking through the hallways of bamboo tenements.
FLASH:
- Playing with other boys in the warm, dirty river.
FLASH:
- Rummaging through rubbish heaps on the outskirts of town.
And then, suddenly, curiously, Lee is overtaken by his own
memories, interspersed with the boy’s:
FLASH:
-Age 8, sitting in class at the Community School in St.
Louis, not paying attention to the teacher explaining
multiplication tables; instead, writing a ten-page “novel,”
The Autobiography of a Wolf.
68.
69.
FLASH:
-Age 10, standing next to his mother at an arts and antiques
show, watching curiously as she talks with TWO GAY MEN,
antiques dealers. Young Lee studies them: one flamboyant man
puts his arm around the waist of the other.
Then, quickly, overwhelmingly:
FLASH:
-Age 25, walking through the West Village in New York, with
his arm around the waist of an 18-year-old boy, JACK, clearly
smitten, obsessed.
FLASH:
-That night, Making love to Jack in his apartment.
FLASH:
-The next night, looking through a tiny hole in the wall,
watching Jack fooling around with a woman in his own
apartment next door. They laugh, undressing, playful as Lee
fills with rage and resentment.
FLASH:
-The next morning, sitting by the window, no sleep, holding
his pinkie finger between the blades of a pair of poultry
shears. Holding. Holding. Then SLICING a portion of the
finger clear off, blacking out from the pain as he stares
directly into the sun.
SNAP TO:
INT. DINGY NEW YORK APARTMENT - SOME OTHER TIME
The blinding sun is replaced by a dim candle, illuminating
just the upper half of a WOMAN’s naked body which rotates
slowly on a table. The undulating light from the candle
flutters across her as she spins.
An arm enters frame to touch her, then another: Lee’s arms.
We see that they are now full of track marks.
The woman’s arms are also full of track marks. The two of
them have just shot up -- heroin accessories on the table.
69.
70.
The woman laughs as Lee’s hands caress her. She looks at Lee,
at us, with a funny expression.
WOMAN
Aren’t you queer?
We shake our head.
LEE (O.S.)
I’m not queer... I’m disembodied.
The woman smiles. She leans in to kiss us, full of desire.
SNAP BACK TO:
EXT. A LITTLE PARK OVERLOOKING THE CITY - LATER
Lee, smoking, walks up to a park with a view of Guayaquil. A
monument depicts the Guayaquil Conference: big, serious
looking stone columns with a statue in the center showing
Simon Bolivar shaking hands with San Martin De Los Andes. The
two historical men are meant to look dignified, noble.
Lee stops and looks at the statue along with a few somber,
serious-looking TOURISTS and LOCALS who take pictures.
He studies the posture of the men in the statue, the way they
hold each other’s hands, the faces. He focuses on the gaze
between the two of them. He laughs, seeing it. Perhaps we see
it too: the two men look queer -- so queer it rocks you.
People look over at Lee disapprovingly, but he doesn’t care.
He keeps laughing, smoking. To the horror of those around
him, he stubs out his cigarette on Bolivar’s bronze dick.
INT. BOARDING HOUSE - AFTERNOON
Allerton lies asleep in the bed, having an intense dream. Lee
enters and looks at him. He sits down, shakes Allerton
gently. Allerton groans.
LEE
It’s three o’clock, Gene. Time to
get up.
ALLERTON
What for?
LEE
You want to spend your life in bed?
Allerton looks at him, groggy, annoyed.
70.
71.
LEE (CONT’D)
Come on out and dig the town with
me. I saw some beautiful boys on
the waterfront. The real uncut
stuff. Such teeth, such smiles.
Young bodies vibrating with life.
ALLERTON
All right. Stop drooling.
LEE
(sincere)
What have they got that I want,
Gene? Do you know?
ALLERTON
No.
Allerton wraps the blanket back around himself and tries to
go back to sleep. Lee just stares ahead, perturbed.
LEE
They have maleness of course. So
have I. I want myself the same way
I want others... I can’t use my own
body for some reason.
Lee looks down at Allerton’s body, curiously. He starts to
reach his hand out towards him. Allerton opens one eye and
sees Lee reaching, shifts his body away.
LEE (CONT’D)
What’s the matter?
ALLERTON
I thought you were going to run
your hand down my ribs.
LEE
I wouldn’t do that. Think I’m queer
or something?
ALLERTON
Frankly, yes.
Lee smiles. So does Allerton. Lee lies down with Allerton and
starts spooning him. Allerton lets him.
LEE
You do have nice ribs. Show me the
broken one...
Lee starts running his hand down Allerton’s stomach.
71.
72.
LEE (CONT’D)
Is it this one here?
He keeps running his hand down further towards his crotch.
LEE (CONT’D)
Or is it further down?
ALLERTON
(swatting him away.)
Oh, go away.
LEE
But, Gene... I am due, you know.
Allerton looks at him.
ALLERTON
Yes, I suppose you are.
Lee smiles. He starts kissing Allerton’s neck. Allerton
clearly likes it. He breathes in, smelling Lee on him.
LEE
Of course, if you’d rather wait
until tonight... These tropical
nights are so romantic. That way we
could take twelve hours and do the
thing right...
Lee runs his hand all the way down Allerton’s stomach. This
time Allerton lets Lee grab hold of his penis, already hard.
Lee smiles. Allerton shudders slightly.
ALLERTON
Maybe it would be better now... You
know how I like to sleep alone.
LEE
Yes, I know... Too bad.
He starts kissing Allerton’s shoulders.
LEE (CONT’D)
If I had my way, we’d sleep every
night all wrapped around each other
like hibernating rattlesnakes...
Allerton turns around and kisses Lee. They start to take off
each other’s clothes. They kiss passionately, sweetly. Lee
laughs to himself. He speaks to Allerton in baby talk:
72.
73.
LEE (CONT’D)
Wouldn’t it be booful if we should
juth run together into one gweat
big blob?
(off Allerton’s reaction)
Am I giving you the horrors?
ALLERTON
Indeed you are.
Lee smiles. So does Allerton. They keep kissing,
passionately, until, eventually, they begin to make love.
Lee is surprised by the intensity of Allerton’s response.
Instead of his usual coldness and neutrality, Allerton grasps
Lee tightly, squeezing him around the ribs as he comes.
They catch their breath. Allerton sighs, closes his eyes. Lee
smoothes Allerton’s eyebrows with his thumb.
LEE
Do you mind that?
ALLERTON
Not terribly.
Lee keeps smoothing his eyebrows, examining his face.
LEE
But you do enjoy it sometimes? The
whole deal I mean?
ALLERTON
Oh, yes.
Lee stops smoothing his eyebrows. Allerton opens his eyes and
looks at Lee. They hold each other’s gaze for a long beat.
Finally, Lee lies on his back with one cheek on Allerton’s
shoulder. They both close their eyes and drift off to sleep.
INT. BOARDING HOUSE - THE NEXT MORNING
Lee and Allerton eat breakfast, silent. Lee looks over at
Allerton, watching him eat. Allerton doesn’t look up. Lee
scoots his chair closer. Allerton notices but doesn’t react.
Lee puts his hand on Allerton’s leg. Allerton just keeps
eating, sips his coffee. Lee gets out of his chair and gets
on his knees, reaching for Allerton’s belt to unfasten it.
Allerton roughly throws him off.
73.
74.
Lee falls back onto the floor. He looks up at Allerton, hurt.
Allerton looks back at him, completely cold.
Beat. Lee gets up and sits back down across from Allerton.
Allerton goes back to his breakfast. Lee watches him.
LEE
I’m sorry.
Long beat. Allerton doesn’t look up at him.
LEE (CONT’D)
I shouldn’t have tried so soon
after last time... It was a breach
of contract.
ALLERTON
I don’t like people who apologize
at breakfast.
Beat. Lee just keeps watching him eat, scoffs.
LEE
Really, Gene, aren’t you taking
unfair advantage?
Allerton finally looks up at him.
LEE (CONT’D)
Like someone was junk sick and I
don’t use junk, I say: “Sick?
Really, I don’t know why you tell
me about your disgusting condition.
You might at least have the decency
to keep it to yourself. I hate sick
people. You must realize how
distasteful it is to see you
sneezing and yawning and retching.
Why don’t you go someplace where I
don’t have to look at you? You’ve
no idea how tiresome you are, or
how disgusting. Have you no pride?”
ALLERTON
That isn’t fair at all.
LEE
It isn’t supposed to be fair...
Just a routine for your amusement,
containing a modicum of truth.
Allerton goes back to eating. Lee stares at him, hurt.
74.
75.
LEE (CONT’D)
Hurry and finish your breakfast.
You’ll miss the Salinas bus.
ALLERTON
You’re not coming?
LEE
No. I’m going to Quito, remember?
ALLERTON
Oh. Right.
Allerton laughs, dismissively. Lee looks at him, resentful.
INT. AIRPLANE TO QUITO - LATER
Lee sits on the plane, alone.
EXT. QUITO - LATER
Lee walks through the streets. He arrives at the Instituto
Botanico de Quito.
EXT. GARDENS AT THE BOTANICAL INSTITUTE - LATER
Lee walks through the botanical gardens with DOCTOR
HERNANDEZ, 60s, dignified, who is looking at him
suspiciously. They pass a variety of magnificent plants.
DOCTOR HERNANDEZ
Yage?
Lee nods.
DOCTOR HERNANDEZ (CONT’D)
And why did you say you were
interested in this plant, Mr--?
LEE
Lee. I read about it in a magazine.
It said that Yage increases
telepathic sensitivity.
Hernandez smiles.
LEE (CONT’D)
It’s being used by the Russians in
thought control experiments.
Probably by the CIA as well.
75.
76.
DOCTOR HERNANDEZ
Are you with the CIA?
LEE
No.
DOCTOR HERNANDEZ
Then why would you be interested in
thought control experiments?
LEE
I’m not. I’m interested in
telepathy.
DOCTOR HERNANDEZ
Telepathy?
Lee nods. Hernandez looks him over, sighs.
DOCTOR HERNANDEZ (CONT’D)
I suspected that it was only a
matter of time before North
Americans like yourself would start
coming to Ecuador seeking out Yage.
You think it can fix things for
you, open up pathways in your mind.
But what you must understand is
that Yage is a plant with a very
specific history and usage. The
Indians in the jungle have been
using it for thousands of years.
Sometimes they call it Ayahausca.
They cook it as part of a brew for
a tribal ritual. It is not a drug
in the sense you understand it. It
is not recreational like cocaine or
heroin.
LEE
(scoffs)
There’s nothing recreational about
heroin.
DOCTOR HERNANDEZ
My point is that Yage does not
provide a pleasant “trip.” It is
not something to be done casually,
without the proper supervision.
LEE
Could you provide me with that
supervision?
76.
77.
DOCTOR HERNANDEZ
Do I look like an Indian in the
jungle?
Lee looks at him. He doesn’t.
DOCTOR HERNANDEZ (CONT’D)
I’m sorry. I can’t help you.
Doctor Hernandez stops to look at a collection of orchids.
LEE
How much would I have to pay you
for a map?
Beat. Hernandez looks a him, laughs.
DOCTOR HERNANDEZ
I think you misunderstand the
nature of the telepathy that can be
achieved with Yage.
LEE
Communication without speaking? On
the level of intuition?
DOCTOR HERNANDEZ
Who is it that you’re trying so
desperately to communicate with?
Your wife perhaps?
LEE
No.
Dr. Hernandez looks at him. Lee looks back, unflinching. Some
sort of understanding passes between them.
DOCTOR HERNANDEZ
There is an American Botanist
living a few hours outside of Puyo.
Deep in the jungle. Her name is
Cotter. She’s mad like you, trying
to develop some medicine. She says
if she succeeds in concentrating
this medicine, she will make a
fortune. Now I hear she is having a
hard time. Perhaps if you pay her a
visit, she can help you. She has a
relationship with the Indians in
the area. If they trust her,
perhaps she can convince them to
help you.
Lee smiles.
77.
78.
DOCTOR HERNANDEZ (CONT’D)
I warn you, though. Yage is not a
portal to some other place. It is a
mirror. And when you look into it,
you may not like what you see. By
the time you realize you’re not
ready, it may be too late.
Beat. Hernandez sees he hasn’t swayed Lee. He sighs.
DOCTOR HERNANDEZ (CONT’D)
Come. I’ll draw you the map.
Hernandez starts walking towards his office. Lee, excited,
follows.
INT. BUS - A FEW DAYS LATER
Lee and Allerton ride from Ambato to Puyo along the edge of a
gorge a thousand feet deep. Waterfalls, forests, and streams
run down the roadway as they descend into the lush green
valley. Allerton sits in the window seat, looking down.
Suddenly, the bus stops. There’s a boulder on the road ahead.
As the bus driver and some other men get out to move the
boulder, Allerton looks down at abandoned prefabricated
bungalows with the ANNEXIA OIL logo that line the riverbank
in the valley below. Lee looks at Allerton: for a moment, he
seems translucent: Lee can see right through him to the view
outside the bus.
EXT. RIVERBOAT - NEXT DAY
Lee and Allerton sip brandy as they pass springs, moss,
beautiful clear streams, two hundred foot tall trees. The
boat powers upriver, penetrating the jungle stillness with
its lawn-mower whine. Allerton snaps pictures of the jungle
off the bow of the boat. Lee watches.
EXT. THE JUNGLE - THE NEXT DAY
Torrential rain pours as Lee and Allerton traverse a trail
covered with a film of mud. They use canes to steady
themselves, moving slowly, carrying heavy backpacks.
EXT. A HUT - LATER
The rain has died down a bit. Lee speaks with a VILLAGER
outside of her hut.
78.
79.
LEE
Cotter. El Doctor. American.
VILLAGER
(pointing)
En esa dirección.
LEE
Cuanto tiempo?
VILLAGER
(shrugs)
Dos o tres horas.
EXT. JUNGLE - LATER
Allerton and Lee keep walking. They pass what look like they
might be ancient ruins, long horizontal stone structures
embedded in the ground. They keep moving, using machetes to
cut through the thick brush. A SNAKE slithers by on the
ground in front of them. They stop, standing still, letting
it go by.
All around them are vines with feather-shaped leaves.
EXT. A SMALL THATCHED HUT - NIGHT
Lee and Allerton finally come upon a lone hut with a lamp
burning -- the only source of light besides the moon. They
look at each other: Lee goes up and knocks on the door.
Beat. They hear some rustling inside, some whispers.
Lee knocks again. More rustling.
Faintly, they both hear a hissing sound. Allerton and Lee
look at each other, confused. The hissing gets louder. We see
it first before Lee: two small GREEN EYES are peering at him,
coiled around a post near the door to the hut, right next to
his head. He turns and sees a FIVE FOOT VIPER.
Just as he screams and jumps back, the snake lunges into
frame, knocking them off the doorstep and back to the grass.
Lee tackles Allerton to the ground, preventing the snake from
biting him. They shuffle along the ground as the snake
slithers after them. Meanwhile, the door to the hut opens,
and a WOMAN IN SILHOUETTE stands, watching, holding a stick.
LEE
HELP!
79.
80.
The woman doesn’t move. The snake catches up to Lee and
Allerton, raising its body like it’s going to strike again.
LEE (CONT’D)
For the love of God, help us!
The woman walks over and smacks the snake nonchalantly with
the stick. The snake turns around starts going for the woman,
but she holds the stick like a pool cue and pokes the snake
right in the eye. The snake hisses angrily, then slithers off
into the jungle. Lee and Allerton watch, in shock. They look
up at the woman, still in silhouette, holding the stick
threateningly.
WOMAN
(with a slight lisp)
Announce yourselves or prepare to
suffer a fate worse than whatever
that viper was gonna give you.
Lee starts to get up to approach the woman. Woman takes out a
pistol from her back pocket and points it at Lee.
WOMAN (CONT’D)
Right there is fine.
LEE
(hands out in front)
My name is William Lee. This is
Eugene Allerton. We’ve come a long
way to talk with you.
He stands, hands still up, and sees the woman in the light
now: mid 50s, small, wiry, somewhat disturbed-looking,
standing there pointing the gun. Behind her, leaning against
the doorway, there is a YOUNGER ECUADORIAN MAN, looking at
all of them. Lee smiles.
LEE (CONT’D)
Doctor Cotter, I presume?
Cotter doesn’t say anything.
LEE (CONT’D)
I hear you might be in need of some
supplies.
Lee starts to reach for his sack. Cotter cocks the gun.
Lee very slowly rummages through the sack, keeping eye
contact with Cotter. He pulls out a bottle of puro and
extends it to Cotter. Cotter examines it, looks over at the
man in the doorway, then pops open the top, sniffs it. She
takes a drink.
80.
81.
She gestures with the bottle over to the Man in the doorway.
He comes over, sniffs it, and takes a drink too.
COTTER
(gun still pointed at
them.)
How can I help you?
Lee and Allerton aren’t sure what to say. The Ecuadorian man,
her HUSBAND, puts his hand on Cotter’s shoulder.
COTTER’S HUSBAND
Comamos.
He turns around and heads inside. Beat. Cotter gestures for
Lee and Allerton to follow him. They do.
INT. COTTER’S HUT - LATER
Lee and Allerton sit at the table with Cotter and HER
HUSBAND, a skinny Ecuadorian man. He also has no teeth.
They eat a meal composed of the supplies Lee and Allerton
brought -- some sardines, liver paté -- and the food Cotter
and her husband have in the hut -- some sort of fibrous root
and bananas from the jungle. They drink the puro cut with
some tea. They are all a bit drunk.
Sitting next to Cotter at the table there’s a TINY MONKEY, to
whom Cotter occasionally feeds food. ANOTHER MONKEY roams
about the kitchen, feeding itself from Lee’s supplies.
Though the hut itself is rough-hewn and primitive, Cotter and
her husband have arranged the spartan inside -- full of
books, artifacts, lab equipment -- to approximate some kind
of academic domesticity. It is not the chaotic jungle shack
of a mad scientist: if you squint, it could almost be the
modest university apartment of a worldly professor, which
just makes it all the more unsettling that it sits in this
jungle occupied by these odd, haggard people.
On the floor lies a TWO-TOED SLOTH, thrashing about and
hissing. Allerton eyes it curiously.
COTTER
My apologies about the viper. He’s
there for security, of course.
LEE
Security?
81.
82.
COTTER
From prowlers. Coming after my
research. I assume they told you
about it in Quito?
LEE
Yes. Of course. Or, well, they
didn’t give me all the details.
Beat. Cotter looks at them suspiciously.
COTTER
Why did you say you boys came out
here?
LEE
We wanted to ask you... about the
vegetation in the area.
COTTER
The vegetation?
Lee nods. Cotter laughs.
COTTER (CONT’D)
I suppose I would be the right
person to ask about that.
Cotter’s husband laughs too. Cotter drinks a shot of puro,
winces.
ALLERTON
Why would people be coming after
your research?
COTTER
I’m developing a local anesthetic.
To be used in medical procedures.
If I’m successful, it will change
the face of modern medicine. You’ve
seen one of these before?
Cotter reaches over for a BLOW DART QUIVER, takes out a dart
and extends it towards Allerton for him to see. Allerton
reaches for it.
COTTER (CONT’D)
Don’t touch it. If you accidentally
prick yourself, you’ll be dead in a
matter of seconds.
Allerton retracts his hand, not sure if she’s serious.
82.
83.
COTTER (CONT’D)
The Indians out here dip their
darts in a substance called curare.
She indicates a receptacle with an odd looking substance
inside on the top of the quiver.
COTTER (CONT’D)
Been doing it for generations. It’s
a poison that inhibits the
nicotinic acetylcholine receptor,
causing weakness of the skeletal
muscles and eventual death by
asphyxiation due to paralysis of
the diaphragm. Incredibly
effective. But if you can separate
the substance’s toxic properties
from the properties that make it a
muscle relaxant, you’re left with a
product that’s cheaper and more
effective than anything currently
on the market for surgeries, dental
procedures, any number of things.
(smiles)
It’s how hubby and I plan to become
millionaires.
Cotter’s husband smiles his toothless smile, offers Allerton
some more banana slop - he refuses. Cotter pours another
shot.
COTTER (CONT’D)
I’m not the first gringo to have
the idea, but I am the only one
who’s gained the trust of the
Indians. And that trust makes all
the difference.
Lee’s eye wanders over the indigenous artifacts that are
scattered about the room: beads, a headdress, a blowgun, a
shrunken head, a statue of the spirit Tsunki. On a counter,
he sees a ceremonial bowl. Cotter notices Lee staring.
COTTER (CONT’D)
Those are all gifts from the Shuar
people. My tribe, so to speak. Have
you ever seen a real shrunken head?
Cotter gets up to show Lee.
LEE
Can I ask about the bowl?
83.
84.
COTTER
(stops)
The bowl?
Lee points to it. Cotter frowns slightly, looks at him.
COTTER (CONT’D)
It’s for a healing ceremony...
involving a brew that’s made from
one of the plants in the area.
LEE
Yage?
Beat. Cotter and her husband look at Lee. So does Allerton.
LEE (CONT’D)
Maybe out here it’s called
Ayahuasca? I’ve heard that the
Russians and the Americans are
using it for different experiments.
The truth is that’s why we came out
here.
Cotter doesn’t say anything.
LEE (CONT’D)
I think there might be a buck in it
if someone could bring it back to
the West. I want to investigate the
properties of this drug.
(trying to sound casual)
I’d be willing to take some... as
an experiment. We both would.
Allerton looks at Lee. Cotter looks back and forth between
them. Tense, long silence.
COTTER
Yage is connected to brujeria.
Witchcraft. To get some, you’d have
to develop a relationship with the
local brujo. It would take you
years to gain his confidence.
LEE
Do you have that confidence?
COTTER
(coldly)
I’ve been out here for a long time.
Lee just stares at her. Long, uncomfortable beat.
84.
85.
COTTER’S HUSBAND
(breaking the silence.)
The boys must be tired, no?
COTTER
Yes. I imagine they are.
Cotter smiles, gets up and starts clearing the table.
COTTER (CONT’D)
I thank you again for the supplies.
Let me show you where you’ll sleep.
INT. BACK OF THE HUT
Cotter, holding an oil lamp, leads Allerton and Lee up a
creaky wooden ladder.
INT. ATTIC OF THE HUT
Cotter shines the lamp on a cot about thirty inches wide made
of bamboo slats. Lee and Allerton look at it.
COTTER
I guess you can both make out here.
Lee and Allerton put their things down. Lee lies down on the
cot near the wall. Allerton lies down near the outside.
Cotter puts down the lamp to set up a net.
LEE
Mosquitoes?
COTTER
No. Vampire bats.
She zips it up.
COTTER (CONT’D)
Goodnight.
Cotter leaves. Lee and Allerton listen to her go down the
ladder. When she gets to her husband they say something
inaudible to each other. They both giggle. She turns out the
lamp, then turns out the other lamp downstairs, plunging them
into darkness. Allerton and Lee are illuminated only by the
moonlight that pours in through a hole in the roof. Lee turns
to Allerton, hushed.
LEE
She has it, don’t you think?
85.
86.
Allerton shrugs.
LEE (CONT’D)
We’re close.
Allerton gives just the faintest smile, then turns on his
side and closes his eyes. Lee’s eyes stay open, staring up at
the stars, excited.
DARKNESS
The sound of heavy footsteps on creaky wood...
INT. ATTIC OF THE HUT - MORNING
Lee opens his eyes and sees Cotter, standing above him in
front of the hole in the roof, backlit by the sun, holding a
.22 rifle.
He looks at her, then looks for Allerton, who’s not there.
COTTER
Your friend’s already up having
coffee with hubby.
She throws the rifle to Lee. Lee, startled, catches it.
COTTER (CONT’D)
Why don’t you take this and explore
the area today. Try and kill us
something we can eat tonight.
Cotter leaves. Lee looks at the rifle.
EXT. THE JUNGLE - LATER
Lee and Allerton walk surrounded again by vines with feather-
shaped green leaves. The jungle seems devoid of animal life.
ALLERTON
Cotter says the Indians have
cleaned most of the game out of the
area. They all have shotguns from
the money they made working for
Annexia.
LEE
(hears something)
Was that squawking?
Allerton looks at him, unsure. Lee heads in that direction.
86.
87.
LEE (CONT’D)
I’m going to try to shoot it.
ALLERTON
What is it?
LEE
How should I know? It’s alive,
isn’t it?
Lee pushes through the undergrowth beside the trail. He trips
on a vine and falls into a saw-toothed plant. When he tries
to get up, a hundred sharp points catch his clothes and stick
into his flesh. He screams out in pain.
LEE (CONT’D)
Gene! Help me!
Allerton rushes over and cuts him free with the machete.
INT. COTTER’S HUT - LATER
Lee’s leg is up on a chair as Cotter painfully removes
needles from his skin. He winces every time Cotter pulls one
out, looking over at Allerton, who sits with Cotter’s husband
at the other end of the hut, playing with one of the monkeys.
Cotter eyes them both.
COTTER
Tell the truth now. Are you boys
really just here for Yage?
Lee just looks at her.
COTTER (CONT’D)
I appreciate the supplies you
brought, but if I welcome you into
my home and I find you trying to
run off with my research, I’ll kill
you and dump you in the jungle. No
one will miss you out here.
LEE
(laughs)
Doc, With all due respect, I
couldn’t give two shits about your
research. I already forgot
everything you told me about it.
Cotter looks him over for a long beat. She roughly pulls a
needle from Lee’s leg. Lee yelps in pain.
87.
88.
COTTER
You know it doesn’t get you high,
right? Not like you’re used to.
(off Lee’s look.)
I’m a medical doctor. I can spot a
junky from a mile away.
LEE
I’m not interested in getting high.
COTTER
Then what are you interested in?
LEE
Telepathy.
Beat. Cotter looks over at Allerton. Lee looks over too.
Cotter sees the way Lee looks at him.
COTTER
There’s this Shuar Myth, The Fox
and the Jaguar. You ever hear of
it?
Lee looks at her, shakes his head.
COTTER (CONT’D)
Real old story. You boys reminded
me of it. There’s this fox, right?
And he deceives a jaguar into
making love the way two males of a
species make love. When the jaguar
looks behind him and realizes
what’s happening, he gets this big
smile on his face and he chases the
fox all around the jungle and bites
him. Doesn’t kill him or anything --
just kind of gives him a nibble.
Lee looks at her, unsure what to make of it.
COTTER (CONT’D)
You see, the Indians out here have
no real conception of the sort of
thing that’s going on between the
two of you. The Spanish tried to
convince them a couple centuries
ago that it was evil and all that
nonsense, but the idea never really
caught on. For them, it’s more
about being a trickster. Like
children playing a game.
88.
89.
Lee doesn’t say anything. Cotter looks over at Allerton, then
back at Lee.
COTTER (CONT’D)
So which one of you is the fox and
which one is the jaguar?
Beat. Lee smiles. So does Cotter.
COTTER (CONT’D)
I’ll help you.
Lee looks at her. Cotter picks up a green feather-shaped leaf
from a table nearby -- the same kind that’s on all the vines
in the jungle: Lee instantly recognizes it as the leaf he
tripped over in the jungle earlier.
COTTER (CONT’D)
Banisteriopsis caapi. The Indians
call it Yage.
Lee looks at the leaf, transfixed.
EXT. COTTER’S HUT - THE NEXT DAY, DUSK
As the sun is setting, Lee and Allerton walk up to the hut
from the jungle. Lee limps a little from his injury the day
before. He leans on Allerton up the hill. As they approach,
they can see that there’s a fire burning outside -- a strong,
strange smell wafts through the air. Lee and Allerton sniff
it. Faintly, they hear chanting. They stop and look at each
other.
Allerton sees that Lee is suddenly nervous, apprehensive.
Allerton laughs, shakes his head, and keeps heading towards
the hut. Lee follows.
EXT. COTTER’S HUT - LATER
The “bowl” Lee noticed earlier sits on a bed of sticks above
a small fire made of forest logs. Inside burns a mixture of
what look like twigs, roots, and the leaves from the vines we
saw in the jungle.
Cotter, who now wears an enormous wicker mask with holes only
for the eyes, waves around a branch of the vine, chanting in
the Shuar language.
Lee and Allerton sit on the ground with Cotter’s husband, who
also wears a mask.
89.
90.
Cotter keeps chanting, mixing the brew, which is now bubbling
brownish/grey, until, finally, she stops. She lifts the mask
to smell the brew, looks up at everyone.
Lee and Allerton watch as Cotter starts to grab four cups --
two little ones, two big, and fills them up with the brew.
She looks at them, gestures for them to come forward.
Allerton and Lee look at each other. They both get up and
approach Cotter. She hands them each a cup. She hands one to
her husband. They all stand there holding them.
COTTER
(chanting in Shuar)
I, I, I, I, I, I, I / I am like
Tsunki / When I take Yage / My body
becomes cold / I, I, I, I, I / I am
sitting with Tsunki
Cotter looks at the group. She downs her cup under her mask.
So does her husband. Allerton and Lee look at each other.
They down theirs.
EXT. AWAY FROM COTTER’S HUT - HALF AN HOUR LATER
Lee and Allerton sit on the grass a bit away from the hut,
watching the sun set over the trees. Behind them in the
distance, we can see Cotter and her husband sitting by the
fire, still wearing their masks. It’s quiet, peaceful. Lee
turns to Allerton.
LEE
You feel anything?
ALLERTON
No. You?
Lee shakes his head. Allerton looks over towards the fire.
ALLERTON (CONT’D)
I think we just drank a bunch of
leaves and twigs from the ground...
LEE
Yeah... You might be right.
Lee looks down, disappointed. Allerton looks at him,
sympathetic. Lee sighs, looks over at the fire.
LEE (CONT’D)
You think the doc and her husband
are trying to go to bed with us?
90.
91.
ALLERTON
(laughs)
What? All together?
Lee nods.
ALLERTON (CONT’D)
I don’t think the doc would go for
it.
LEE
No?
Allerton shakes his head.
LEE (CONT’D)
Yeah... I guess you’re right.
(looks towards the hut,
raises an eyebrow)
The husband though... That’s one
horny bitch if I ever saw one.
They both laugh, hard. Lee sighs.
LEE (CONT’D)
Let’s get out of here, shall we?
ALLERTON
Yeah. Let’s.
Lee gets up and stretches his arms. He yawns, big, when,
suddenly, something strange happens:
A fleshy balloon starts to form from his mouth.
A look of total terror flashes across Lee’s eyes as the
balloon gets bigger and bigger. Allerton sees it too, eyes
full of the same terror, until he realizes that he too is
forming a fleshy balloon from his mouth. They look at each
other, scared, amazed as the balloons stretch and stretch
until... Lee’s pops.
A spray of vomit falls onto the forest ground in between him
and Allerton, and in the center of the puddle, Lee’s heart,
detached from his body, is beating on the ground.
Allerton’s balloon bursts too, and his beating heart flops
onto the ground next to Lee’s.
They look at each other, eyes wide like animals as their
hearts lie beating in the vomit puddles between them. The
trip has begun.
91.
92.
EXT. THE HUT - MOMENTS LATER
Lee and Allerton stumble back to where Cotter and her husband
are sitting peacefully Indian style on the ground in front of
the fire. Around them, the jungle has descended into night --
the fire that cooked the brew is the only light illuminating
them, and it’s now burned down significantly. Cotter sees the
looks in their eyes, nods to her husband. He gets up and
helps them both onto the ground.
Lee and Allerton look at the fire. We see Lee’s POV: every
flicker of flame makes a SOUND -- like a chord being played
on the piano. Lee listens to it, transfixed. He looks over at
Allerton: Allerton also listens to the fire.
As Lee keeps looking at him, he can see that Allerton’s body
is becoming translucent.
Lee’s eyes trace Allerton’s neck, ears, shoulders, landing on
his thin hands, now almost completely see-through. Lee looks
down at his own hands: he too is becoming translucent.
He looks up and sees that Allerton is looking at him. Their
eyes lock: a pathway is opened between them, completely
overwhelming. Allerton speaks but his lips do not move.
ALLERTON’S MIND
I’m not queer.
The words hit Lee. He just looks at Allerton. The fire
flickers through them both, still making sounds like music.
ALLERTON’S MIND (CONT’D)
Lee. I’m not queer.
LEE’S MIND
I know.
ALLERTON’S MIND
I’m disembodied.
They just look at each other, open, both becoming phantoms as
the fire keeps flickering through them, burning down to its
last embers.
EXT. THE HUT - A FEW HOURS LATER
The fire now completely extinguished, it is dark outside, the
only light coming from the stars. Faintly illuminated by the
moonlight, we see Cotter and her husband still sitting there,
looking at something. Cotter rests her head on her husband’s
shoulder, sweetly. We hear strange, animal sounds.
92.
93.
In the space where the moonlight hits the dirt, Lee and
Allerton are rolling around naked: somewhere between
wrestling and making love. It’s intensely erotic: violent,
but tender -- less like two animals mating and more like two
bodies thrashing against each other. Lee and Allerton start
to disappear into each other, until, eventually, they inhabit
one body, thrashing in the moonlight.
Cotter, watching, lifts her mask as if to see better. We can
see by her face that she is rapt. So is her husband.
DARKNESS
A burst of flame from a match being lit. Cotter uses the
match to light a lamp, illuminating Lee and Allerton, who are
each lying languid, naked in different corners of the small
hut. They look at the light, then at each other. The trip is
over.
Weakly, they start to sit up. Cotter brings them their
clothes.
INT. BACK OF THE HUT - A FEW MINUTES LATER
Lee and Allerton climb silently, a little wobbly, up the
wooden ladder.
INT. ATTIC OF THE HUT - LATER
They lie staring up at the ceiling. Long, long silence. Lee
turns to Allerton.
LEE
Gene --
Allerton says nothing. Lee reaches over to touch his shoulder
-- Allerton turns his body away from Lee and closes his eyes.
ALLERTON
Go to sleep.
Lee just lies there, shocked, frozen, tears starting to form
in his eyes. We pan to Allerton, whose eyes are closed: he
too has tears forming, about to fall.
EXT. THE HUT - THE NEXT MORNING
Allerton drinks a cup of coffee and eats a banana on the
porch with Cotter, who feeds the monkey on his shoulder.
93.
94.
COTTER
You boys should stay a couple more
days. For most people, the first
time’s just an introduction: the
opening of a door. But for you two
it was... something else. It’d be a
shame not to see where it might
take you.
Allerton shakes his head, not looking up at her.
ALLERTON
I need to be getting back.
Cotter looks him over, shrugs.
In the background, Lee emerges from the hut, carrying some of
their things and putting them out on the ground, getting them
ready to leave.
He nods at Cotter. Cotter nods back.
Allerton doesn’t turn to look at Lee. Cotter notices. She
leans in and whispers:
COTTER
What are you so afraid of?
Allerton looks up at her, eyes piercing. She laughs.
COTTER (CONT’D)
Door’s already open. Can’t close it
now. All you can do is look away.
But why would you?
Allerton keeps looking at her. Cotter smiles her toothless
smile.
COTTER (CONT’D)
You should’ve seen yourself last
night.
Allerton just looks at her, disturbed, as she keeps smiling.
EXT. THE JUNGLE - LATER
Lee and Allerton walk.
Lee looks at Allerton. Allerton doesn’t look back. Lee
focuses on Allerton’s thin hands: for a moment, they appear
see-through. Allerton turns to look at Lee: his body snaps
back to complete solidity. Lee looks away. They keep walking,
descending back towards the city.
94.
95.
Suddenly, Lee looks up as if he’s heard a sound coming from
the sky. We pan up, and immediately the sky turns to night,
full of stars.
Hold. Sounds of wildlife, insects, breeze.
Almost imperceptibly, a tiny dot begins to fall from the sky.
It gets bigger and bigger until we see that it is Lee,
falling slowly.
He descends until he lands on his feet in...
EXT. PANAMA CITY - DAY
SUPER: TWO YEARS LATER.
Lee walks, alone, now in Panama, Allerton’s camera slung
around his neck, passing all the places they passed together.
The city is sweltering. Wet heat and smog. Lee passes pimps,
prostitutes, beggars, merchants. He makes eye contact with
everyone he sees: it’s overwhelming, intense, as if he’s
telepathically communicating with all of them at once.
EXT. THE STREET - EVENING
Lee walks down the main drag. A PIMP seizes his arm.
PIMP
I got a fourteen year old girl,
Jack. Puerto Rican. How’s about it?
Lee just looks at the guy, completely cold. The look stops
the pimp in his tracks. Pimp lets go of his arm. Lee keeps
walking.
INT. AIRPLANE TO MEXICO CITY - NEXT DAY
Lee sits in an aisle seat. He looks past the TOURIST next to
him, trying to get a glimpse of the city which is just coming
into view. Lee looks down at the guy’s hands. They look oddly
similar to Allerton’s. Guy looks at him. Lee looks away.
EXT. SHIP AHOY - EVENING
Lee walks up to the bar, looks at it.
LEE
Easy now. Cool. Cool.
95.
96.
He heads inside.
INT. SHIP AHOY - CONTINUOUS
The place has been redecorated - it’s almost empty. Lee looks
at a spot where there’s a bullet hole still lodged in the
wall from when he shot the mouse. He looks over at the table
where Allerton used to play chess with Mary, now replaced by
a pool table. At the bar, a large man in his 40s sits
drinking a beer. Lee approaches. The guy turns around and
sees him: It’s Joe Guidry. Joe smiles.
LATER
Lee and Joe are a few drinks in.
LEE
What about Johnny White? Russ
Morton? Pete Crowley? Ike Scranton?
JOE GUIDRY
Los Angeles, Alaska, Idaho... Most
everybody is gone since you went
away. Or, at least, nobody hangs
around here anymore. Not since Tom
sold the place.
Beat. Joe takes a sip of his drink, looks at Lee.
JOE GUIDRY (CONT’D)
Anybody else you’d like to ask me
about?
Lee just looks at him.
JOE GUIDRY (CONT’D)
No one?
Lee still says nothing.
JOE GUIDRY (CONT’D)
A kid named Allerton? Maybe?
Lee looks at him.
JOE GUIDRY (CONT’D)
It’s why you came back, isn’t it?
LEE
I was getting around to it.
96.
97.
JOE GUIDRY
He went down to South America or
some place. With an army colonel.
LEE
How long ago?
JOE GUIDRY
About six months. Allerton went
along as guide. They were going to
sell the car in Guatemala. A ‘48
Cadillac. I felt there was
something not quite right about the
deal, but Allerton never told me
anything definite. You know how he
is. Nobody’s heard from him since
he left. He said something about
joining you down there.
Lee looks at him, taken aback -- this is the first he’s
hearing of it.
JOE GUIDRY (CONT’D)
He never said anything to you about
it?
Lee shakes his head. Guidry shrugs, looks him over. He
notices Allerton’s camera.
JOE GUIDRY (CONT’D)
When did you get this?
Lee doesn’t say anything. Guidry laughs.
JOE GUIDRY (CONT’D)
You know what happened to my
camera?
LEE
Stolen -- JOE GUIDRY (CONT’D)
Stolen by this Colombian kid
I was getting acquainted
with. Took a bunch of my
socks too. Little shit...
Guidry sighs, wistful. Lee just looks down at the table.
JOE GUIDRY (CONT’D)
So what’s the story? You making it
with anyone these days?
Lee just looks at him, shakes his head. Guidry laughs.
97.
98.
JOE GUIDRY (CONT’D)
Well, the Chimu’s still here. Why
don’t we go check out the local
nightlife?
Beat. Lee shakes his head. Guidry sighs.
JOE GUIDRY (CONT’D)
Yeah, I’m not really feeling up for
it either...
(smiles, joking.)
Green Lantern?
LEE
Those guys are still here?
JOE GUIDRY
All of them, if you can believe it.
(beat.)
Well, except for Dumé. He’s gone.
LEE
He died?
JOE GUIDRY
No, no. He just had to go back to
Virginia to take care of his
mother.
LEE
Oh... Funny to think about him
having a mother.
JOE GUIDRY
Well he doesn’t anymore. She died.
LEE
Right.
They both knock their drinks back. Long beat. Finally, Guidry
looks at him.
JOE GUIDRY
You look good, Lee.
LEE
(surprised.)
I do?
JOE GUIDRY
(considers.)
No. But it’s good to see you.
98.
99.
LEE
Yeah. You too.
They look at each other for a moment. Guidry pats him on the
shoulder, then signals to the bartender for another round.
EXT. AMSTERDAM AVENUE PARK - LATER, SUNSET
Lee walks, drunk, camera round his neck. There is a slight
breeze -- the blue flowers blow around the ground.
INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
In the same room where Lee took the young Mexican man, he
lies in the darkness, sleeping. The window is slightly open,
curtains billow in the breeze. Outside, we hear the nocturnal
sounds of Mexico City: a shooting, a fight, some catcalling.
Behind Lee’s closed eyelids, the eyes flutter with activity.
He’s clearly having an intense dream.
Sound from the Mexico City streets outside starts to mingle
curiously with distinct sounds from New York, New Orleans,
St. Louis -- taxis honking in Times Square, a Mardi Gras
parade, a Cardinals game -- until suddenly, all sound from
the outside stops. So does the breeze.
Lee’s eyes open. He looks around, confused by the silence and
the stillness, until he notices something that makes him sit
up, confused, curious.
On the little desk in the hotel room there appears to be a
miniature city, like a diorama that takes up the entire
table. Lee scrunches his face, gets up and approaches it in
the silence. He looks at it curiously. The miniature city is
an amalgamation of different cities: Mexico City, New York,
New Orleans, St. Louis. His eye settles on a street. He leans
in closer, looking at it. He starts to hum “Johnny’s So Long
at the Fair.” Sounds of the street start to creep in, getting
louder and louder until, suddenly, we’re there.
INT./EXT. HOTEL ROOM/CITY STREETS - SAME TIME
Lee watches as a miniature version of himself is now walking
through the nowhere/everywhere city. We cut back and forth
between BIG LEE looking down at the miniature from the hotel
room and LITTLE LEE on the ground as he passes: the capsized
SS Normandie in New York’s pier 88, an old-fashioned Milk Bar
in Times Square, and finally, a row of Penny Arcade peep
holes in what looks like a construction wall along a street.
99.
100.
Lee approaches an empty spot with a viewing hole and looks
through it. His eyes go wide. We see what he sees:
Allerton, floating in a void, his back to Lee. Lee watches,
spellbound, as Allerton slowly turns around. Rays of light
protrude from Allerton’s eye sockets. He looks directly at
Lee -- the light from Allerton’s eyes blinds him.
Suddenly Lee is back on the street. He walks past a strange
amalgamation of buildings from different cities until he
looks up at one high rise -- a hotel. One window is open, a
curtain flapping in the wind.
In the Mexican hotel room, Big Lee leans in to look through
the open window.
INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - SAME TIME
Big Lee’s enormous eye peers in through the window as Little
Lee walks slowly down the hallway. Faintly, Little Lee hears
hissing coming from one of the rooms. He heads over towards
it, confused. The door to the room is cracked slightly open.
INT. THE HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Lee opens the door to find a snake eating its own tail on the
red tile floor. The snake is crying as it eats itself. Tears
run down its skin. Lee looks at it curiously, then looks up
at the bed.
Allerton is lying there, half his body under a pane of glass.
The wind shifts in the room and suddenly Allerton is sitting
up, looking at Lee, only his torso visible: his bottom half
has curiously disappeared. Something passes between them.
They look at each other the way they looked at each other in
the hut in the jungle. They are telepathically communicating,
but this time we don’t hear what they say.
Allerton stands up, reaches for a tequila glass sitting on
the counter, and places it on top of his head. He looks at
Lee. Lee looks back at him. They understand each other
completely.
Slowly, Lee draws a pistol from his pocket and aims it at the
glass. He stands there, arm extended, finger on the trigger.
Allerton stands, balancing the glass, completely still. Long
beat as they just stare into each other’s eyes.
BANG.
100.
101.
Little Lee pulls the trigger. The bullet hits Allerton right
in the center of the forehead: he drops to the ground with a
thud, instantly lifeless.
Lee lets out an involuntary groan. The tequila glass drops
from Allerton’s head and rolls across the floor towards
Little Lee.
Lee looks at Allerton, shocked, numb, his arm still extended,
pointing the gun, smoke still sputtering from the barrel.
He looks down at the shot glass, face full of anguish. It
rolls, getting closer and closer but never arriving at his
feet -- an endless, asymptotic approach.
He puts the still smoking gun back in his pants and
approaches Allerton, on the ground, kneeling down almost as
if to revive him. He looks at the hole in Allerton’s head, a
small trickle of blood still pouring out. He kisses
Allerton’s lifeless lips, sweetly, passionately, eyes closed.
When he opens them, Allerton is gone, disappeared from the
floor.
Around the room, all traces of him have disappeared as well.
The room looks untouched: the bed is made, the closets empty.
Lee stands up, dazed, looking around. He turns and faces the
door. Beat.
He goes to open it and catches sight of his hand on the
doorknob: it is becoming translucent. He looks at it
curiously -- his entire arm is becoming see-through. He turns
the knob and opens the door. Wind blows through the room.
He goes to exit --
ALLERTON’S MIND
Lee.
He turns around, quickly, breathlessly, but no one is there.
Not even Lee himself. His body too has disappeared
completely.
Wind keeps blowing through the empty room until, suddenly,
the door swings shut. The curtains settle back, one curtain
trailing inside the window as if someone had taken it off and
tossed it there.
INT. HOTEL ROOM IN MEXICO CITY - SAME TIME
Big Lee backs away from the miniature -- and we see now that
he has aged dramatically: he is a thin, very old man, looking
uncannily like Burroughs at 83, the age of his death.
101.
102.
He shakes a bit, perhaps from junk sickness, perhaps just
from old age.
Outside, through the window, we see that the sun is just
starting to rise over Mexico City.
Lee, as the old man, goes and shakily sits down on the bed.
He looks over at the desk: the miniature is gone. He sits
there, alone, thinking. He lies down on the bed and closes
his eyes. Long beat in the silence, stillness, tight on Lee
lying there with his eyes closed.
From out of frame, we hear a body next to Lee turning over.
A leg -- Allerton’s -- flops over onto Lee’s body.
Old man Lee feels it but doesn’t open his eyes -- doesn’t
dare move a muscle. He just lies there, completely still,
trying not to shake so as not to wake Allerton and have him
move away.
END.
102.
