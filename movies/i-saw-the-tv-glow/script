      Various pastel hues of PINK and PURPLE blink rapidly across
the screen as WE HEAR...
TUMBLING, GASPING, and FALLING. Like a body rolled down a
steep cliff against its will. And accompanied by:
GYM CLASS KIDS
(counting in unison)
6! 5! 4! 3! 2! 1!
1 INT. GYMNASIUM - DAY 1
This GYM CLASS of elementary school kids all move together in
a big circle, each holding onto their share of a big plastic
PARACHUTE, colored vibrantly with those same pastel shades of
pink and purple.
In unison, they WHIP the parachute high up into the air,
creating a massive and temporary DOME in the center of the
gymnasium.
And at that exact moment of creation, they all DUCK
underneath the parachute, sneaking inside its innards.
We duck inside too, following just behind them, the parachute
now towering over us like a giant pink pillow fort.
We follow one YOUNG BOY, 10, lost and dazed, his face blank.
He wanders through the bubblegum-tinted chaos like an amnesia
victim.
All around him his classmates SCREAM and DANCE and PLAY. All
the while the paper-thin roof of the parachute slowly
deflates downwards, a celebration in the process of self￾immolation.
We keep following close to this one confused boy. His name is
OWEN.
There's something dawning in Owen's eyes. Something akin to
fear. Like he's just realized that he's alive, and that's a
kind of horrifying realization.
The parachute descends over Young Owen, muffling the cheers
and hysterics of his classmates.
2 EXT. SNOWY BACKYARDS - DAY 2
Now Owen plays alone in the fresh aftermath of a winter
blizzard, stumbling across conjoining backyards. He's a
little puff ball in his bulky snow gear.

He crawls inside a small HOMEMADE CAVE that someone has
packed together out of snow in one backyard.
He stares up at the wintry cavern just above him, alone, lost
in dreams.
3 INT. OWEN'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 3
Owen now sits on the couch in his living room flipping
channels on a television from the 1990s. The kind of bulky
CRT model now rendered extinct by flat screens.
There's not much on television tonight for him to watch.
News. Sports. Informercials. He keeps flipping.
We can't see the screen itself. But we can hear the sounds of
each new channel as he flips past. And we can see the
flickering glow that the screen casts against the couch and
against his face.
Eventually, Owen lands on a channel that somehow seems louder
than all of the others --
TV ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
(serious voice)
Next week on The "Pink Opaque..."
Owen watches an unseen commercial for what sounds like a
children's horror TV show. Pink and red light flickers across
his face as he slowly sits up on the couch.
From the screen -- we can hear ISABEL and TARA, two teenagers
arguing in panic.
ISABEL (V.O.)
(from the screen)
"Drain lords!" Hundreds of them,
Tara... coming out of the drains!
TARA (V.O.)
(from the screen)
It's Mr. Melancholy! It's just a
trick.
Owen stares mystified at the screen. He's finally found
something worthy of his attention.
ISABEL (V.O.)
(from the screen)
How am I ever going to shower
again?!

TARA (V.O.)
(from the screen)
--They can't hurt you if you don't
think about them. They can't hurt
you if you don't think about them!
TV ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
Saturday at 10:30pm, only on--
OWEN'S MOM (O.S.)
(calling from upstairs)
It's past bedtime, Owen!
Owen fumbles for the remote. He very quickly CHANGES THE
CHANNEL back to the nightly news.
He looks guilty, like he was just caught in the act of
something forbidden.
He takes a moment before responding.
YOUNG OWEN
Sorry! Coming!
Owen hops up from the couch and heads up the staircase.
But we remain downstairs, in this room that's now empty save
the glow of the screen.
ADULT OWEN (V.O.)
It was raining last night, and I
couldn't sleep. So I started my
favorite TV show again. 'The Pink
Opaque...'
4 EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - EARLY EVENING 4
It's summertime now, and all is calm on this quiet suburban
street.
It's not yet dusk, but it's late enough that the streetlights
have turned on. There are lights on in some of the houses
too, but no one is out on the street anymore.
As the CREDITS begin, we drift slowly, traveling like a ghost
over:
A child's CHALK SCRIBBLINGS on the pavement, an epic pink and
purple neon collage, all overlapped and blended lines
interweaving manically with little half-realized monsters
scribbled into the folds. It looks like something a 5-year
old Jackson Pollack would draw.

ADULT OWEN (V.O.)
It'd been a few years since I'd
watched it all the way through...
Out in the distance, way down the street, spinning in a
rickety, endless circle--
The top of a lone ICE CREAM TRUCK, parked across the road as
if to block traffic. A smiling, animatronic SOFT-SERVE HEAD
creaks and rotates in a circle, accompanied by an endless
loop of anemic music box melody.
ADULT OWEN (V.O.)
And I told myself I'd watch it in
order this time. From the
beginning.
5 INT. ISABEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 5
ISABEL, 16, glares defiantly into her reflection in her
bedroom mirror as she finishes applying black mascara.
She's wearing a PROM DRESS, but her expression looks like
she's getting ready for war, not a high school dance.
Out her open bedroom window, we can hear the faint repetition
of the Ice Cream Truck's song.
Isabel caps her mascara pen and glares once more at her
reflection.
Then, without even a flicker hesitation, she GRABS A BATTLE
AXE OFF THE NIGHT STAND and JUMPS OUT THE WINDOW.
6 EXT. ANOTHER STREET - EARLY EVENING 6
A darker, more secluded street, canopied under looming trees.
Isabel marches down the road in her prom dress, eyes straight
ahead.
WE REVERSE CLOSE ON:
THE BACK OF HER HEAD.
We bump up and down with her steps, focused on a small PINK
TATTOO on the nape of her neck.
It's an ancient symbol - Greek or something... It looks like
the left-half of the letter 'Y'

ADULT OWEN (V.O.)
But I couldn't help myself...
7 EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD - NIGHT 7
It's pretty dark, but we can still make out the yard lines
painted on this freshly-sprinklered high school football
field. And the yellow GOAL POST looming out in the distance,
like a giant palm opened up towards the night sky.
Isabel marches across the field, headed towards the end zone.
ADULT OWEN (V.O.)
I started with episode 204, "The
Curse of Mr. Swirly." The ice cream
man who couldn’t stop turning kids
into soft serve...
She stops in the middle of the field, as if she's just
noticed something ahead of her. She raises her open palm into
the air to WAVE.
ADULT OWEN (V.O.)
That first one I watched. That
first night in Maddy's basement.
REVERSE TOWARDS:
The end zone.
TARA, also 16, short-haired and androgynous in a button-down
shirt, leans against the goal post, a SHOVEL in hand.
She doesn't wave back.
She looks more somber than Isabel. She just stares out at her
friend from across the field
A LIGHT FLICKERS BEHIND HER, beyond the end zone. A glowing
spotlight pointed up towards heaven, flickering like a TV
signal.
WE TRAVEL TOWARDS IT…
8 EXT. UNDER THE FOOTBALL FIELD - NIGHT 8
A SMALLER, DARKER FIELD. This one overgrown and unkempt, all
grass, dirt, and weeds, like the evil twin of the perfectly
manicured football field above.
We crane down, towards:

      6.
A HOLE dug deep into the ground.
And that BRILLIANT, UNNATURAL LIGHT FLICKERING up from its
depths.
Its colors blink between grey, white, and blue, as if
broadcasting a television signal from deep below the Earth.
We descend further towards this brilliant television light.
But before we can get too close...
HARD CUT TO:
9 INT. HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - AFTERNOON 9
It's like someone just changed the channel on us without
warning.
Now we're in a high school hallway, after school.
ISABEL has cornered a JOCK, 16, up against a locker. She's
interrogating him.
ISABEL
What did you do? I need you to tell
me what you did.
The Jock laughs uncomfortably, trying to mask how intimidated
he is by this girl half his size.
JOCK
I just made a wish. I was bummed
that the ice cream man had to leave
at the end of the summer. So I made
a wish.
On Isabel's expression: that is exactly what she didn't want
to hear.
ISABEL
(like he's an idiot)
You made a wish. On the night of
the full moon?
The Jock's eyes dart back and forth. He's shaken.
JOCK
I--I'm not sure. I don't keep track
of the moon calendar like some sort
of... moon freak.

ISABEL
Listen to me. This is very
important...
CLOSE ON ISABEL'S TERRIFIED EXPRESSION:
ISABEL (CONT'D)
You need to tell me what you wished
for.
CUT TO:
10 INT. A CHILD'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 10
An ice cream cone nightlight is plugged into the wall. It
looks just like the soft-serve head on the ice cream truck we
just saw spinning earlier. It's head is spinning a rickety
music box pattern as well.
A little KID, 9, is tucked under Mr. Swirly branded covers,
but still wide awake in bed.
That's because he knows SOMETHING ELSE is in the room with
him. He stares at a light left on in his CLOSET, the door
creaking open just a sliver.
The kid sits up slowly in bed, squinting into the blackness
of the room in front of him.
And then, from just inches away from his bed, SOMETHING
EMERGES SUDDENLY:
AN ICE CREAM MAN. A literal, dripping ICE CREAM MAN, like the
top of that ice cream truck from earlier come to horrifying
life.
The cone head now gruesomely realistic, sprinkles flaking out
onto the bedsheets below.
MR. SWIRLY'S eyes are caverns. His grin is pure malevolence.
His teeth are very, very sharp.
He stares at us for a few seconds, then holds something out
for the terrified kid in bed:
A MELTING BLUE ICE POP.
ICE CREAM MONSTER
Here's your Swirly Stick...
A moment of silence. And then...
Mr. Swirly POUNCES towards the bed, and just as he attacks:

CUT TO:
11 EXT. WOODS - NIGHT 11
Years later, now.
ADULT OWEN, looking somewhere between his twenties and the
onset of middle-age, walks alone through the forest at night.
Leaves and sticks crackle under his footsteps, eventually
giving way to:
12 EXT. FIRE PIT - NIGHT 12
The similar crackle of a fledgling FIRE, the flames just
starting to rise up from the innards of a fire pit.
Owen tends to the fire, all alone at what appears to be a
long abandoned campsite.
He takes out a small fabric pouch and tosses some DUST into
the fire. The flames JUMP momentarily.
CUT TO:
LATER.
The fire is really burning now, bathing Owen in a sickly
orange glow. Owen sits on a log next to the fire pit.
He's lost in thought: here, but also clearly somewhere else
far away.
We hold on Owen’s expression for awhile as the glow of the
flames dance across his face.
And then, eventually, we drift back...
13 INT. HIGH SCHOOL COMMONS - NIGHT, 1996 13
To YOUNG OWEN, around 13 now - that anxious in-between time
just before puberty really kicks in.

He's walking, zig-zagging in no particular direction through
a sea of adult torsos, just as lost as he was back in the
chaos of the parachute.
TITLE ON SCREEN:
1996
It's ELECTION NIGHT at the local high school. One of the
school's common areas has been transformed into a VOTING
SITE.
Parents wait in line at various registration tables,
gossiping with each other, eating snacks from a bake sale put
on by the school's jazz band.
Owen weaves past the lines of adults. Someone has caught his
eye in the corner of the room --
MADDY, 15, gothy and nerdy yet confident, sitting on the
linoleum floor reading an oversized book.
Owen's close enough to see the cover of Maddy's book:
It's an EPISODE GUIDE for THE PINK OPAQUE. That TV show Owen
heard a preview for earlier.
Maddy feels eyes on her. She glances up at Owen.
BRENDA (O.S.)
Owen, honey!
BRENDA, 45, Owen's mom, is calling to him from a conversation
with another local PARENT.
BRENDA (CONT'D)
Come on: we're ready to go in.
Owen glances back at Maddy just in time to see that she's
gotten up and is now exiting the room, heading deeper into
the school.
Owen hustles over towards his mom. She nods to the woman next
to her.
BRENDA (CONT'D)
I'll find you after. I want to hear
about the renovations.
Brenda ushers Owen towards a VOTING BOOTH.

14 INT. VOTING BOOTH - MOMENTS LATER 14
We're behind the cloth curtain now.
Brenda lifts her son up to pull the levers for her.
BRENDA
I know you're not too old for this.
He is, and he looks vaguely embarrassed.
BRENDA (CONT'D)
It's been four years - aren't you
excited to vote for the saxophone
man again?
OWEN
Mom...
Owen brushes his fingers across the various levers,
uncomfortable.
15 INT. SCHOOL COMMONS - LATER 15
Brenda has joined a gaggle of parents by the bake sale table,
her civic duty now complete.
But Owen's somewhere else now:
16 INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 16
A hallway, dark and all shut down for the night.
Owen walks slowly down the hall. It's eerily quiet, a world
away from the carnival of election night we just passed
through.
17 INT. SCHOOL CAFETERIA - CONTINUOUS 17
All of the lunch room tables have been broken down and turned
over for the night. Their legs point up into the air like
turtles stuck on their shells.
Owen wanders past a glowing vending machine, towards MADDY.
YOUNG OWEN
Hey.
Maddy sits on one of those turned-over lunch tables reading
her Pink Opaque episode guide.

She stares up at Owen, unsure of who this younger kid is
speaking to her.
MADDY
...Hey.
YOUNG OWEN
Are your parents voting too?
Maddy hesitates a moment, then she shakes her head with a
disaffected shrug.
MADDY
No.
A short beat.
MADDY (CONT'D)
Ms. Driscoll lets me use the dark
room after school. I'm waiting for
my pictures to dry out.
Owen's got his eyes on the book in her lap.
YOUNG OWEN
Is that "The Pink Opaque?"
Maddy glances down at her book.
MADDY
Oh. Yeah. It's the official episode
guide.
Owen stands there in front of her, gawking.
MADDY (CONT'D)
Do you watch?
Owen shakes his head bashfully.
YOUNG OWEN
Nah.
MADDY
Oh.
A long silence between them. Conversation over?
Owen walks across the room, searching for a casual spot to
sit. He doesn't want to let on that he's just followed Maddy
here to talk to her.

Maddy looks back down at her book to keep reading. Owen
settles into a spot in the corner wedged between two vending
machines.
YOUNG OWEN
What grade are you in?
MADDY
(while reading)
...Ninth.
She finishes the sentence she's reading, then glances over
briefly at Owen from across the lunch room, as if assessing
him.
MADDY (CONT'D)
What about you?
YOUNG OWEN
Seventh.
She snorts in quick laughter.
MADDY
Oh my gosh. You're a baby.
Owen looks down at the linoleum, ashamed.
Maddy notices and feels bad. So she tries to change the
subject.
MADDY (CONT'D)
--Election night is cool, right?
It's like Colonial Day, or when
they bring in the inflatable
planetarium to the gymnasium.
Owen nods, not really following her train of thought but
pretending like he is.
MADDY (CONT'D)
It's like the school gets
transformed into something else,
you know? It's special.
YOUNG OWEN
It's a kid's show, right?
He motions towards her episode guide.
YOUNG OWEN (CONT'D)
"The Pink Opaque."

MADDY
No. No way.
Maddy says it like she's almost offended by the question.
MADDY (CONT'D)
I mean, technically, yeah, it's on
the young adult network. But it's
way too scary and the mythology is
way too complicated for most kids.
YOUNG OWEN
I see commercials for it all the
time. It looks amazing.
Maddy hesitates a moment. Then she gets up and walks over to
Owen.
She offers him the book.
MADDY
You can read about the episodes in
here, if you want.
He takes it from her and looks down at the cover. It features
a promotional still of ISABEL and TARA (the two girls we saw
in the opening sequence) looking all heroic and superhero-y.
Maddy settles into a spot across from him, nestled against
the parallel vending machine. Closer to him now.
MADDY (CONT'D)
It's got quotes and pictures. And
info about the "musical guests”
that play each week at The Embargo.
Owen thumbs through the pages.
YOUNG OWEN
It's on at 10:30pm, right?
MADDY
Yeah. Every Saturday night. The
last show in the block before they
switch to black-and-white reruns
for old people. My friends
Christine, Amanda, and I watch it
together every week.
Owen finishes thumbing through the book. He closes it and
hands it back to her, the two of them now bathed in the glow
of twin vending machines.

YOUNG OWEN
My dad doesn't let me stay up that
late. 10pm's my bedtime.
MADDY
Damn. That absolutely sucks.
He looks down at the ground, embarrassed again.
MADDY (CONT'D)
My mom basically doesn't give a
shit when I go to bed.
Maddy looks at Owen as Owen sulks. A bad idea starts to form
in her head. She grins.
MADDY (CONT'D)
Hey: you know what you should do?
Owen looks up, on pins and needles for what Maddy might say
next...
18 INT. BRENDA'S CAR - NIGHT 18
Owen lays in the backseat of his mom's car, driving home from
election night. Streetlights reflect through the window and
dance across his face.
YOUNG OWEN
...Mom?
Owen tries to catch his mom's eyes in the rear view.
YOUNG OWEN (CONT'D)
Can I sleepover at Johnny Link's
house Saturday night?
BRENDA
Johnny Link? I didn't know you guys
were friends anymore.
Owen doesn't respond. He just waits for an answer.
Brenda considers the request...
BRENDA (O.S.) (CONT'D)
You'll need to ask your father.
Beat. Silence.
YOUNG OWEN
Can you ask him for me?

More silence from the front seat.
Streetlights continue to dance in shadows across Owen's face.
19 INT. OWEN'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 19
Brenda lets the two of them back into the house through the
front door.
Owen scurries quickly up the stairs towards the second floor
while Brenda heads towards the living room.
A TV LIGHT blinks From inside.cOwen’s unseen father is in
there watching the screen…
20 INT. OWEN'S HOUSE, SECOND FLOOR - CONTINUOUS 20
Owen hides at the top of the stairs, eavesdropping on his
parents’ conversation below. The sound of their voices is
muffled by the TV drone, but Owen can hear certain words as
his mother negotiates on his behalf:
“Sleepover,” “old enough,” “he’s a good kid, Frank…”
Owen doesn’t move a muscle as he listens…
SLOW DISSOLVE TO:
21 EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - NIGHT 21
We drift back out into the suburban night, across front lawns
and power lines.
The streetlight's yellow glow tints and warms the gravel of
the road, as if this whole town is one big electric-powered
incubator.
SLOW DISSOLVE TO:
22 EXT. JOHNNY LINK'S HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON 22
Another day. Another side of town. The houses here are more
spread out, surrounded by woods.
Brenda is parked by the curb.
Owen walks from the car across Johnny Link's front yard,
sleeping bag still clutched under his armpit.
He's almost tiptoeing, as if on a stealth mission.

BRENDA (O.S.)
Honey?!
Owen winces at his mom's loud voice. She's rolled down the
window, and is calling out to him from the car.
He glances back towards her.
BRENDA (CONT'D)
You remembered your inhaler, right?
Owen nods, answering tersely and quietly:
YOUNG OWEN
Yeah.
Satisfied, his mom rolls her window back up.
Owen continues walking lightly across the grass. He heads up
the driveway and onto the porch.
Now at the front door, he reaches his hand out to ring the
doorbell.
But instead of actually ringing it, he just BRUSHES HIS
FINGERS OVER THE BUTTON.
He waits a few seconds, then glances back towards his mom,
still parked at the curb, waiting to make sure he gets safely
inside.
He waves to her, like, "I'm fine."
She doesn't move. Owen waits a few seconds more, then waves
at her again.
Finally, she takes the hint. She leisurely shifts the car out
of park and DRIVES AWAY.
Owen sighs with relief and waits a little longer by the
door.
Then, when he's sure the coast is clear, he hops off the
porch and rushes across Johnny Link's yard.
23 EXT. SUBURBAN BACKYARDS - MOMENTS LATER 23
Owen speedwalks down a row of nearly identical backyards, his
sleeping bag still tucked snug under his arm.
He walks past empty patios and drained swimming pools.
The sun sets over suburbia as a LIGHT RAIN begins to fall.

24 EXT. MADDY'S BACKYARD - EARLY EVENING 24
Owen ducks under a patio, shielding himself from the rain.
He can hear the faint sound of a television from the other
end of the basement door, but the glass is all fogged up so
it's impossible to see inside.
Owen KNOCKS and waits. No answer.
He glances from side-to-side, like he's suspicious this is
all some prank.
He thinks for a moment longer, then, he slides open the glass
door. He's clearly terrified, but trying his hardest to act
nonchalant.
25 INT. MADDY'S BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS 25
AMANDA and CHRISTINE, both 15, sit on a couch painting each
other's toenails with pink nail polish.
They've both got a vaguely mall goth style, but in a kind of
flakey way, as if they could revert to their natural
'cheerleader' status at the drop of a hat.
They half watch the end credits of a cartoon on the
television screen at the front of the room, and hardly
acknowledge Owen's presence as he steps into the room.
He lingers near the doorway. It's like he's just intruded on
some intimate scene he has no right witnessing.
YOUNG OWEN
Is uh... is this Maddy's house?
The girls on the couch finally look over at him. Then they
turn back to each other and laugh, as if sharing some
inscrutable inside joke where Owen is the punchline.
Owen continues to linger in the doorway, dripping wet from
the rain outside, unsure what to do.
Slowly, he moves to take off his sneakers.
ON THE TV -- COMMERCIALS blink out across the room. Right
now, an ad for a kid's magazine that comes with a free
decoder ring.
A door opens near the top of the stairs. Owen glances up as
Maddy steps into the room.

FROM THE UNSEEN TELEVISION SCREEN we can hear the show
starting. The Pink Opaque's eerie synth theme song begins to
bellow out across the room.
ISABEL (V.O.)
(from the screen)
Tara is my imaginary best friend.
And I'm hers.
Maddy closes the door behind her, and carries a bowl of
colored popcorn with her into the basement. Amanda and
Christine grin at her from the couch.
AMANDA
(calling to her)
Your suitor has arrived.
Maddy glances for half a second at Owen, and then focuses
back on the TV screen.
MADDY
Shut up. It's starting.
ISABEL (V.O.)
(from the screen)
We met at sleepaway camp and
discovered we had an ancient
psychic connection.
Maddy flips off the light-switch, and suddenly, the room is
lit entirely by television light.
Owen continues to linger by the door, like everyone else in
the room his eyes are squarely on the unseen TV screen.
ISABEL (V.O.)
(from the screen)
Now, even though we live on
opposite sides of the county, we
help each other fight the forces of
evil.
Maddy hands Christine her bowl of popcorn and then hops over
the back of the couch to sit with her friends.
Owen finishes taking off his shoes and then walks deeper into
the room, as if the show is an invitation to join them near
the couch.
ISABEL (O.S.)

We are... The Pink Opaque.

The show's LOGO floats towards us. Big, brilliant, and very
Nickelodeon.
The theme song plays.
CUT TO:
27 INT. MADDY'S BASEMENT - LATER 27
Maddy shares the couch with Amanda and Christine, their legs
all splayed out over each other's laps.
Owen sits alone on the floor, back against the wall, staring
ahead at the unseen television. Even though his spot down
there looks uncomfortable, he couldn't care less. He's
utterly transfixed by what he sees on the screen.
FROM THE TELEVISION WE CAN HEAR: the familiar sounds of Mr.
Swirly's ice-cream truck.
WE CUT INTO THE SHOW ONCE AGAIN.
NOTE: When we watch The Pink Opaque, we are always watching
it full-screen, as if there is no distinction between the
show and the rest of the film we're watching. Though there
are subtle hints of the pastiche of early 90s television in
The Pink Opaque, it is shot in the same cinematic style as
the rest of the film.

away.
We crane up from their spot on the pavement, high into the
evening sky.
We DISSOLVE, journeying higher and higher into the bright,
romantic, eerie cosmos, until finally we've arrived at:
THE MOON. Full and brilliant tonight.
But there's something WRONG with the moon:
It has a GRINNING FACE. Like from the old silent film 'A Trip
to the Moon.'
The Man in the Moon LAUGHS wickedly at us, eager to grant
this wish he's overheard.
CUT TO:
29 EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - NIGHT 29
An ICE CREAM TRUCK (the same one we saw at the beginning of
the film) is parked in the middle of the road, in the middle
of the night.

It's GLOWING unnaturally, as if in the midst of some awful
transformation..
Neon PINK and PURPLE fluorescents spark from inside. COLORED
SMOKE pours out from the windows.
The synth score goes WILD.
And CLOSER TO THE TRUCK NOW, through the window kids order
their ice cream through…
A HAND WRITHES UPWARDS, gripping the counter.
It’s not quite human anymore. It drips with mushy sprinkles
as it continues to TRANSFORM INTO SOFT SERVE.
CUT TO:
30 INT. MADDY'S BASEMENT - LATER 30
We're back in Maddy's basement now, shortly after the show
has ended.
THROUGH THE WINDOW -- the reflection of the television, now
turned off.
And Amanda and Christine, hanging together under the porch
light, sharing a single Black & Mild cigarette. They pass it
back and forth like a holy object.
Owen stares out at them while he sets up his sleeping bag on
the carpet of Maddy's basement. Maddy leans against the back
of her couch, watching him.
MADDY
You can go out and join them if you
want.
It takes Owen a second to respond. He seems dazed, like he's
still living inside that show he just watched.
YOUNG OWEN
Oh. No. I don't smoke cigarettes.
MADDY
It's not a cigarette. It's a Black
and Mild.
Owen shrugs, pretending like he knows the difference.
THROUGH THE WINDOW -- a car pulls up to the curb past Maddy's
lawn, headlights beaming out into the night.

Amanda and Christine stomp out their Black and Mild and run
across the grass.
MADDY (CONT'D)
You sure you don't want a ride home
with Amanda's mom?
OWEN
...I told my parents it was a
sleepover.
Maddy nods, studying this kid in her basement.
Owen watches Maddy's best friends get into the backseat of
the car and disappear into the night.
Now they're all alone down here.
Suddenly the space feels very intimate. Owen's nervous.
Maddy's not.
MADDY
Did you like it? The show I mean?
OWEN
(playing it cool)
Oh yeah. It was... really
interesting.
Maddy wanders through the space, cleaning up. As she works,
she starts to ramble on about The Pink Opaque. This is
clearly her favorite topic.
MADDY
Isabel's a scaredy-cat. She's kind
of the main character, but she's
also kind of a drip.
Owen glances back to look at her, clearly interested.
MADDY (CONT'D)
Tara's my favorite. She's super
hot, and she doesn't take shit from
anybody. Plus - she's an expert on
demonology.
YOUNG OWEN
And they never meet up in person?
MADDY
Nah. Just in the very first
episode, back at sleepaway camp. (MORE)

But they can communicate via "the
psychic plane." Each episode they
help each other fight a new monster
from across the county.
YOUNG OWEN
Okay.
He's hanging on every word, trying to soak up as much info
about the show as Maddy is willing to give him.
YOUNG OWEN (CONT'D)
Is the ice cream man in every
episode?
Maddy snorts like this is an idiotic question as she settles
once again against the back of the couch above Owen.
MADDY
Ha. No. He's just a Monster of the
Week. Mr. Melancholy is the big
bad.
YOUNG OWEN
Mr. Melancholy?
MADDY
(duh)
The Man in the Moon.
OWEN
Oh... Right.
Owen unzips his sleeping bag.
MADDY
He's always messing with time and
reality. He wants to rule the
world, to trap Isabel and Tara in
The Midnight Realm. So each week he
sends a new supernatural foe their
way.
YOUNG OWEN
Because they're part of "The Pink
Opaque."
MADDY
No. Because they are The Pink
Opaque.
YOUNG OWEN
Oh. Right. Sorry.

MADDY
Don't apologize.
Maddy side eyes him, like she's annoyed by his apology.
Owen glances down at the carpet.
Silence. Then --
Maddy gets up from the top of the couch and walks across the
room.
For a moment it seems like she's heading over towards Owen on
the floor. But then she keeps walking past him towards the
staircase.
MADDY (CONT'D)
All right. Well I'm passing out.
He calls after her:
YOUNG OWEN
Are you really sure it's okay that
I sleep down here?
MADDY
Just be out by dawn. If my stepdad
catches you he'll break my nose
again.
Maddy says this nonchalantly. Owen's not really sure how to
respond to this.
So he just starts to get inside his sleeping bag as Maddy
reaches the top of the stairs.
YOUNG OWEN
(calling up to her,
insecure)
And where are you going to sleep?
MADDY
In my bed. Creep.
Maddy abruptly flips off the lightswitch, draping the room in
darkness.
Owen settles into place on the floor, getting ready for
sleep.
But he notices:
Maddy, still lingering at the top of the stairs, like she's
not quite ready to leave yet.

It's silent for a long time, and then Maddy speaks again.
Her tone of voice has changed. It's hushed, less confident,
as if she's speaking aloud her darkest, most vulnerable
secret.
MADDY (CONT'D)
Sometimes I think The Pink Opaque
feels more real than real life. You
know?
Owen lies there on the floor, unsure how to respond.
And then --
Maddy opens the basement door. She leaves the room, shutting
the door behind her.
Owen lies there in the darkness, now alone, Maddy's words
echoing in his mind amidst the silence of the basement.
31 INT. MADDY'S BASEMENT - MORNING 31
Light peaks into the room.
Owen stirs awake in the dawn light.
CUT TO:
Owen crouching over his sleeping bag, rolling it back up into
a ball.
He's getting ready to leave. He's up early, before the rest
of the town.
After a few seconds of silent work, he glances up... and
LOOKS INTO THE CAMERA.
He speaks to us directly, suddenly transforming into the
film's narrator.
When he speaks directly to camera, his tone is DIFFERENT. As
if Adult Owen is channeling through his younger self.
YOUNG OWEN

Two summers later, Maddy Wilson
disappeared without a trace.

32 EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - MORNING 32
Young Owen walks across the backyards of the suburbs once
again, this time in the opposite direction back towards
Johnny Link's house. He's got his sleeping bag tucked under
his arm.
The grass is wet with rain from the night before.
He narrates directly to the camera once again:
YOUNG OWEN
No one had any idea where she went.
Not her mother, not her stepdad,
not anybody.
The day is bright and peaceful. A perfect Sunday morning.
But we slowly DISSOLVE to:
33 EXT. MADDIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT 33
HEAVY RAIN.
POLICE LIGHTS strobing across the suburban night.
A number of COP CARS are parked on the curb outside Maddy's
house, which is now sectioned off with YELLOW POLICE TAPE.
YOUNG OWEN (V.O.)
She didn't leave a note, and they
never found a body.
A small crowd has gathered in the street. Among them:
TEENAGED OWEN, now 15. He lingers near the back of the crowd,
letting the shadows and the rain keep him anonymous.
He finishes his own thought that we just heard in voice-over,
direct to camera:
TEEN OWEN
All they found was her TV set
burning in the backyard.
34 EXT. MADDY'S BACKYARD - EARLY EVENING 34
FLAMES ENGULF MADDY'S CRT TELEVISION out on the grass near
her back patio.
It burns orange and brilliant, an inferno of melting
electricity.

We push closer and closer towards the set, until we can
almost feel the heat.
TEEN OWEN (V.O.)
And the strangest part of it all
was: that exact same month that
Maddy disappeared, The Pink Opaque
got canceled.
We draw closer to the flames, until SUDDENLY:
A34 EXT. WOODS - NIGHT A34
We're back with Adult Owen alone at that burning fire he's
started in the woods.
He sits there silently, communing with the past, mournfully
remembering...
35 EXT. JOHNNY LINK'S HOUSE - MORNING 35
And now we're back decades earlier with Young Owen, on that
calm morning after that first sleepover at Maddy's.
He waits on the porch outside Johnny Link's house, as if he
spent the night there.
His mom pulls up to the curb to pick him up.
Owen hustles across the lawn and lets himself into the
backseat.
BRENDA
You have a fun time?
YOUNG OWEN
It was cool.
We watch from across the yard as:
He shuts the car door behind him and buckles up.
Brenda starts the car. A mattress commercial plays from the
car radio.
His mom pulls away, but we don't follow the car. Instead, we
linger here on Johnny Link's lawn, looking out at the
peaceful, empty cul de sac across the street.
The pavement is covered with more Pollack-esque chalk
scribblings in pink and purple.

We hold on this Sunday morning still life.
Even though Brenda's car is gone, we can still hear the
MATTRESS COMMERCIAL that was playing on her car radio.
It grows louder. Uncomfortably so, even.
It's deafening now, distorted, Satanic, draped by awful radio
static...
SUDDENLY --
The camera DROPS OUT, as if someone has kicked away the
tripod.
As we topple towards the pavement, we very quickly:
CUT TO:
36 INT. OWEN'S CAR - NIGHT, 2006 36
Another time entirely.
We're now riding in Brenda’s old car with ADULT OWEN, 24, as
he pulls into a parking lot and up towards a fast food drive￾thru window.
He's wearing a uniform and a nametag. It's hard to get too
good a look at his face in the darkness of his car.
DRIVE-THRU KID (V.O.)
(muffled)
Welcome to Burger Express.
ADULT OWEN
Hello?
DRIVE-THRU KID (V.O.)
...Hi.
A pause.
ADULT OWEN
Are you ready to take my
order--
DRIVE-THRU KID
What would you like, sir?
Owen winces to himself. He waits too long before trying
again:
DRIVE-THRU KID (CONT'D)
Are you there?
ADULT OWEN (CONT'D)
Yeah let me get--
Ugh. Owen waits again.

ADULT OWEN (CONT'D)

two double cheeseburgers and a
small fries.
A long pause. Owen stares into the anonymous speaker system
in front of him, waiting for a response.
DRIVE-THRU KID
...$4.14. Drive around.
ADULT OWEN
Okay. Okay -- thanks.
We travel with Owen inside the car for the entire loop around
the back of the drive-thru.
As he pulls under the light of the pickup window, we get a
good look at him:
He looks frail and a little bit unwell. He's the same
anxious, introverted kid from earlier, just older now, and
more tired.
He slows down at the drive-thru window to grab his paper-bag
dinner from the kid inside.
ADULT OWEN (CONT'D)
Sorry about earlier.
The kid looks confused, unsure of what Owen is apologizing
for.
ADULT OWEN (CONT'D)
(trying to remind him)
We kept speaking at the same time.
The kid just stares at him, dead-eyed.
37 EXT. MOVIE THEATER PARKING LOT - NIGHT 37
A small, sorta rundown single-screen movie theater in a huge,
mostly empty parking lot.
TITLE ON SCREEN:

Owen parks his car, locks it behind him, and carries his fast
food bag through the parking lot, past abandoned shopping
carts.

A gaggle of SENIOR CITIZENS have congregated. They look
confused and angry.
As Owen approaches them, they pounce.
SENIOR CITIZEN MOVIEGOER
You're late!
SENIOR CITIZEN MOVIEGOER 2
It starts in five minutes.
ADULT OWEN
The manager's not in there?
SENIOR CITIZEN MOVIEGOER
It's locked!
Owen looks tired and annoyed as he gets out his keys.
SENIOR CITIZEN MOVIEGOER 2
We're going to miss our movie!
ADULT OWEN
I start the movie. You're not going
to miss your movie.
He unlocks the door.
SENIOR CITIZEN MOVIEGOER 2
(to her friend)
We should have gone to the Fun
Center instead.
38 INT. MOVIE THEATER BACK ROOM 38
Owen is on his flip phone. He walks through a hallway in the
theater's cluttered, staff-only, back area.
ADULT OWEN
(leaving a message)
--Got here and the doors were
locked. I tried Dave on his cell
phone and he's not answering. And
you know I can't start the
projector without a key to...
Owen opens the door to an office to find:
DAVE, 40, his manager, sitting in a chair getting a BLOWJOB
from a half-naked WOMAN, 35, knelt on the ground.
Owen gawks, stunned. Dave BURSTS OUT LAUGHING at the
unexpected intrusion.

Owen paces outside the office, his cheeks red.

41 INT. MOVIE THEATER BACKROOM - NIGHT 41
Owen eats his lukewarm fast food in a backroom near the
projection booth. We can hear the projector rattling up here.
Dave, his boss, sits near him along with a TEENAGE MOVIE
THEATER EMPLOYEE. They're both eating their own fast food
takeout.
DAVE
Owen, you uh, liked what you saw
earlier? Me and Erica?
The teenage employee snorts quietly, trying to hold in his
laughter.
Owen takes another bite of his cheeseburger and ignores the
question.
DAVE (CONT'D)
If you want I could put in a good
word for you with Erica. I think
you've got a chance.
The teenage employee is giggling now. And Dave is holding in
laughter too --
DAVE (CONT'D)
She can't stop asking about you.

They both crack up.
42 INT. MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT 42
Owen walks with a flashlight through a dark theater, making
the rounds.
He's a silhouette against the screen, which is playing a
BRASH and CHAOTIC CGI SCENE of two GIANT ROBOTS flying around
the sky and bashing the shit out of each other.
The CGI looks kind of dated, in that way that movies from the
recent past sometimes do.
Owen reaches the front of the theater, then turns around and
heads back up the aisle, a shadow against the ballet of
destruction up on screen.
43 OMITTED 43
44 INT. OWEN'S CAR - NIGHT 44
Now Owen drives home down a secluded local road. The sound of
commercials low on the radio once again.
Something on the road ahead catches his eye:
A WHITE ELECTRIC SPARK flickering off the pavement.
Owen squints, unsure what he's looking at.
It almost looks like static from a television. Or like that
light we saw coming out from the hole in the ground in the
opening sequence of the film.
As Owen gets closer to the light, he slows to a stop.
45 EXT. SECLUDED ROAD - CONTINUOUS 45
Owen gets out of the car, not bothering to shut the driver's
door behind him. There's no one else out on the road at this
hour.
He walks slowly around the front of his car, heading towards
the blinking electric light ahead of him:
It's a DOWNED POWER LINE, splayed out across the road.

      33.
It appears that an animal has chewed away the middle of the
wiring. Now, it's shooting ELECTRIC SPARKS up from the
pavement into the air.
The power line spasms and dances against the ground, the
electricity powering its jolts.
Owen stares down at the light, and he notices something else
there in the dark of the street:
BURNT PAPER.
Stray PAGES from an oversized book idling in the wind, all
faded and browned around the edges, as if saved from a fire.
Owen crouches down and picks one of the pages up. He squints
down at it and discovers:
It's from THE PINK OPAQUE EPISODE GUIDE. That book Maddy was
reading years ago in the school on election night
This particular page details a plot summary for an episode
titled "Homecoming to Get You." It features a big black-and￾white photo of Isabel in her prom dress holding her axe at a
high school dance.
More pages blow past. Owen grabs a handful, and thumbs
through them: another episode titled, "The Clown from the
Carnival." And then one for an episode titled "Escape from
the Midnight Realm, Part 1."
Owen notices the FRONT COVER of the episode guide lying
nearby too, all ripped up and burnt.
He stays crouched there in the isolated street, surrounded by
burnt pages and the sporadic ELECTRIC SPARK from the downed
power line...

49 INT. OWEN'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 49
Later now, as Owen walks into his home. He drops his car keys
in a bowl by the front door.
It's the same living room we saw him in as a child. Not much
has changed, except that the TV has gotten a little bit
bigger.
Owen walks past the staircase and peaks into the living room.
His FATHER is asleep on the couch. The years have not been
kind to FRANK. He appears somewhat incapacitated there on the
couch, his face pale like a living ghost.
The TV blinks its light across his face. From the screen, we
can hear --
The sound of a classic 'TV Land' sorta show. Think 'All in
the Family.'
Owen glances at the screen, then at his father.
ADULT OWEN
You need help getting upstairs?
Frank stirs awake. He stares at his son but doesn't speak.
ADULT OWEN (CONT'D)
I'm sorry I'm late. There was a
downed power line...
There's something intimidating and disquieting about Frank's
stare. Like he only half recognizes his son.
Frank never responds. Instead, he eventually just settles
back down to sleep.
Owen stands there on the periphery of the living room for a
few moments, then turns to head upstairs.
50 INT. OWEN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 50
Owen inhales a puff from his ASTHMA INHALER.
He holds the inhaler in his hands. He allows his breathing to
return to normal.
He's sitting on the edge of his bed in his dark bedroom.
From downstairs, we can still hear the sound of the sitcom on
TV.

Owen picks up a remote control and flips on his own TV on a
nightstand near his bed.
He changes channels, then settles on what sounds like a late
night talk show.
The TV glow dances across his face now too, just like his
father downstairs.
He settles into bed as we DRIFT towards:
His bedroom window.
51 EXT. OWEN'S HOUSE - NIGHT 51
And now we're outside his house, on a patch of grass near a
streetlamp across the street.
SOMEONE IS WATCHING FROM OUTSIDE.
A WOMAN. Staring up at Owen's house. At the twin TVs glowing
on each level of the otherwise dark home.
This mystery woman has her back turned to us, so we can't
tell for certain who it is.
Eventually though, we reverse to reveal:
MADDY.
Older and more confident, in a button down shirt that
resembles Tara's clothing from The Pink Opaque.
She glares ahead at Owen's house with authority and purpose,
like a spy here on a secret mission.
She continues to stare ahead towards the dark house. Then:
She turns and walks away, departing down the road into the
abyss of the suburban night.
And now it's just us out here. Alone, watching the twin TVs
flickering through the windows on each level of the house.
DISSOLVE TO:
52 EXT. SLEEPAWAY CAMP - EARLY EVENING 52

field in the foggy dusk at her sleepaway camp.

The field is still all set up from a game of Capture the Flag
earlier in the day.
But Isabel's the only one out now, all by herself on her
seemingly abandoned camp grounds.
We hear Maddy in voice-over, as if speaking to us through a
dream--
MADDY (V.O.)
Watch the show. Just keep watching
the show.
53 OMITTED 53
54 EXT. CARNIVAL - NIGHT 54
Owen wanders through a county fair, lost in the colored
lights and caffeinated buzz surrounding him. He seems more
dazed than excited.
TITLE ON SCREEN:
1998
INSERT SHOTS OF:
The neon chaos of the fair...
SPINNING RIDES and TEENAGERS aggressively facing off against
each other at game booths, spraying water into cardboard
clown mouths, ring tossing, winning tiny goldfish in ziplock
bags.
And Brenda (Owen's mom) by a snack booth, eavesdropping with
concern on her son as he wanders aimlessly all alone through
the fairgrounds.
Something has changed about Brenda since we last saw her:
She's looking pale. Her head is shaved. She wears a snood hat
to cover her baldness.
BRENDA (V.O.)
How are you doing these days,

Owen and Brenda lean together against a fence outside the
spinning Gravitron 5000 ride. Owen picks at a big bushel of
COTTON CANDY.
TEEN OWEN
I'm fine.
Brenda studies her son, trying to get a read on him.
BRENDA
You just seem somewhere else
lately, and I'm not sure if it's
cause of me. I don't know. Maybe
I'm making it up.
Owen lets some spit drop out of his mouth onto his cotton
candy. He watches the blue and pink bushel dissolve back to
sugar with the force of his spit.
BRENDA (CONT'D)
I just want to make sure you're on
the right path, you know?
ON THE SOUNDTRACK: The RUMBLE of the Gravitron ride overtakes
us...
56 INT. GRAVITRON 5000 - NIGHT 56
Now Owen is inside, strapped in and pinned against the wall
for a ride.
Neon colors flash rapidly across his face as he spins. He's
moving at warp speed, so fast that gravity is playing tricks
on him.
He looks like he's going to be sick. He tries to move his
arms and push off the wall, but the velocity of the ride
keeps him pinned there.
There's terror in his eyes as he tries and fails to move.
It's like being trapped somewhere terrible.
TEEN OWEN (V.O.)

Brenda glances back at her son from the passenger seat.
BRENDA
What time's it on?
TEEN OWEN

BRENDA
You know that your bedtime's 10:15.
TEEN OWEN
Yeah but...
Owen glances again into the rearview, daring to make eye
contact.
TEEN OWEN (CONT'D)
No one else in ninth grade even has
a bedtime anymore.
Frank keeps staring ahead at the road for awhile.
And then finally, he speaks:
FRANK
Isn't that a show for girls?
Silence.
Brenda cuts the tension, trying to let Owen down easy:
BRENDA
Not tonight, honey.
Owen looks down at his lap.
End of conversation.
Brenda, her face faded and gaunt from chemotherapy, stares at
the road ahead.

Owen lies in bed, unable to sleep. He rolls over and leans in
to check the alarm clock on his nightstand.
10:48pm.
He lays back down and stares up at the ceiling. Oh that
special particular agony of knowing your favorite show is on
right now but you can't watch it...
Owen sits up, and then:
He looks directly into the camera, addressing us once again
as the movie's narrator.
TEEN OWEN

After that first sleepover, I
couldn't work up the courage to say
more than three words to Maddy
Wilson at a time. But when I told
her I still wasn’t allowed to watch
the show, she started leaving tapes
for me...
59 INT. HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - LATE AFTERNOON 59
It's after school hours. The hallways are mostly empty.
Owen walks past a few KIDS wrestling at their lockers.
We follow him for awhile through the halls, tracking with him
as he enters:
60 INT. HIGH SCHOOL, ART CLASSROOM - CONTINUOUS 60
An empty art classroom. Amateur watercolors sit all dried on
easels. Half-finished pencil still-lives are taped up to the
walls.
Owen walks across the art classroom, and then through a black
curtain, leading into:
61 INT. DARK ROOM - CONTINUOUS 61

Owen is bathed in RICH RED LIGHT, like he's just stepped onto

A VHS TAPE, sitting on the counter right next to the chemical
bath.

scribbled for him:
pilot episode

He stares down at the tape, as if it holds all the mysteries
of life in its innards.

63 INT. OWEN'S KITCHEN - AFTERNOON 63
After school now. Owen sits in the living room, staring down
at his biology homework. He's supposed to be filling in names
of internal organs on a diagram of the human male body.
But he's not doing his homework, really. Instead, he's
waiting, biding his time until--
BRENDA (O.S.)
(calling from the other
room)
Your dad's driving me to my
appointment!
TEEN OWEN
Okay!
Owen listens, waiting patiently as the front door opens and
closes. He waits a few seconds longer for the house to settle
into silence.
Then --
He rushes out of the chair and up the staircase.
64 INT. OWEN'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 64
Owen digs inside his closet, turning over old toys and

Owen feeds the tape labeled "Pilot Episode" into the VHS
player on a small, old CRT TV in his basement.
He kneels on the carpet in front of the television as the
set's blue calibration screen flickers on.
He pauses a moment in front of the screen.
Then, he turns towards us, and:
HE LOOKS DIRECTLY INTO THE CAMERA, suddenly aware of our
presence once again. He speaks to us as the narrator.
TEEN OWEN
(to the camera)
I watched these tapes over and over
again, but they never got old.
CUT TO:
65pt2 LATER. 65pt2
Owen is splayed out on the couch, lights dimmed, staring
ahead at the TV screen.
From the screen - we can hear the pilot episode of The Pink
Opaque playing. The rustling of SOMEONE running through a
forest, accompanied by scary 90s score...
MARCO (O.S.)
(threatening, from the
screen)
MARCO!
POLO (0.S.)
(also from the screen)
POLO!
Owen watches, transfixed.
66 EXT. SUMMER CAMP WOODS - LATE AFTERNOON 66
We cut into the episode.
A scared CAMPER, 13, rushes through the woods, hopelessly
lost. He glances down at a compass in his hands, but the
needle just spins.

LOST CAMPER
Who's there?
Footsteps scatter across the forest floor.
LOST CAMPER (CONT'D)
Please! I'm just trying to get back
to camp...
MARCO (O.S.)
We can help you...
POLO (O.S.)
You just have to follow... the
moon.
MARCO and POLO, two monsters, emerge slowly from the woods.
Their faces are white and crater-like, all jagged and shaped
like CRESCENT MOONS. They wear slick astronaut costumes, as
if NASA collaborated on a new chic line with Gucci.
The LOST CAMPER stares ahead, eyes wide with terror.
He drops his compass into the dirt.
CUT TO:
67 EXT. DOCK BY THE LAKE - NIGHT 67
Isabel is crouched at the edge of a dock at the camp's lake:
a large, shimmering body of water with a small area sectioned
off with buoys for swim practice.
The water sparkles as Isabel stares up at --
THE MOON. Big and brilliant and full in the sky tonight.
And glowing with...
MR. MELANCHOLY'S GRINNING FACE.
Staring menacingly from the sky like he's keeping watch over
this entire world.

TARA (O.S.)
...You can see him too.
Isabel turns around. Tara is approaching her slowly from the
other end of the dock.
TARA (CONT'D)
Not many people can. Most kids look
up at the night sky and all they
see is a big white beach ball.
ISABEL
His henchmen are close by. I can
feel them.
She says it with confusion, as if she's not quite sure how
she knows this fact.
TARA
Marco and Polo. Nasty little
demons.
ISABEL
And he... He's...
She looks back up at the Man in the Moon and thinks harder,
as if trying to remember a forgotten memory.
ISABEL (CONT'D)
Mr. Melancholy.
Tara nods.
TARA
That's right.
She sits on the dock across from Isabel.
ISABEL
What is happening to me? How do I
know these things?
Isabel turns from the moon and looks at Tara with concern.
ISABEL (CONT'D)
Am I going crazy?
TARA
No. Never let anyone convince you
of that.
She says it forcefully.

TARA (CONT'D)
You're like me. You're special.
Tara brushes her hair aside and turns to show Isabel her own
MYSTICAL PINK BIRTHMARK.
It's a match for the symbol on Isabel's neck, except hers
bears the mirror opposite symbol, as if the two birthmarks
could connect together like puzzle pieces.
TARA (CONT'D)
We are The Pink Opaque. It's our
destiny.
On Isabel -- fear and wonder in her eyes. No one has ever
called her special before.
TARA (CONT'D)
I knew it from the moment I first
saw you in the dining hall. Heck,
I knew it before I even met you...
CUT TO:
68 INT. OWEN'S BASEMENT - DAY 68
Owen lies on his side, watching the episode. He speaks along
with the show, softly mouthing Isabel's lines from memory as
she speaks them.
ISABEL (O.S)
(from the screen)
I don't even have my
learner's permit yet. How can
I have a destiny?
TEEN OWEN
I don't even have my
learner's permit yet. How can
I have a destiny?
From upstairs: the sound of the front door opening.
Owen's parents are back home.
Owen jumps up from the couch quickly. He rushes towards the
TV and shuts off the episode abruptly.
He hits EJECT, then grabs the VHS tape out from the machine.
He hides it under his shirt, crouched there alone on the
floor.

70 EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD BLEACHERS - LATE AFTERNOON 70
Maddy sits alone after school on the football field
bleachers, eating a tuna sandwich with the crust cut off.
She’s got the darkened contours of a half-healed black eye,
which she’s tried to cover up with goth makeup.
From all the way across the empty bleachers: Owen approaches,
trying his best once again to feign casualness. Like he’s
just happened to stumble across Maddy up here alone.
TEEN OWEN
Hey.
Maddy glances up at him as he continues to feign nonchalance.
MADDY
What’s up?
She picks at her sandwich. He sits down next to her, a ball
of social anxiety.
TEEN OWEN
(quietly, almost to
himself)
Nothing much…
A long silence. Maddy doesn’t look at Owen as he fidgets
around a bit, working up the courage to ask:
TEEN OWEN (CONT'D)
I was wondering...Do you, uh… do
you, Amanda, and Christine still
watch The Pink Opaque together
every week?
A beat. Maddy looks vaguely annoyed at the question.
MADDY
I haven't talked to either of those
assholes in a year.
Owen looks disappointed.
MADDY (CONT'D)
Amanda told the entire school I
tried to touch her tit, which is a
total lie. And Christine, surprise
surprise, eleventh grade hits and
suddenly it's been her lifelong
dream to join the cheer squad.
Maddy snorts and rolls her eyes, pure spite.

MADDY (CONT'D)
Secret agents sent here to make my

ON OWEN -- working up the courage to ask his next question.
TEEN OWEN
If you wanted... I could come over
again sometime.
Maddy looks at him. Owen's clearly nervous.
TEEN OWEN (CONT'D)
I've been watching the tapes you've
been making me. But I want to see
The Pink Opaque on Saturday night
again. While it airs.
Maddy studies him, trying to figure out his angle here.
MADDY
I like girls. You know that, right?
I'm not into boys.
Owen is immediately nervous, defensive.
TEEN OWEN
I... I know that.
Maddy looks Owen up and down, trying to feel him out.
MADDY
Okay. Just making sure.
A beat of silence. Maddy keeps eying Owen.
MADDY (CONT'D)
What about you? Do you like girls?
Owen looks down through the bleachers.
TEEN OWEN
I don't know...
MADDY
Boys?
Owen just keeps staring down through the bleachers.
He thinks for awhile, like he doesn't know the answer. Then
he half-smiles.
TEEN OWEN
I think I like TV shows.

He says it like a self-effacing joke. But it just sounds sad.
Out in the distance -- some stoner kids in the area below the
football field stamp out their joint and head off in the
other direction, leaving Owen and Maddy completely alone out
here.
OWEN
When I think about that stuff, it
feels like someone took a shovel
and dug out all my insides. And I
know there's nothing in there, but
I'm too nervous to open myself up
and check. I know there's something
wrong with me. My parents see it
too, even if they don't want to say
anything...
Owen looks at Maddy, as if searching for confirmation of
something.
OWEN (CONT'D)
Do you ever feel like that?
Maddy thinks for awhile before responding.
MADDY
I don't know...
Maddy bites her lip.
MADDY (CONT'D)
Maybe you're like Isabel...
ON OWEN -- he ruffles his brow, considering it.
MADDY (CONT'D)
Afraid of what's inside you.
71 EXT. MADDY'S BACKYARD - EARLY EVENING 71
Owen walks across Maddy's backyard, sleeping bag tucked under
his arm.
He glances side-to-side to make sure nobody's watching, then
slides open the glass door to her basement and slips inside.
RISING ON THE SOUNDTRACK: EVIL CLOWN LAUGHTER.

72 EXT. STRIP MALL PARKING LOT 72
Through the side-mirror of a parked car, we can see:
AN EVIL CLOWN MONSTER, holding court in the middle of the
parking lot, giggling and frothing at the mouth like an
absolute maniac.
TARA (O.S)
Hey. Bozo.
CUT TO:
Tara, speed-walking across the parking lot, a large SCYTHE in
hand. She addresses the psychotic clown as she rushes towards
him...
TARA (CONT'D)
Estee Lauder called. They've got a
few suggestions about this whole
"look" you're going for.
She raises her scythe into the air, ready for battle. But
just before she strikes we cut to:
73 INT. MADDY'S BASEMENT - NIGHT 73
Owen and Maddy watching the episode on Maddy's couch. They're
sitting side-by-side, closer together, both lost in the
episode and the glow of the screen.
FROM THE UNSEEN SCREEN WE CAN HEAR:
The sounds of an epic, kind of over-the-top fight scene
between Tara and the evil clown. Lots of GROWLING and
SLICING.
Out of the corner of his eye Owen notices something --
Maddy is CRYING.
Tears roll down her cheeks. Her eyes are red and wet. The
shadow of that black eye still not fully healed.
Owen looks confused. She knows he notices, but she's not able
to cover up her tears.
She keeps her eyes ahead at the screen. She whimpers and
continues to cry harder, a full-bodied emotional response
now.

Owen sits there, unsure of what to say or do...
CUT TO:
73pt2 LATER. Past lights out. 73pt2
Owen is alone in the basement, once again curled up on the
floor in his sleeping bag.
His breathing is slightly and subtly asthmatic.
He's awake, and he's listening to:
NOISES from upstairs in Maddy's house.
It sounds like a heated argument. An angry MAN yelling, and a
WOMAN trying to defend herself.
It's muffled enough so it's hard to hear the exact words, but
it sounds on the edge of violence.
Owen lays there and listens.
The BASEMENT DOOR CREAKS OPEN.
Owen turns on his side, pretending to sleep as Maddy tiptoes
downstairs and takes a seat on the staircase.
She's got something in her hands:
A PINK SHARPIE.
She sits there on the steps, playing idly with the marker.
MADDY
(quietly)
I'm getting out of this town. Did
you know that? Soon.
It's not clear if Maddy is talking to him, or just to
herself.
Owen slowly turns over on his side and squints across the
room at Maddy.
OWEN
What?
MADDY
I'll die if I stay here... I don't
know how exactly, but I know that
it's true.

A long pause. Owen stares at Maddy from his spot on the
floor.
OWEN
(vulnerable)
...I won't have anyone to watch The
Pink Opaque with if you leave.
Owen lies still, staring at Maddy. He turns back over on his
other side, facing away from her now.
A long beat. Then -- Owen can hear Maddy getting back up from
the stairs and walking slowly towards him.
She crouches at his side.
MADDY
Hey.
Owen doesn't speak or move.
MADDY (CONT'D)
Sit up.
Owen does, slowly.
He sits with his back turned to Maddy, not looking at her.
She reaches out and tilts his head down for him.
She uncaps her marker and begins to draw carefully on the
nape of his neck.
She's drawing:
The symbol from the show. The 'half Y' that we've seen on the
back of Isabel and Tara's necks.
Her marker's ink is pink and bright. It glows against the
darkness of the basement.
Owen keeps his head down. They sit there in silence as Maddy
colors in the lines of Owen's new temporary tattoo.
CUT TO:
73pt3 LATER. 73pt3
It's the middle of the night.
Owen and Maddy lay on the floor next to each other. Maddy
fast asleep on her side without a blanket.

And Owen still wide awake, lying on his back inside his
sleeping bag, staring up towards the ceiling.
A SUBTLE LITTLE LIGHT dances across his face.
We watch Owen in close-up for awhile as he stares upwards.
Then, we cut to a wide shot to see what he's staring up at:
There's a SMALL BLUE FLICKER DANCING IN THE AIR, six feet
above his sleeping bag.
Like a TV's glimmering blue calibration screen that has
somehow willed itself into this plane of existence.
Owen stares up into the light.
It's tiny, almost imperceptible. Perhaps just a trick of the
light, perhaps not.
Perhaps a dream, perhaps not.

76 INT. MOVIE THEATER PROJECTION BOOTH - NIGHT 76
SCRRRRRCHT --
The movie theater's 35mm film projector malfunctions.
The film is caught in the gatehead, causing the projector to
stall and spin out. Some of the FILM STOCK itself is spitting
up from the reel, unfurling wildly onto the ground.
Adult Owen (back in 2006 now) stands six feet away, watching
aghast and frozen as the machine malfunctions. His asshole
manager Dave stands behind him, also frozen in the face of
the crisis.
DAVE
Fix it!
Owen glances at his manager, who is clearly expecting Owen to
take charge here.
DAVE (CONT'D)
Fix it! What did you do?!

Owen moves to grab hold of the projector to try to stop it
from unspooling further. It's like trying to grab hold of a
bucking bronco.
He thinks twice, and instead UNPLUGS the machine, grabbing
its wiring out from the wall socket.
The projector slows to a stop, returning the room to quiet.
Dave shakes his head in annoyance and condescension, like all
this is Owen's fault.
Owen stands there, plug in hand, allowing his breathing to
return to normal.

79 INT. MOVIE THEATER LOBBY - LATER 79
Now Owen shovels popcorn into black garbage bags. Going
through the motions of his nightly routine.
TITLE ON SCREEN:

REVERSE ON:
The clear glass doors at the front of the movie theater.
THROUGH THE GLASS WE CAN SEE -
The vast, empty parking lot. A desert of concrete.
A few stray SHOPPING CARTS drift down a slight decline,
rolling slowly past the window like tumbleweed blowing in the
wind.
RISING THE SOUNDTRACK:
ANTISEPTIC SUPERMARKET MUZAK.
It carries us into:
80 INT. 24-HOUR SUPERMARKET - NIGHT 80
The snack aisle, lit by the impossibly blinding fluorescents
of a supermarket past midnight.

Owen lethargically pushes his shopping cart past a towering,
carefully arranged Nabisco display. He's half-asleep for this
late night shopping trip.
He inspects CRACKER BOXES on the shelf. They all look the
same.
The store's overhead speakers switch from muzak to a chipper
in-store ad for MICROWAVE POPCORN.
Owen looks up from the shelf and notices something strange at
the far-end of the aisle...
MADDY.
She stands there between the two shelves, about two dozen
feet away, pale in the supermarket glow.
She's wearing the same button-down we saw her in earlier when
she waited outside Owen's house.
MADDY
(firm)
I need to talk to you.
Owen looks around, like he's not sure if this woman is
talking to him. Her style and appearance has changed with the
years, so he doesn't immediately recognize her.
OWEN
Ma'am? Are you...
He steps in front of his shopping cart, nervous by the
intensity of this mystery woman at the end of the aisle.
OWEN (CONT'D)
Do you need help?
Maddy stares at him, concerned and serious.
MADDY
Do you remember me?
Owen squints. He takes a furtive step down the aisle, closer
towards her.
And then -- he realizes who it is.
His expression drops as the gravity of this moment hits him
all at once.
OWEN
...Maddy?

FROM FAR DOWN THE PERPENDICULAR MEAT AISLE WE WATCH --
Owen rush towards Maddy and hug her. From this far distance
his voice kind of blends with the electric hum of the store.
OWEN (CONT'D)
Jesus, Maddy. Where... where have
you been?
CLOSE ON MADDY --
She lets Owen hug her, but she doesn't hug back. The fear and
concern grows in her eyes...
81 EXT. SUPERMARKET PARKING LOT - NIGHT 81
Owen leads Maddy across another empty parking lot. He walks
slowly and glances back at her, as if he's scared that if he
doesn't keep an eye on her at all times she'll disappear for
another decade...
We're once again watching from far away, so the two of them
are little more than specks. They're dwarfed by a billboard
looming across the highway, advertising:
THE FUN CENTER. GRAND OPENING!
A state-of-the-art, Kid's Zone-style indoor entertainment
complex.
MADDY (V.O.)
I know a place on the edge of town.
82 OMITTED 82
83 EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - NIGHT 83
BLUE and RED lights from a cop car strobe silently out into

They're draped in fog, in the midst of a moody, sad, sexy
song.
LEAD SINGER

I Saw the TV glow // Reflected in
your eyes
We watch the band play for awhile, hearing a decent chunk of
their song.
LEAD SINGER (CONT'D)
I heard the static // Until my ears
were pierced.
And the chorus:
LEAD SINGER (CONT'D)
Night time // Night time // Day for
night // Night time // Night time
// Day for night.
Eventually, we CUT TO:
A corner booth. Where Owen and Maddy sit across from each
other, drinks in front of them.
ADULT OWEN
--I just-- I really think you need
to go to the police. They think
you're dead, Maddy.
Maddy shrugs, fully non-committal.
MADDY
I don't know. Sometime.
ADULT OWEN
And you won't tell me where you've
been for the past decade?
MADDY
I'll tell you everything. I just --
I need to ask you something first.
Owen is struggling here...

MADDY
I need to ask you something first.

Owen sighs, giving in.
ADULT OWEN
Okay.
He leans back in the booth.
ADULT OWEN (CONT'D)
What do you need to ask me?
Maddy glances around the club, then looks back at Owen.
MADDY
Do you remember a TV show we used
to watch together?
She leans in a bit, gradually closing the booth space between
them.
MADDY (CONT'D)
It was called... 'The Pink Opaque.'
Owen ruffles his brow. He pauses for a moment to process the
question.
Then --
He laughs nervously, like the question is absurd.
ADULT OWEN
Of course I remember The Pink
Opaque, Maddy. It's my favorite TV
show of all time.
He looks her in the eye, as if recalling a blood pact they
once took together:
ADULT OWEN (CONT'D)
Always will be.
Maddy stares at him, looking vaguely concerned.
Owen reminisces, a warmth entering his voice. This is his
favorite subject.
ADULT OWEN (CONT'D)
I've got the complete series on
DVD. They've got a ride dedicated
to it now at One Universe Studios.
I'm saving up to go out there...
He smiles, thinking about this plan of his.
A long silence. Owen's smile fades a bit with the dead air.

He looks confused.
ADULT OWEN (CONT'D)
That's all you wanted to ask me? If
I remembered The Pink Opaque?
MADDY
No, I...
Maddy leans in closer.
MADDY (CONT'D)
I guess what I mean is... When you
think back on watching The Pink
Opaque... how do you remember it?
A beat. Owen blinks a few times.
ADULT OWEN
How do I remember it?
MADDY
Yeah...
Maddy bites her lip.
MADDY (CONT'D)
Do you remember it as just a TV
show?
She stares at Owen, studying his face as he processes her
question.
The music in the club carries us briefly back...
85 INT. MADDY'S BASEMENT - NIGHT, 1998 85
...Into the past. Back into Maddy's basement, all those years
ago. The song we heard in the goth club moments ago is now
playing diegetically on the unseen TV screen.
Teenaged Maddy sits on a piano bench, facing a closed closet
door on the other end of the basement, waiting for:
TEEN OWEN (O.S.)
(from the closet)
Okay. Okay I think I got it.
Owen is rustling around from inside the closet. Maddy waits
for him on the other side of the door.

Teen Owen opens the closet door. But before we can get a look
at him, we return:
86 INT. DIVE BAR - NIGHT, 2006 86
To 2006. To Adult Owen and Maddy's conversation at the bar.
Owen looks slightly alarmed at Maddy's strange question.
ADULT OWEN
The Pink Opaque was a TV show...
He says it like he's trying to explain to a toddler that you
need oxygen to breathe.
He looks from side-to-side, then back at Maddy.
ADULT OWEN (CONT'D)
We watched it in your basement on
Saturday nights. From 10:30 to
11pm. Remember? The last show
before the young adult network
switched to black-and-white reruns
for the night.
Owen looks at Maddy like this is obvious. He's starting to
sweat a little bit.
MADDY
Yeah, but... Are you sure? Are you
sure that's all it was?

Maddy's basement. The past.
As Teen Owen steps out of the closet. We see Maddy's
expression before we see what she's looking at.
REVERSE ON:
OWEN, wearing the same prom dress we've seen Isabel from The
Pink Opaque wearing a few times.
He's embarrassed. He doesn't know what to do with his eyes,
so he just glances nervously around the room.
He finally works up the courage to look Maddy in the eye.
She stares back at him, meeting his gaze.
88 INT. DIVE BAR - NIGHT, 2006 88
Back in 2006. Owen is getting alarmed by Maddy's odd
questions. Perhaps even oddly defensive...
ADULT OWEN
Is this some sort of joke? Because
I--
MADDY
--No. It's not a joke. Listen: I
know this might sound crazy, but...
She leans in even closer. There are just inches between them
now.
MADDY (CONT'D)
When you think back on The Pink
Opaque. When you remember watching
it in my basement on Saturday
nights from 10:30 to 11pm... do you
ever get... confused? Like, maybe
the memory isn't quite right?
Owen's heart is beating fast in his chest now.
There's something in his expression that almost resembles
guilt. Like Maddy's verbalizing some secret he doesn't want
spoken out loud.

The band on stage have finished their song now. There’s only
silence surrounding Owen as he responds to Maddy’s escalating
interrogations:
ADULT OWEN
What do you mean, "not quite
right?"
MADDY
Like: does time ever seem like it's
not moving normally? Like it's all
out of whack?
Owen is taken aback, panicked.
ADULT OWEN
(stammering)
I... I, uh--
MADDY
Or do you ever have a hard time
distinguishing between what
happened in the show and what
happened in real life? Like somehow
the memories got jumbled around?
89 EXT. SUBURBAN STREETS - NIGHT, 1998 89
Teenage Owen and Maddy walk side-by-side down an abandoned
suburban street, gently stepping over chalk drawings left out
overnight on the pavement.
Owen's still wearing the prom dress. He's clearly equally
terrified and exhilarated to be outside in it, even under the
cover of darkness.
Maddy holds him by the hand, leading him down the street,
past sleeping houses, deeper into the night...
ADULT OWEN (V.O.)
...Jumbled around?
90 INT. DIVE BAR - NIGHT, 2006 90

ADULT OWEN
You're not alarming me. I just...
maybe we should talk to somebody

Maddy leans in closer towards him, her gaze intense.
Owen looks ghostly, as if he's terrified for what she's about
to say.

MADDY (CONT'D)
I've been there.
A beat. Owen stares back at Maddy, all the color drained from
his face.
MADDY (CONT'D)
Inside the show. Inside the Pink
Opaque...
CUT TO:
THE STAGE. Where the new band’s intense dirge is building
momentum. The LEAD SINGER screams at the top of their lungs
into the microphone as we DISSOLVE and DESCEND back in time
once again towards…
91 EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD - NIGHT, 1998 91
Maddy leading Owen by the hand onto the high school football
field.
They're lit by bright moonlight. Owen continues to walk
slowly and reluctantly, nervous in the prom dress.
Maddy looks at Owen, then up into the night sky. Up towards
the moon.
Owen looks up.
We hold on his expression.
MADDY
You see it too...
Maddy and Owen stand out there, alone on the football field,
draped under the moon's strange glow.
And then finally, we reverse up towards:
MR. MELANCHOLY.
THE MAN IN THE MOON.
Grinning silently down at them, huge and imposing in the
night sky.
MADDY (CONT'D)
...He's getting closer.
We push CLOSER and CLOSER in towards the moon.
Until he surrounds us. That sick, knowing grin...

He reaches his MOON ARMS out from the sides of the moon. And
then --
He PULLS HIMSELF OUT FROM THE MOON.
POUNCING. Craters crumble into the cosmos behind him as he
heads straight towards us.
ABRUPT CUT BACK TO:
92 EXT. DIVE BAR, BACK ALLEY - NIGHT, 2006 92
Adult Owen, as he comes bursting out through the backdoor of
the dive bar. Out into the parking lot.
He grabs his car keys from his pocket and rushes towards his
car.
Maddy exits the club too. She watches Owen as he unlocks his
car door and opens it up in a state of panic.
She calls out to him from across the parking lot.
MADDY
I can't stay in this place much
longer.
She sounds calm, confident and resigned.
MADDY (CONT'D)
I'm going back there.
Owen pauses by the car door. He doesn't get inside, but he
also doesn't turn back to face Maddy.
MADDY (CONT'D)
...Do you remember how it ended?
The final episode?
Owen closes his eyes and winces, as if he doesn't want to
remember.
Maddy continues to stare across the parking lot at his back,
and calls to him one more time.
MADDY (CONT'D)
I'll be at the high school tomorrow
night at midnight. I hope you'll
come.
Owen gets inside the car and closes the door behind him.

Maddy stands still, just watching as Owen puts his car into
reverse and then drives out of the parking lot.

94 INT. MADDY'S BATHROOM - MORNING, 1998 94
We're back in 1998. Back at Maddy's house, the morning after
their night out on the football field.
Owen is hunched over the sink in Maddy's bathroom,
He's shirtless, desperately trying to scrub the PINK SYMBOL
off the back of his neck.
He keeps scrubbing. It's almost entirely gone.
MADDY (V.O.)
It's time. We're ready.
95 OMITTED 95
96 INT. MADDY'S BASEMENT - MORNING, 1998 96
Owen zips up his sleeping bag into a ball. The nape of his
neck is raw from his attempts to wash off the symbol.
He speaks to Maddy - who's over on the staircase in her usual
spot - but doesn't look at her.
OWEN
...We?
MADDY
Pack as much as you can in your
overnight bag next Saturday. You
can't tell anyone we're leaving.
Not your mom. Not anyone.
Maddy is sitting on the staircase, in her usual spot. The
morning light casting shadows across her face.
Owen glances up from his work at her.
She looks resigned, deadly serious.
OWEN
Where will we go?

A long silence.
And then, finally, Maddy answers his question:
MADDY
We'll know where when we get there.
Owen turns back to his sleeping bag and continues his work on
the floor, a world of conflict playing out silently in his
expression.
CLOSE ON:
The prom dress he wore the night before, draped over the
couch.
97 EXT. SUBURBAN BACKYARDS - MORNING, 1998 97
Now Owen walks slowly across backyards, sleeping bag tucked
under his arms. Just like all those other Saturday mornings.
He looks like he's in a daze, a ghost sleepwalking in his own
skin.
Slowly, he PICKS UP THE PACE, walking faster and faster.
Until he's sprinting. RUNNING as fast as he can across the
endless sprawl of backyards.
As if he's trying to ESCAPE.
CUT TO:
98 EXT. JOHNNY LINK'S HOUSE - MORNING, 1998 98
Owen's outside another house now, RINGING THE DOORBELL
repeatedly.
He KNOCKS loudly on the front door.
He's in a state of panic.
JOHNNY LINK'S MOM, 45, opens the front door and looks down in
confusion at the pale kid on her front porch.
JOHNNY LINK'S MOM
...Owen?
A beat. Owen stares back at her, pale and panicked.
JOHNNY LINK'S MOM (CONT'D)
Johnny's not home, but--

TEEN OWEN
--You need to tell my dad. I've
been lying to him.
He's speaking quickly. The woman on the other side of the
door struggles to understand what is going on.
TEEN OWEN (CONT'D)
I've been pretending to sleep here
while my mom's in the hospital. I
need to be grounded.
JOHNNY LINK'S MOM
Slow down, honey. What--
TEEN OWEN
--Please. You have to tell my dad.
I've been sneaking out. I've been
planning to run away. I've been
bad.
Owen is speaking quickly, as if in the midst of a panic
attack. He hardly seems aware of his surroundings.
TEEN OWEN (CONT'D)
He'll be here soon, and you have to
tell him. Please. I need to be
grounded. You can't let me leave...
We stay close on Owen's face. On his desperate pleas for
help.
99 EXT. OWEN'S HOUSE - EARLY MORNING, 2006 99
And then we're back a decade later.
As Adult Owen pulls his car into the driveway, finally
arriving home from his night out with Maddy at the dive bar,
just as the sun is beginning to rise.
He turns the car off but doesn't get out.
He lingers in the driver's seat, his head hung down towards
the steering wheel, exhausted with the weight of it all.
100 INT. OWEN'S KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER 100
The empty room is bathed in pre-dawn light. We can hear the
faint sound of TELEVISION coming from the next room over.
INSERT SHOT:

An urn resting on a table near the hallway, alongside a
framed picture of Brenda. A modest shrine to the departed.
Adult Owen lets himself into the house through the backdoor,
still exhausted.
He listens to the sound of the nearby television drone, and
then walks slowly through the kitchen.
101 INT. OWEN'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 101
Frank, still looking sickly and weak with the advanced years,
rests under blankets on the couch.
He's not watching TV. Instead, his eyes are peeled on Owen
sneaking back into the house with the morning light.
Owen stops in the doorway, frozen under his father's gaze.
OWEN
Sorry, I... There was a problem
with the projector at the theater.
I had to stay late to fix it.
He sounds nervous and unsure of himself. He doesn't have
anywhere near the conviction needed to sell this lie.
Owen waits for his father to respond to him.
Frank doesn't say anything. He just stares, his gaze weak but
penetrating, full of anger and disgust.
We hold on Frank's gaze for several seconds -- that strange,
otherworldly stare penetrating through us.
Owen looks around the room, uncomfortable, eager to break the
silence..
OWEN (CONT'D)
Let me know if you need anything.
Okay. I'll be upstairs.
Owen turns and hurries up the staircase.
102 INT. OWEN'S HOUSE - NIGHT, 1996 102
We're briefly back in the 90s again, following behind Young
Owen as he walks up the stairs and across the second floor of
his house.
He heads down the hallway towards his bedroom.

103 INT. OWEN'S BEDROOM - MORNING, 2006 103
And just as quickly, we're back in 2006.
Adult Owen closes the door to his bedroom behind him. He
leans against the door and exhales deeply, letting out what
sounds like a decade of stress.
CUT TO:
Adult Owen crouching on the carpet in front of his opened
bedroom closet.
He empties the contents of his old PILLOW CASE out onto the
carpet. The one where he stored Maddy's homemade VHS tapes
all those years ago.
The tapes are still in there, grown dusty and faded with
time.
They fall from the pillowcase onto the carpet.
Owen sits in front of the collection of Pink Opaque tapes. He
studies their labels: all of the different episodes and hand￾written notes by Maddy.
He continues studying and surveying the collection.
And then, finally --
He looks up, directly at us.
At the camera.
ADULT OWEN
(narrating)
A little while after Maddy
disappeared, she called me one more
time. The night the last episode of
The Pink Opaque aired.
104 INT. OWEN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT, 1998 104
Owen - his teenaged self once again - is laying in bed,
trying and failing to sleep.
It's past his bedtime. 10:32, to be exact.
Owen stares at his bedside clock, feeling his weekly Saturday
night FOMO.
THE PHONE RINGS.

      69.
Owen's eyes go wide. He shoots up in bed.
He grabs the phone off the receiver in his bedroom, as if
acting on instinct. He manages to do it before even the
second ring.
He holds the phone up to his ear.
TEEN OWEN
(quiet)
...Hello?
MADDY (O.S.)
(on the phone)
I think they're going to meet
again.
Owen's eyes go wide.
TEEN OWEN
Maddy where are you? The police
came here looking for you. They--
MADDY (O.S.)
(on the phone)
Isabel and Tara. They're going to
meet again. In real life.
The line clicks off on the other end. Owen pauses a moment,
processing this.
KNOCK KNOCK.
Owen quickly hangs up the phone and shoots back down under
the covers.
It's Frank at the door, suspicious about the phone call. He
cracks the bedroom door open and peers inside.
TEEN OWEN
(acting asleep)
...Whaaat? Is it with binoculars?
A beat. Then:
Frank closes the door, satisfied at the incoherence of his
son's sleep mumblings.
Owen stares up at the ceiling, wide awake and full of
adrenaline.
He waits to hear his father walk down the hall and close his
bedroom door. Then:

105 EXT. OWEN'S BEDROOM - DAY, 2006 105
ADULT OWEN sits in front of the VHS collection.
He continues narrating to the camera.
ADULT OWEN
Isabel and Tara begin to notice
signs and portents...
106 INT. OWEN'S HOUSE, TOP FLOOR - NIGHT, 1998 106
Young Owen creeps across the top floor of his house, walking
like a jewel thief past his father's room, then down a
staircase.
He takes each step gently, afraid of each potential creak in
the floorboards.
ADULT OWEN (V.O.)
Frogs in the water fountain. Locust
at the post office.
107 INT. OWEN'S LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER, 1998 107
Shrouded in darkness, Teen Owen opens the basement door and
creeps down the stairs.
The clock on the stove nearby reads 10:36.
ADULT OWEN (V.O.)
Craters from the moon rain down
from the sky.
108 INT. OWEN'S BASEMENT - MOMENTS LATER, 1998 108
Owen kneels in front of the small CRT TV in his basement. He
flips on the TV and quickly turns the dial to turn the sound
down low.
He flips through channels manually on the TV itself, moving
as fast as he possibly can, desperate to get to the episode.
And then...

109 INT. ISABEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 109
We're inside it. Back in The Pink Opaque.
Isabel is sitting cross-legged on her bed. Her eyes closed.
The symbol on the back of her neck glowing a BRIGHT,
SUPERNATURAL PINK.
She speaks in her mind using her psychic powers, and we hear
her in voice-over:
ISABEL (V.O.)
Mr. Melancholy is coming.
Tara answers from somewhere else...
TARA (V.O.)
He's already here. If we don't do
something today--
110 INT. OWEN'S BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS, 1998 110
Owen walks backwards towards the couch, careful not to take
his eyes off the screen for even a second.
TARA (V.O.)
(from screen)
--this world will be his.
111 EXT. DOCK BY THE LAKE - DAY 111
Now we're at camp, by the lake.
Isabel and Tara sit on the dock, levitating and communicating
on "the psychic plane."
TARA
This psychic plane isn't enough
anymore. If we're going to defeat
him this time, we're going to need
to harness the full potential of
our shared powers. We're going to
need to meet again... in person.
112 INT. OWEN'S BEDROOM - DAY, 2006 112
We're back with Adult Owen in front of the VHS tapes. He
looks into the camera and continues to narrate the episode
for us:

Isabel protests, telling Tara: But
that's impossible. We live on
opposite ends of the county.

114 INT. OWEN'S BASEMENT - NIGHT, 1998 114
We hear Tara deliver her very dramatic next line from the
unseen television:
TARA
Start running.
Teen Owen's face: oh shit.
We hear the show's score crescendo on the unseen screen, and
then we hear a commercial for FROZEN PIZZA begin.
Now that the show is on break, Owen remembers where he is.
He glances anxiously around the room, from the screen up
towards his basement door.
No sign of his father... Yet.
115 EXT. OWEN'S BEDROOM - DAY, 2006 115
Back with our narrator, back in 2006:
ADULT OWEN
When the show returned from its act
break, Isabel had already arrived
back at sleepaway camp.
116 EXT. CAMP GROUNDS - DAY FOR NIGHT 116
Isabel walks across the sprawling Capture the Flag field at
her old sleepaway camp.
She's out of breath, as if she just ran all the way here.
She walks past empty bunks. She looks around, searching.
ISABEL
Tara? Tara?!
The door to her old bunk is hanging open. The door SLAMS over
and over again with the wind.

      73.
Isabel looks inside the bunk from the porch. It's empty.
It's a ghost camp. No one else around.
But then, faintly, in the distance, Isabel hears something...
TARA (O.S.)
Isabel?!
It's almost so quiet that it could be her imagination. Isabel
stands there outside the bunk, listening to the wind.
TARA (O.S.) (CONT'D)
Isabel?!
There it is again, a little louder this time.
It's Tara.
She's calling from the distance, searching for Isabel like
Isabel is searching for her.
117 INT. OWEN'S BASEMENT - NIGHT, 1998 117
Teen Owen moves slowly off the couch, once again careful not
to take his eyes off the screen.
He gently picks up a nearby TELEPHONE off the receiver. He
dials Star Sixty Nine.
He holds the phone up to his ear.
Before the first ring is over, Maddy answers.
She doesn't speak, but we can hear her breathing through the
line.
They watch the episode together in silence.
ADULT OWEN (V.O.)
Isabel follows the sound of Tara's
voice. She finds her at the dock by
the lake. The real lake. The place
where they first spoke five seasons
ago.
118 EXT. DOCK BY THE LAKE - DAY FOR NIGHT 118
Isabel approaches from the distance, hurrying, no time to
waste.

She can see TARA sitting on the dock in the distance, waiting
for her.
As Isabel rushes closer, Tara stands up to greet her friend.
119 INT. OWEN'S BEDROOM - DAY, 2006 119
Back with Adult Owen, our narrator:
ADULT OWEN
But then. As Isabel approaches, she
picks something up...
120 EXT. DOCK BY THE LAKE - DAY FOR NIGHT 120
Back to the show. Tara stands in the distance, smiling and
waiting for Isabel.
Isabel stops in her tracks, suddenly frozen.
ADULT OWEN (V.O.)
A stray signal from the psychic
plane.
TARA (V.O.)
(quiet, sick)
Help me...
121 INT. OWEN'S BASEMENT - NIGHT, 1998 121
Teen Owen watches from his space on the floor, the phone
still up to his ear. He's concerned. His breaths vaguely
asthmatic.
122 INT. OWEN'S BEDROOM - DAY, 2006 122
ADULT OWEN
It's a desperate message from Tara.
The real Tara. She's buried
underground, in terrible danger.

Tara lying buried underground, covered in dirt, coughing
violently.

Her pupils are dilated pure white, as if she's in the midst

She coughs again, spitting up a GNARLY BLUE LIQUID all over
her lips and chin.
CUT TO:
124 EXT. DOCK BY THE LAKE - DAY FOR NIGHT 124
Isabel stands there, frozen, terrified of this vision of Tara
she's just had.
ADULT OWEN (V.O.)
Mr. Melancholy had got to her
first.
125 INT. OWEN'S BASEMENT - NIGHT, 1998 125
Teen Owen breathes asthmatically into the phone, his eyes
wide. We can hear Maddy breathing back on the other end.
TEEN OWEN
(to himself, into phone)
It's a trap...
He lets the phone drift from his ear, lowering it down
towards the carpet as he continues to watch the unseen
screen.
126 EXT. DOCK BY THE LAKE - DAY FOR NIGHT 126
We push in closer towards Tara. She stands waiting for Isabel
on the dock.
But as we get closer, we realize:
It's not Tara. It's MR. MELANCHOLY, dressed up in Tara's
clothes.
We see his gnarled, grinning, powdered white face for just a
moment before we REVERSE BACK ON;
ISABEL, as she's grabbed by Mr. Melancholy's henchmen Marco
and Polo (those monsters with the crescent-moon heads who we
saw earlier).

127 INT. OWEN'S BASEMENT - NIGHT, 1998 127
We can hear Maddy's voice faintly from the phone receiver by
Owen's side.
MADDY (V.O.)
(from the phone)
What did they do to Tara?
But Owen's too invested in Isabel's struggles on screen to
respond.
128 EXT. CAMP GROUNDS - EARLY EVENING 128
Our MOON HENCHMEN are hard at work digging a hole in the
ground in the middle of a field.
ADULT OWEN (V.O.)
They dig a hole in the ground. They
cut out her heart.
129 INT. CAMP DINING HALL - EARLY EVENING 129
Now the Moon Men carry a STILL BEATING HEART across the
dining hall.
One holds open a LARGE STORAGE FREEZER. They place the heart
inside next to one already in there, also still beating.
ACROSS THE ROOM:
Isabel is incapacitated now, tied with rope to a chair near
the dining hall serving area, and barely conscious. There’s a
bunch of blood on her shirt in the area where her heart was
just removed.
Marco and Polo are forcing a straw between her lips.

ADULT OWEN (V.O.)
They feed her the Luna Juice.
They coax the confused Isabel to take a sip of juice from
their oversized LUNA JUICE JUICEBOX.
She struggles a little bit, confused, but lets the BLUE GOO
travel from the straw into her mouth; lets it dribble down
her chin.
She struggles to return to consciousness, the world a haze
around her as:
Mr. Melancholy emerges from the shadows of the dining hall
like a mob boss waiting in the wings for his henchmen to
complete their work.
Then - he kneels calmly in front of his incapacitated
prisoner.
MR. MELANCHOLY
Don't fight it. Let my poison work
its magic. You're going to love the
Midnight Realm - it's a wonderful
prison.
Isabel continues struggling, but a little less hard. We can
tell that she's fading.
MR. MELANCHOLY (CONT'D)
Shh. It's okay. Soon you won't
remember anything. You won't even
remember... that you're dying.
He grins big. He can't help but giggle.
Isabel has just a little bit of struggle left in her. She
writhes and fights against the Moon Men's grasp. And then:
Her body goes limp.
130 EXT. CAMP GROUNDS - NIGHT 130
The Moon Men shovel dirt, filling in the fresh grave they've
just dug.
ADULT OWEN (V.O.)
They bury her alive.
CUT TO:
Isabel's body TUMBLING over dirt, down into the Earth.

NOTE: the sound of her body falling mirrors exactly the first
sound we heard in the film.
CUT TO:
A wide shot, peering down into the open grave.
WE ZOOM SLOWLY IN TOWARDS:
ISABEL.
Her eyes are wide open and blank, dilated pure white and
frozen in terror like Tara's were earlier.
Her mouth, cheeks, and chin are CAKED WITH DRY BLUE VOMIT.
She's lying stiff, staring straight up into the night sky as
dirt is shoveled over her body.
She's vacant, as if her mind is somewhere else, somewhere far
from this body currently being buried alive.
ADULT OWEN (V.O.)
And then...
We keep pushing down closer and closer towards Isabel. Until
suddenly...
WE CUT TO BLACK.
131 INT. OWEN'S BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS, 1998 131
We're back in the basement with Owen, staring with him at the
BLACK TV SCREEN.
An end credit appears on the screen:
EXECUTIVE PRODUCER
Josh Pemberton
Owen struggles to breath, traumatized by this ending, as we
hold on the TV screen.
132 INT. OWEN'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT, 1998 132
Upstairs now.
The clock above the oven reads 11:01.
All is still and quiet in the house after dark. Until
suddenly, we hear:

      79.
THE SOUND OF GLASS SHATTERING. It's loud and abrupt, and over
as quickly as it started.
Then -- the sound of a bedroom door opening upstairs, and
someone running down the unseen stairs.
FRANK rushes through the living room. He throws open the door
to the basement and quickly descends the stairs.
CUT TO:
133 INT. OWEN'S BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS 133
Owen's head is literally INSIDE THE TELEVISION, his body
hanging out from it, propped up on the carpet.
Smoke rises from the broken set.
It appears Owen has smashed the screen with his head. He's
now unconscious inside the screen.
Frank rushes down the staircase. He works to pull his son out
from inside the TV screen.
At first Owen's body is limp and unmoving.
Then, as his father pulls him out, Owen shows signs of life
again. And instinctively, he begins to struggle.
He flails his arms around. He tries to hold himself inside
the TV screen, clutching for the edges of the set.
But Frank is bigger than Owen, and is easily able to pull his
son out from inside.
Owen's head emerges from inside, and once again he GASPS and
WHEEZES loudly, as if in the midst of both an asthma and
panic attack. It's like some sick parody of a home birth.
ON THE SOUNDTRACK: The sound of a SHOWER turning on.
134 INT. OWEN'S BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER, 1998 134
Frank runs the water as hot as he can.
He holds his son's body over the steam, forcefully
positioning Owen to breath it in.
Owen is still GASPING AND STRUGGLING AND WHEEZING VIOLENTLY.
His breathes are basically CRIES OF ANGUISH. He's lost all
control of his body.

Frank's eyes are stern and resolved. He tries to hold his son
up, tries to get him to breathe again.
Owen struggles against his father’s grip, trying to break
free.
He continues to CRY AND GASP.
He barely has a voice, but he tries to scream:
TEEN OWEN
THIS ISN'T MY HOME! THIS ISN'T MY
HOME!
His eyes dart around the room, red and wet and terrified.
IN THE DISTANCE -- the sound of an ambulance approaching.
Frank holds his son in place, trying to get him to breathe.
Owen keeps thrashing and wheezing and crying.
TEEN OWEN (CONT'D)
YOU'RE NOT MY FATHER!
Frank just holds his son firm.
Owen GASPS and HEAVES, as if he's about to throw up.
And then:
He PROJECTILE VOMITS.
But what comes out doesn't look like vomit.
It looks like soil.
Spewed out across the shower floor.
Dirt - brown and thick and wet, as if it was just dug up
fresh from the ground and somehow inserted into the pit of
Owen's stomach.
We only get a brief glimpse of the soil as it escapes from
Owen's lips. Then we abruptly:
CUT TO BLACK.
And we hold on the silence and darkness for awhile.

Adult Owen stares at his reflection in his bedroom mirror.
We're back in 2006. Maddy's old VHS tapes are still scattered
across the carpet of Owen's room.
Owen throws on a t-shirt. He looks at himself with
uncertainty and then --
He climbs out of his open bedroom window.
136 EXT. OWEN'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 136
We watch from across the street as Owen tries to gently
descend from the second story of his house, dropping down
into the grass.
The pavement of the road ahead is lined with those familiar
PINK AND PURPLE CHALK DRAWINGS.
MADDY (V.O.)
I started using a new name.
Sleeping at the cheapest hostel I
could find.
137 INT. OWEN'S CAR - NIGHT 137
Owen drives slowly down quiet streets in his town. He looks
unsure of himself, like a big part of him wants to just turn
back around.
He glances in his rearview mirror and notices --

A CREEPY MAN, 50, standing in his front yard at a workbench,
eyes on Owen's car as it passes.
138 EXT. HIGH SCHOOL PARKING LOT - NIGHT 138
Owen is the only one parked in the lot here at midnight at
his old high school.
He sits in the silent darkness of the front seat, as if
trying to run the clock out on this night. He doesn't want to
face what he's about to face.
But he knows he has to.
He opens the door and steps out into the parking lot.
He walks slowly towards the high school.
MADDY (V.O.)
"The Pink Opaque" was over.
139 EXT. SCHOOL BACK ENTRANCE - NIGHT 139
Owen walks a dark pathway around the perimeter of the school.
MADDY (V.O.)
I got a job at the mall. At "Build￾A-Bear," filling the dolls up with
stuffing.
He's looking for Maddy, but she's nowhere to be found.
Something catches his eye:
A DOOR propped open, leading into the school.
The glass of the door has been BROKEN, shards across the
grass and pavement.
Owen steps carefully over the glass, and then lets himself
into the school.
MADDY (V.O.)
I had got out of that town. That
place I knew would kill me if I
stayed. But there was something
still wrong. Wronger, even.
ON THE SOUNDTRACK:
The WHEEZE of MECHANICAL BREATHING, like oxygen being pumped.

It's coming from far away.
MADDY (V.O.)
Time wasn't right. It was moving
too fast. And then I was 19. And
then I was 20.
140 INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 140
Owen walks slowly down the dark hallway.
MADDY (V.O.)
I felt like on of those dolls.
Asleep in the supermarket. Stuffed.
And then I was 21. Like chapters
skipped over on a DVD.
He's headed towards that OXYGEN SOUND. It's rhythmic and
powerful, like the sound of a giant respirator.
It's coming from down the hall. From the gym...
MADDY (V.O.)
I said to myself, "This isn't
normal." "This isn't normal." "This
isn't how life is supposed to
feel."
141 INT. HIGH SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - MOMENTS LATER 141
Owen enters the doorway to the gymnasium and stares out at:
AN INFLATABLE PLANETARIUM.
It's a huge plastic dome taking up the entire basketball
court, towering high over the bleachers.
It's plugged into the wall, slowly rising towards the
ceiling. That respirator sound we've been hearing has been
the oxygen machine powering its inflation.
Owen stares ahead.
There's a little light up pixel tunnel connected to the dome
that one has to crawl through to get inside.
MADDY (V.O.)
I thought about running away again.
About moving to Sante Fe and
changing my name one more time. (MORE)

But I knew that everywhere would be

ended.
We descend into the darkness of the tunnel...
MADDY (V.O.)
I knew where I was.
142 INT. INFLATABLE PLANETARIUM TUNNEL - NIGHT 142
Now Owen crawls through the tunnel. It's been designed for
kids half his size, so he has to struggle to make it through.
PIXELS flash as Owen crawls.
MADDY (V.O.)
A little bit after my 22nd
birthday, I paid this burnout kid
who would always hit on me in the
food court fifty dollars to bury me
alive.
AHEAD, near the end of the tunnel, Owen can see the
shimmering glow of the artificial NIGHT SKY.
MADDY (V.O.)
I mean, he didn't know he was
burying me alive, but I doubt he
would've cared too much even if he
did.
He continues to crawl through this portal, clawing
desperately forward until he spots:
Maddy, waiting for him in the distance, looking melancholy
and lonely.
143 INT. INFLATABLE PLANETARIUM - CONTINUOUS 143
Later now. We’ve caught up to Maddy’s monologue we’ve been
listening to in voiceover.
It's romantic in here, like a pillow fort or the inside of a
snow castle you built as a kid after a blizzard.
FAKE STARS shimmer across the inner walls of the planetarium.
The FAKE NIGHT SKY glows with a dark blue warmth.
Maddy stands in front of the electric-powered night sky. This
is her campfire.
She stares ahead, past the camera, continuing her story:

MADDY
I dug a hole. I bought a coffin. I
got inside and I closed the lid.
Her monologue continues as she paces through the space,
telling Owen her scary story.
MADDY (CONT'D)
I told myself: this is crazy. What
you're doing is crazy. But another
part of me knew that it wasn't.
That it was survival. And that I
didn't have much time. That what
felt like years in this world was
actually just seconds.
MADDY (CONT'D)
And so I waited. And then,
finally... the first spadeful of
dirt hit the top of the box. And
then another. And then another.
MADDY (CONT'D)
I sang songs to myself. I counted
to ten thousand without skipping
any numbers. I pissed and I shit my
pants, and I forced my mouth to
produce whatever saliva I could
muster just so I'd have something
to drink.
MADDY (CONT'D)
I screamed as loud as I could for
help, and I apologized for the
whole thing. I begged God for
someone to come along and save me.
I tried and tried to claw my way
out. But that burnout guy from the
mall had packed the dirt in too
tight. Just like I'd asked him to
do.
MADDY (CONT'D)
And then, after I don't know how
long, I felt myself... start to
leave myself. It was like I was
watching myself on a TV all the way
across the room. And I was moving
further and further away from the
screen, until the screen was so
small that I couldn't even see
myself anymore.
We reverse back on:

OWEN, sitting there on the ground in the inflatable
planetarium, transfixed by Maddy's story, watching her with
the same fascination he used to watch The Pink Opaque with.
MADDY (CONT'D)
And then I was clawing my way up
out of the ground. And then I was
at the surface, gasping for air,
rain pouring down on me. Thunder
and lightning. And I was finally
back there... Back at sleepaway
camp.
ON OWEN ONCE AGAIN -- he furrows his brow. He doesn't move.
MADDY (CONT'D)
And just like I was waking up from
a bad dream -- that whole life,
that whole reality where I was
"Maddy Wilson," it drifted away. A
brief hallucination that after a
few moments I could hardly even
remember. All those memories that
felt so real at the time, washed
away with the rain back at our old
sleepaway camp. And I was me. I was
finally me again. And it was the
season six premiere.
She sets the flashlight gently down on the ground and
crouches. She continues speaking to Owen.
MADDY (CONT'D)
I tried searching for you, but Mr.
Melancholy had covered his tracks
too well. I knew you were buried
somewhere close by, but I didn't
know where. And your signal -- that
signal I used to be able to close
my eyes and feel so vividly -- it
was nowhere. I wasn't picking up
anything from the psychic plane.
ON OWEN:
He's starting to look frightened as the true weight of what
Maddy is telling him is beginning to sink in.
MADDY (CONT'D)
I found my heart...
Maddy continues, nearing the end of her story now.

She trails off briefly, her voice breaking with the trauma of
it all.
MADDY (CONT'D)
I left our hearts there because I
knew I wasn't done. And I found Mr.
Melancholy's cauldron. I found the
Luna Juice he used to send us to
the Midnight Realm, and I drank a
big sip straight out from the
ladle. And I lay back down on the
ground and I waited to fall back
asleep.
Owen looks stunned, his eyes nearly popping from his sockets.
MADDY (CONT'D)
I knew I needed to come back to
this place. I knew I needed to come
back and save you.
ADULT OWEN
Maddy...
Maddy stares back at him. Her voice is resolved, a little
angry even.
MADDY
That's not my name.
Owen stares at her, quiet once again.
MADDY (CONT'D)
And I haven't told you anything
tonight that you don't already
know.
Maddy stares resolutely at him.
MADDY (CONT'D)
Tell me. Tell me you know it's

This...
He shakes his head.
ADULT OWEN (CONT'D)
This is insane.
He struggles with his memories:
ADULT OWEN (CONT'D)
I remember -- I remember playing in
the snow. Driving to baseball games
with my dad. Cooking with my mom.
MADDY
Those memories were put there to
distract you. To keep you trapped.
Owen winces, squeezing his eyes shut, trying to search his
brain to figure out if this is true.
ADULT OWEN
This isn't the Midnight Realm,
Maddy. It's just the suburbs.
He says it like he's trying to convince himself it's true.
Maddy just glares ahead at him, resolved.
MADDY
I told you. That's not my name.
Her voice is firm, urgent.
MADDY (CONT'D)
And we need to go back down into
the soil. Tonight.
ON OWEN - pale and terrified. But we can see in his eyes that
Maddy's words have cut into him. He can't unhear them.

You don't have much time.

144 INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - LATER 144
Maddy leads Owen slowly down the school hallway, back in the
direction they came.
MADDY (V.O.)
I've got everything ready.
Owen's walking slowly. He's sweating. Terrified, almost out
of his body.
MADDY (V.O.)
That spot behind the football
field. Where the stoners used to
get high after school.
As Owen walks past his old lunch room, he fleetingly glances
through the doors into the empty cafeteria.
He sees the tables, all broken down for the night once again,
turned upside down like turtles stuck on their shells.
The lunch room passes by his periphery as he keeps walking.
He continues to follow behind Maddy.
MADDY (V.O.)
No one will find us there.
145 EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD - NIGHT 145
Now Owen and Maddy walk side-by-side across the football
field, headed towards the goal post out in the distance.
Owen is walking really slowly, like a man headed to the
gallows.
He's sweating, ghost white, breathing heavily. Each new yard
line on the football field brings him closer to his destiny.
Maddy glances back at him.
MADDY
Come on.
She looks at him, and notices his terror.
MADDY (CONT'D)
I know it's scary. That's part of
it.
She keeps walking.

Maddy looks back at him once again, happy he's finally called
her by her real name.
OWEN
(softly, mumbling)
The Drain Lord. Like the Drain
Lords...
Maddy stares at Owen for a few silent seconds, the two of
them alone out here in the middle of the football field.
Then -- Owen continues to mumble to himself, like a flurry of
ideas are turning over in his head.
OWEN (CONT'D)
It's not real if I don't think
about it. It's not real if I don't
think about it.
MADDY
Isabel...
Alarm registers on Maddy's face for just a moment before --
Owen ATTACKS.
Very suddenly POUNCING and PUSHING Maddy over onto the grass.
She lands with a thud, and Owen loses his balance too,
landing just next to her.
He's quick up to his feet. He pushes against the dirt and
grass of the field, struggling to stand.
He kicks up mud and RUNS FOR HIS LIFE.
He sprints across the football field, running as fast as he
can, trying desperately to get away from Maddy.
Maddy stands back up, but doesn't chase after Owen.
She just watches him run away.
146 EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER 146
Owen tears through the parking lot. He digs his car keys out
of his pockets, hands shaking.
He frantically unlocks his car door and jumps inside.

He SLAMS the door shut --

And struggles to fit the car keys into the ignition. His
hands are still shaking, as if they have a life of their own.
He finally manages it. He turns the keys to start the engine
and quickly shifts into DRIVE.
But before he peels away, he can't help it --
He glances up through the windshield, out into the distant
night...
Back towards THE FOOTBALL FIELD.
Maddy is waiting for him there at the near end of the field.
Just under the goalpost.
She's not chasing after him or calling out to him or anything
dramatic. She's just staring out at him, watching with
unsurprised disappointment as:
Owen speeds out of the parking lot, high-tailing it out of
there.
148 OMITTED 148
149 EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - NIGHT 149
Owen drives through his town at night, trying to calm down
Even though it's the middle of the night, the owners of each
house on this street are STANDING OUT ON THEIR FRONT LAWNS, staring blankly at Owen's car as he drives by.
ADULT OWEN (V.O.)
I locked myself inside. I didn't
leave the house for days.

He leans against the door, still breathing heavy. He closes
his eyes, relieved to be back home.
He looks towards the couch, expecting to see his father there
waiting for him like always in the living room.
But he's gone. There's no one there - just a pile of
blankets.
152 INT. OWEN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 152
Maddy’s VHS TAPES are still spread out on the carpet floor of
Owen's bedroom.
Owen stands by the window, looking out into the streetlit
suburban night. He clutches a pillow close to his chest for
comfort.
ADULT OWEN (V.O.)
I kept waiting for her to show back
up.
It's like he's barricaded himself in there as he waits for
his final showdown with Maddy to begin.
As he waits, he turns and narrates to the camera, as if
finishing the thought we've just heard him express in voice￾over:
ADULT OWEN
...But she never did. I never saw
her again.
153 EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD - MORNING 153
The sun rises on the empty football field. It's returned to
calm. No sign of anyone nearby.
AND DOWN BELOW --
In that dark, weed-infested field below the football field,
QUIET as well.
There's a HOLE dug deep into the ground, and a pile of dirt
nearby. But it hasn't been filled back in.
A grave, open indefinitely.

After a few days, I returned to

154 EXT. MOVIE THEATER PARKING LOT - DAY 154
The wide open sprawl of the movie theater parking lot.
Shopping carts idling between cars.
We're watching from near the highway. All the way across the
lot we can see a GAGGLE OF SENIOR CITIZENS queued up at the
box office to buy tickets.
ADULT OWEN (V.O.)
I kept waiting for her to show up
and surprise me one night while I
was cleaning the theater. To kidnap
me and take me back to the football
field. To force me underground.
155 INT. MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT 155
Owen sweeps up after a screening in the movie theater,
tossing out soda cups into a trash bag and picking up empty
candy boxes from the floor.
He glances behind him into the empty theater, almost
expecting to see Maddy waiting for him in a seat.
But it's just him in here. The theater is empty.
ADULT OWEN (V.O.)
I told myself she was an escaped
mental patient. That the whole
thing had been some deranged
fantasy she'd constructed. That I
had just nearly escaped the most
gruesome fate imaginable.
Owen continues to lifelessly sweep and clean, silhouetted
against the blank movie theater screen.
He turns to the camera and narrates:
ADULT OWEN
Other times I told myself she had
never even been real. That Maddy
Wilson never actually existed. That
she was just some imaginary friend
I'd made up a long time ago.

The pavement on each has been tagged with those familiar pink
and purple CHALK SCRIBBLINGS.
But there’s something different about the final drawing we
see. Below those familiar intersecting scribbles someone has
scrawled some text as well.
There in the pavement, big and bold, scrawled in messy
handwritten pink:
THERE IS STILL TIME
Left there like a reminder for the viewer.
And out in the distance:
MADDY, her back to us, chalk in hand, inconspicuous in a
hoodie, walking away from this place.
ADULT OWEN (V.O.)
The movie theater closed the next
Fall. I got a job at the Fun Center
across town.
157 EXT. OWEN'S HOUSE - DAY 157
Owen lugs an OLD, BULKY CRT TV out to the curb, leaving it
for the garbagemen.
ADULT OWEN (V.O.)
My father passed away in 2010 after
his second stroke.
WE DISSOLVE TO:
A time-lapse of the same shot. It's now ANOTHER DAY, further
into the future.
Two DELIVERY MEN carry a big box up to the doorstep.
A FRESH NEW FLATSCREEN TV.
ADULT OWEN (V.O.)
I decided to stay in the house. The
idea of living somewhere else just
didn't seem worth it. I'm a real
adult now. A homeowner.
Owen opens the front door. He drags his new television
inside, but pauses to narrate directly to camera before doing
so:

He closes the door behind him, leaving us alone out here in
the quiet, peaceful suburban morning.
After awhile, we DISSOLVE TO:
158 EXT. FIRE PIT - NIGHT 158
Owen, still alone at the fire pit we saw him set up all the
way at the beginning of the film.
The flames are dying down now, but still Owen sits here in
silent reflection, as if the whole film has been a memory
playing inside his head.
He exhales softly, then digs inside his backpack for a JUG OF
WATER. He pours it out over the fire, immediately
extinguishing the only light left in the forest.
159 EXT. WOODS - NIGHT 159
Owen stomps through the pitch black woods, headed back in the
same direction he came from.
After awhile, he turns his gaze from the path ahead and LOOKS
DIRECTLY INTO THE CAMERA, becoming our narrator one more
time:
ADULT OWEN
Anyway, like I was saying: the
other night it was raining and I
couldn't sleep, so I started The
Pink Opaque again.
CUT TO:
160 INT. OWEN'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 160
Owen is laying on his couch, searching on a streaming
platform on his fancy new 60-inch HD TV.
ADULT OWEN (V.O.)
It's available to stream now. You
don't even need a disc.
Owen scrolls through the episode listings on a streaming
platform interface. Eventually, he chooses episode 204:

"The Curse of Mr. Swirly."
A brief loading icon appears on the flat screen.
And the episode begins.
REVERSE ON:
Owen, lying on the living room couch, looking a lot like his
father used to look splayed out there, staring blankly ahead
at some old TV show.
He looks terrible. White as a ghost, gaunt, weak.
Near death, honestly.
He's gently wheezing with each breath as he stares ahead at
the screen.
ADULT OWEN (V.O.)
I started the Pink Opaque again,
and it was nothing like I
remembered it.
REVERSE ON:
The TELEVISION SCREEN.
NOTE: This is the first time we've actually seen The Pink
Opaque playing on a screen (rather than cutting into it in
full-screen).
IN THE SHOW, a group of KIDS run down a suburban street being
chased by SOMEONE.
ADULT OWEN (V.O.)
The whole thing felt cheesy. And
cheap. Dated, and not scary at all.
The scene on television cuts to:
ISABEL - but NOT OUR ISABEL (another actress, who looks
similar) shouting at MR. SWIRLY in his evil, plastic ice
cream helmet.
FAKE ISABEL
(on television)
Hey - Mr. Ice Cream Man!
The scene is shot from an awkward mid-length. Suddenly, The
Pink Opaque feels less like cinema and more like a shitty 90s
TV show.

this version of the show.
MR. SWIRLY
But I'm so lonely. I have nothing
to do all winter.
Back to Fake Isabel. She thinks for a few seconds, and then
with the DING of an unseen lightbulb, she gets an IDEA.
FAKE ISABEL
I know... In the wintertime, don't
sell ice cream... just sell soup
instead!
She raises her hands into frame and shows Mr. Swirly a fresh,
hot CUP OF CHOWDER.
REVERSE BACK ON:
Owen, on the couch, watching this garbage.
MR. SWIRLY (O.S.)
(from the television,
suddenly happy)
Why didn't I think of that?
Owen is barely conscious.
FAKE ISABEL (O.S.)
(from the television)
Let's all have a soup party!
GROUP OF KIDS (O.S.)
Yaaay! Soup party!!
OWEN (V.O.)
I just felt embarrassed.
Owen takes each breath like it's his last. A slow death
rattle.
RISING ON THE SOUNDTRACK --

A giant, windowless cavern of arcade games and flashing
lights. A cacophony of antiseptic neon - an epileptic's
nightmare, like if the ninth circle of hell was a Dave and
Buster's.
We cut between shots of gameplay at the chic arcade.
We see:
-KIDS in birthday hats, all playing SKEEBALL, one after
another, straight down in a line.
When someone gets a ball in a hole, bells RING from the
skeeball machine, and it lights up with FLASHING NEON.
-NEON LIGHTS inside another machine whip around in a circle
from one bulb to the next. A KID slams his fist down on a BIG
RED BUTTON, trying to stop the speeding light in just the
right spot to win a prize.
-A KID playing a horror-themed PINBALL MACHINE. The machine
clinking and clanking and dinging wildly...
CLOSE ON: The animation screen at the head of the pinball
machine. It's old school -- just monochrome yellow graphics
against a black background.
ON THE SCREEN -
A lo-fi rendering of Mr. Melancholy, laughing. His image
toggles from left to right as if he's just been hit by a
pinball.
PINBALL MR. MELANCHOLY
(from the machine)
Ha. Ha. Ha. You got me. Ha. Ha. Ha.
You got me.
Mr. Melancholy's mechanical laugh transitions us into our
next shot:
A CLOSE-UP on Owen's face, pale and sickly. He looks
exhausted and frightened.
We're across the floor of the arcade, with Owen now as he
loads up a TOKEN MACHINE with TOKENS.
He's still wheezing as he works, just like back on his couch.
It's like his whole life these days is one long, slowly
encroaching asthma attack.
But still he works through it. He's got a "Fun Center" vest
on, along with a nametag.

He uses a box cutter to open up a carboard box of token
rolls, then, with his HANDS SHAKING all the while, he rips
one roll of tokens open to load into the machine.
But before he can successfully load the tokens in --
He WHEEZES HARSHLY and accidentally drops the opened roll of
token across the carpeted arcade floor.
From behind his back:
CHILDREN'S LAUGHTER.
A group of pre-teen kids are eavesdropping and making fun of
him.
Owen weakly grabs for his ASTHMA INHALER in his vest pocket.
He shakes it, then attempts to take a PUFF. But it doesn't
work:
The inhaler is JAMMED, no longer working.
He shakes it again and tries once more. But it's futile. The
asthma inhaler is long broken, now. A stop-gap solution that
no longer works...
TITLE ON SCREEN:
2016
ON THE SOUNDTRACK: hysterical, rapturous laughter:
162 INT. THE FUN CENTER - DAY 162
A little later. Now the BIRTHDAY BOY (who we know is the
Birthday Boy because he’s wearing a big hat that says
“Birthday Boy” on it) laughs hysterically from inside:
A BIG, CLEAR BOX. Like a see-through plastic coffin propped
up vertically into the air.
He gasps and screams and laughs as he grabs at COLORED PAPER
MONEY blowing around wildly in a windstorm inside the box.
It's a game: grab what you can before the wind slows down.
The Birthday Boy continues to grab and flail wildly, his
cheeks flapping in the wind as he tries to clutch the colored
bills whipping by.

His FAMILY and FRIENDS cheer him on as neon lights blink all
around. Everyone's laughing and screaming, on a collective
sugar high.
REVERSE ON:
Owen, watching from the other side of the room, still
wheezing, but trying to hold himself together. He looks like
a living corpse -- gaunt and old, yet somehow still young at
the same time.
163 INT. THE FUN CENTER - DAY 163
Now Owen stumbles with the crowd near the back of a line of
FUN CENTER EMPLOYEES.
The MAN at the head of the line is carrying a BIRTHDAY CAKE,
candles already lit and burning.
We track behind Owen as he follows his co-workers, zig￾zagging past the web of games and machines on the arcade
floor.
The Fun Center team burst through a door, entering into a new
room:
164 EXT. THE FUN CENTER, BIRTHDAY ROOM - CONTINUOUS 164
Where a PIZZA PARTY is underway, crust drying out on paper
plates while KIDS laugh in their seats and PARENTS gossip in
the corner.
FUN CENTER EMPLOYEES
(singing)
Happy birthday to you. Happy
birthday to you.
Owen is singing with them, but he looks like he's not even
sure where he is, like this whole thing is a dream he's
sleepwalking through.
The employee with the cake sets it down in front of the
Birthday Boy.
FUN CENTER EMPLOYEES (CONT'D)
(singing)
Happy birthday, dear Charlie.
Owen stops singing in the middle of this line, as if he's
just had a flash of deja vu.

FUN CENTER EMPLOYEES (CONT'D)
(singing)
Happy birthday to you.
Everyone laughs and claps as the song ends. Then --
ADULT OWEN
AGGGGHH!!!
Everyone in the room is immediately silent as Owen lets out a
blood-curdling SCREAM.
They all look at him. He's standing in the corner, looking
confused and terrified.
ADULT OWEN (CONT'D)
You need to help me! You need to
help me!! I"M DYING!! I'M DYING
RIGHT NOW!!
He gasps and wheezes and looks around the room at the faces
staring at him.
They're all smiling vacantly and staring blankly ahead, like
robots powered down.
Owen blinks a few times, then feels embarrassed for his
outburst.
ADULT OWEN (CONT'D)
I'm sorry. I'm fine. I don't know
what came over me.
He looks at the blank faces for approval.
After a few seconds, life slowly returns to the room. The
kids all look at each other and continue to joke around like
nothing happened. The parents start gossiping again over by
the pizza boxes.
Owen looks around the room, his face still ghost white and
damp with sweat.
Suddenly, his co-workers start CLAPPING and SINGING in
unison:
FUN CENTER EMPLOYEES
(singing)
For he's a jolly good fellow // For
he's a jolly good fellow...
Owen doesn't sing with them. He stands frozen in front of
some doilies, that look of PANIC returning to his face...

FUN CENTER EMPLOYEES (CONT'D)
For he's a jolly good fellow, which
nobody--
ADULT OWEN
TARA!!! TARA I'M SORRY!!
Everyone freezes and quiets down again. All eyes are on Owen
as he has another very loud and very public breakdown:
ADULT OWEN (CONT'D)
YOU NEED TO SAVE ME. PLEASE COME
SAVE ME!!
And once again, Owen tries to control himself, looking around
the room at everyone staring, feeling a sudden burst of
shame.
ADULT OWEN (CONT'D)
I'm sorry. Ignore me. I--
He KEELS OVER and HEAVES VIOLENTLY.
ADULT OWEN (CONT'D)
MOMMY?!! MOMMY?!!!
CUT TO:
165 INT. THE FUN CENTER - DAY 165
One of Owen's COLLEAGUES knocks on the bathroom door, then
calls inside.
FUN CENTER MANAGER
You okay in there, buddy?
166 INT. THE FUN CENTER, BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS 166
The sink is filled with little clumps of DIRT, and some BLUE
GEL that looks like dishwasher fluid..
Owen stands in front of the bathroom mirror.
His shirt is off, and discarded on the linoleum floor nearby.
His back is to us. He's blocking the mirror from view.
ADULT OWEN
(calling to his manager)
I'm fine. Out in a minute...
We slowly pan around Owen's bare back and torso.

Until:
His reflection in the mirror slowly enters frame...
He stares at the skin of his chest. And he slowly lifts
something up towards his ribcage...
The BOX CUTTER we saw him using earlier.
Hand-shaking and desperate, he begins to slowly CUT INTO
HIMSELF, tracing as straight a line as he can manage down the
middle of his torso.
He stares at his reflection, in no apparent pain.
There is no blood, no grotesque innards spilling out. Just a
clean, fresh slit down his body.
CUT TO:
MOMENTS LATER.
Owen has now dropped the box cutter to the ground, and is
staring at the FRESH SLIT he’s carved all the way down his
torso, from his rib cage down to just under his belly button.
Slowly, Owen uses his hands to...
PEEL OPEN THE SLIT.
And something shines at us from inside:
A GLOWING LIGHT -- flickering blue, like the calibration
screen on a television.
We don't quite see it, but we see Owen stare into the mirror,
at the shimmering blue light glowing from inside his chest.
He stares at himself, terrified by what he's uncovered
inside.
CUT TO:
MOMENTS LATER.
Owen is still in the bathroom, but now he's working to clean
himself up. He runs the sink, washing away all evidence of
the dirt and blue poison he just coughed up.
He crouches over the ground, throwing his uniform back on
over his bare back. The fabric shimmies down his spine,
hiding his body once again.

167 INT. THE FUN CENTER - MOMENTS LATER 167
Owen steps out of the bathroom and walks back through the
arcade, across a long row of games.
He nods to co-workers and to guests from the birthday party
as he passes them in the hallway.
ADULT OWEN
Sorry about that before. I'm sorry
about that. Just a new medication
I'm on.
No one's really paying much attention to him as he mumbles
these apologies.
And for Owen, everyone else in here is an out-of-focus blur,
blending together with the flashing lights of the arcade.
He apologizes to everyone he stumbles past, but there's
something more than embarrassment in his eyes:
Dawning terror. Like he's seen something that he can't unsee.
ADULT OWEN (CONT'D)
Hey I'm sorry about that before.
We stay close with Owen as he continues walking through the
arcade, continues apologizing to the bodies and lights
blurring past him.
He picks up his pace. He's rushing now, as if he wants to
beeline towards the emergency exit.
And still, he keeps apologizing as he rushes through the
space:
ADULT OWEN (CONT'D)
No. Yeah. I'm sorry about that. I'm
sorry--
We abruptly:
CUT TO BLACK.
