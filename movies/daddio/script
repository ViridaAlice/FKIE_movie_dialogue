(LEFT OF SCREEN TEXT)
?
The sound of a PLANE TAKING OFF swells, as-
INT. DREAMLIKE VOID (JFK ARRIVALS) - NIGHT
-Dancing pools of yellow, blue and red light permeate the
darkness, creating spots and halos... as if staring
directly into the sun.
2.
Within this dreamlike void, dark SHADOWS tease and flirt
in and out of frame, illusive and evasive- MUNDANE
AIRPORT NOISES issuing within, when-
From the calliope, a FIGURE takes human form, the form of
a YOUNG WOMAN, confidently walking toward camera in SLOW
MOTION, the shadows shown to be nothing more than
NONDESCRIPT TRAVELERS crisscrossing in the background.
The red and blue and yellow smatters of light also begin
to take solid form, revealing-
INT. JFK INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, ARRIVALS - NIGHT
-A grand terminal, towering with glass and steel, dimly
lit and relatively empty this late at night... creating a
feeling of a cold expansive loneliness.
Trailing a small piece of rolling luggage behind her,
this rare beauty continues to march in SLOW MOTION toward
camera with the hyper-focus of a seasoned New York
transplant.
As she draws nearer, the mesmerizing details of this
stunning creature come fully into focus...
GIRLIE, late 20s to early 30s, sporting thick-heeled,
black ankle-boots, kickass Dickies, a leather jacket and
scarf... short platinum blonde hair... and a face to
fucking die for.
As she marches onward-
The cacophony of NEW YORK CITY NOISE pierces through this
serene dreamlike scene with the HONKING of HORNS and the
ROAR of PASSING BUSES as- Girlie bursts out of the-
EXT. JFK INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, PASSENGER PICK UP - NIGHT
-Terminal, marching across two lanes of traffic- Toward a
sleepy YELLOW CAB LINE tucked just underneath a steal
overhang a short distance away, where- Forgotten taxis
are lined up, all resting in park-
EXT. JFK INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, TAXI LINE - NIGHT
-The rope-and-stanchion of the WAIT LINE holding TWO
INTERNATIONAL TOURISTS, 30s, a mother and a father, both
trying to soothe the CRIES of their fussy NEWBORN.
2.
3.
The feeling over here far more archaic, isolated,
obsolete and abandoned- Girlie taking her place in the
short line, giving the CRYING NEWBORN a slight, somber
glance as-
The TAXI LINE ATTENDANT, a man wearing a yellow vest,
50s, helps the tourists into a yellow cab and SLAM!
As the UNSEEN DRIVER of the next taxi inches forward, its
front passenger side window rolling down in anticipation-
The attendant lifts his receipt pad- To Girlie-
TAXI LINE ATTENDANT
Where to?
GIRLIE
(Standard American accent)
Manhattan. 44th, between 9th and 10th.
The attendant writes “MAN - 44 bt 9 + 10” on the ticket
and passes it off to the UNSEEN CABBIE through the front
passenger window, while-
Girlie walks the length of the vehicle to the back-
POP! goes the trunk, the UNSEEN CABBIE hopping out of the
front, slamming his door and rounding to the back on the
other side- Girlie paying him little mind as-
She parks her rolling luggage near the right taillight.
Then- With attitude-
Opens the backdoor - CLIP! - tosses her purse inside and -
SLAM!
INT. NYC YELLOW CAB, BACK SEAT - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)
Girlie disappears into the backseat. The darkness here
providing a comforting hiding place from the toxic,
yellow cloud of light pollution just outside - an urban,
mixed-florescent stew.
Remaining in the taxi, we stay tight on Girlie as the cab
rocks lightly with the weight of her luggage being thrown
into the trunk. Then- WHAM! The trunk shuts, hard.
Girlie TURNING OFF the small screen in front of her,
rejecting the endless stream of commercials as- The
MYSTERIOUS DRIVER passes her on the left side of the cab,
his likeness distorted by the glass, until-
3.
4.
CLIP! He opens the door, jumps in, and-
INT./EXT. NYC YELLOW CAB, FRONT SEAT - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)
SLAM! We finally come face to face with the driver-
CLARK, 50s, chomping on a wad of gum with the
determination of a Major League Baseball player.
At first glance, one might assume Clark to be a hardened,
blue-collar, New York stereotype.
Tough exterior.
Thick arms.
Faded puffer vest over a weathered t-shirt.
Rugged whiskers.
And a bold stare that is both alluring, and also... a
little dangerous.
Clark gives a quick glance at the receipt in his hand -
“MAN - 44 bt 9 + 10” - then tosses it on the passenger
seat beside him.
Casually, he adjusts his rearview mirror catching a
glimpse of his passenger paying him no mind at all as she
uses a small compact mirror to paint her lips.
It’s quite a sight to behold- As she presses her lips
together- Now perfectly tinted, when- Suddenly-
A HONK! HONK! issues from the taxi behind them, Clark
having been caught indulging himself. Startled-
CLARK
(thick New York accent)
Goddamit.
Throwing the cab in drive-
CLARK
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
With an aggressive TUG on the wheel, Clark successfully
pulls away from the curb-
Launching the two out into the night.
Neither Clark nor Girlie acknowledge their seat belts.
4.
5.
CLARK
(barely audible)
Fuckin’ asshole.
Slowly resuming the chomping of his gum, Clark pointedly
directs his eyes at the rearview, watching as-
Girlie takes off her scarf... the glow of the passing
lights outside hinting at something much deeper masked
underneath her strong, stoic, city stare-
Her gaze turning to the window, lost in thought, her
fresh lipstick - in this particular moment - more
resembling armor than a means of flirtation.
Clark wisely remains silent.
As the cab picks up speed, the yellow florescent cloud
outside begins to dissipate as the two make their way
onto Interstate 678.
EXT. INTERSTATE 678 AND BEYOND - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)
PULLIN UP AND AWAY from the yellow cab to more of a GOD’S
EYE VIEW, the awe and wonder of urban living becomes
evident through the beauty and poetry of light.
From high above, the many roadways, highways and freeways
that lead to the island of Manhattan look more like veins
pumping bioluminescent yellow and red life to and from
the heart chamber of an other worldly creature.
Moving back down again from macro to micro, we follow the
red taillights of countless vehicles racing along the
interstate until a bright yellow cab ZOOMS into frame.
The HUM of the cab’s rubber wheels kissing the asphalt
evoking a calming consistency.
HHHHUUUUUUUUUUUMMMMMMMM.
Yet... through the back window, the lonely silhouettes of
Clark and Girlie cause the cab to look more like a cage.
HHHHUUUUUUUUUUUMMMMMMMM.
INT. NYC YELLOW CAB, BACK SEAT - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)
CLOSE ON- Girlie’s face, gazing out. Her pensive
expression the perfect backdrop for the reflections of
yellow, red and blue streaks of reflective light -
resembling some abstract film projected upon her skin.
5.
6.
Finally, she pulls her gaze from the window and-
Carefully peeks at the rearview mirror ahead, gifting her
a quiet glimpse of this unknown driver who doesn’t seem
to be paying her any mind.
With a childlike intrigue, Girlie takes note of the
fascinating character before her:
- His strong jaw moving up and down as he chomps on his
gum.
- The gusto with which his thumbs lightly TAP percussion
on the steering wheel to some song stuck in his head.
- The thickness of his muscular arms.
- A few PHOTOS rubber-banded to his sun visor overhead.
Drawing a deep, quiet INHALE, Girlie unlocks her phone,
the device automatically picking up right where she left
off - to a very specific text message thread.
The one from our opening, ending with a question mark.
The light issuing from the screen creates a bright white
reflection in the darkness of her pupils.
CLOSE ON GIRLIE, wrestling with something.
Then- She composes a text- And sends-
GIRLIE (TEXT)
Landed
CLARK (O.S.)
So... 44th and 9th, huh?
Looking up, Girlie finds the reflection of her cabbie’s
eyes staring at her in the rearview.
She stares back.
GIRLIE
Yup.
CLARK
(chit-chat)
Midtown.
GIRLIE
Good ol’ Midtown.
Girlie locks her phone.

7.
INT. NYC YELLOW CAB, FRONT SEAT - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)
Up front, Clark wants to say more. But hesitates.
It’s dark in the cab.
And quiet.
Except for the ever present HUUUUUUMMMMMMM of rubber on
asphalt.
The street lamps of the interstate racing over them in
streaks of white light, contorting the darkness into
living shadows that seem to have a mind of their own.
Finally-
CLARK
You’re my last fare for the night.
Once again, Girlie confidently matches his stare in the
rearview.
GIRLIE
Yeah?
CLARK
Yeah.
A good-natured smile creeps across her lips-
GIRLIE
I won?
CLARK
You fuckin’ won, sweetheart. You did.
GIRLIE
And... What do I get? For winning?
CLARK
(mildly sexual)
Anything you want.
Girlie still doesn’t look away, causing Clark to continue
to “test the waters” a bit.
CLARK
Yeah, I had a rough day of it. Short
trips, barely nothin’ extra. This fuckin’
business with the credit cards. When it
was cash? People’d throw you a ten,
twenty, fifty. “Keep the change” ain’t a
cliché no more.
(MORE)
7.
CLARK (CONT’D)
8.
And when it was, it was nice. When it’s
paper, you hand it over. Fucking Monopoly
money, right? But you swipe that plastic,
you got time to think. You stare at all
those little numbers, and before you know
it - I get fucked up the asshole.
He looks to Girlie again in the rearview.
She seems intrigued enough.
CLARK
It’s these fuckin’ apps, all of ‘em - can
get a coffee, burger, soap, socks, wine,
water, weed, fuckin’ Chinese takeout -
you can get all that shit, and never
reach for your purse, not even for tip.
Nah, it’s all up in that cloud up there.
That big fuckin’ cloud, thinkin’ it knows
better. Swearin’ it can keep a secret.
But what happens when that cloud starts
leakin’, huh? What happens when it starts
to rain? You bet your ass we’re gonna
wish we’d stuck with the Monopoly money,
am I right?
(a beat)
I mean... salt used to be money. Mother
fuckin’ salt. The same shit you sprinkle
on your eggs. Yeah. Every mornin’ you
toss that cheap-ass-shit all over your
eggs with no idea that people used to die
for it. Tea, coffee, same thing. All that
shit you gloss over at the grocery store,
at one point in time, humans fuckin’
killed each other for it.
(a brief pause)
Bird’s eye view of that shit? Over the
years, you see money go from salt to gold
to paper and now? Money? It ain’t nothin’
but an idea. Little numbers on a screen.
You can’t touch it, can’t bury it, can’t
put a little “x” that marks the spot-
Nah... you just tie it to a fuckin’
butterfly and send it to that cloud up
there. But, one of these days, I’m
tellin’ ya, that cloud’s gonna open up
and it’s gonna pour acid rain down, all
over our dumb faces... Yellow cabs don’t
play that game. Not in New York. Too much
bullshit.
Playfully, Girlie offers a clever smirk.
CLARK (CONT’D)
8.
(MORE)
9.
GIRLIE
I got ya covered.
CLARK
Yeah?
GIRLIE
Yeah. My bag in the back should settle
us.
CLARK
How?
GIRLIE
(teasing)
It’s full of salt.
Clark chuckles. Sincerely surprised by her quick wit.
CLARK
That’s good...
(a beat)
For that- You can use a damn credit card,
honey. It is what it is at this point.
But, back in the day, shit, we fought it,
we all fought it. Cash is king, ya know?
(a slight pause)
Million dollars for a fuckin’ Medallion,
and they still put that credit card shit
in my back seat. And one day soon, like
that, they’re gonna come back and rip it
out again, like it was nothin’... Credit
card machines, they’re gonna be like
fuckin’ pay phones. Just sittin’ there.
Lookin’ dumb. Waitin’. Waitin’ for
somebody, anybody to give ‘em a ring.
Havin’ no idea... the world’s moved on.
(a beat)
And... I guess I’m no different. I
mean... cabs, yellow cabs? We’re fuckin’
Blockbuster, ya know? We’re fightin’ it
all too hard, swimmin’ up stream. Busy
swimmin’ and missin’ the whole fuckin’
boat... Me, too. I been fightin’ it, too.
Swimmin’, swimmin’ hard...
(another beat)
But... I don’t know... If we’re
Blockbuster... it’s already too late. Ten
years time, there ain’t gonna be no
yellow no more. And all those other guys,
the ones with the apps, the guys takin’
over? They are gonna be nothin’ but a
blip on the screen. Fuckin’ blink of an
eye... when it’s all said and done.
(MORE)
9.
CLARK (CONT’D)
10.
(a pause)
Yeah... you’ll order up a car on your
phone, just like before, but when you hop
in, it ain’t gonna be no human behind the
wheel, I can tell ya that. You’ll order
up a car and that fuckin’ car will drive
itself to wherever-the-fuck you wanna go.
And it won’t speed, won’t stink, won’t
make ya sick, won’t ever get lost. Might
even ask you ‘bout your day... Fuckin’
apps.
A beat. Then-
CLARK
Want some radio?
GIRLIE
Not really.
CLARK
Yeah, it all sounds the same. ‘Specially
in my business. After so many hours,
drivin’ around... all sounds the same.
In the quiet that follows, it seems Girlie is still
studying him with intrigue, begging the question-
CLARK
You-uh... you ever get a cabbie before
that was-uh... ya know... that was born
state-side?
GIRLIE
Uh... I’ve never thought about it.
CLARK
Think about it.
GIRLIE
(after a beat)
I don’t know, I... I guess I haven’t.
Clark nods his head, processing something.
GIRLIE
Is that supposed to mean something?
CLARK
Not really. I mean... some people...
Sometimes people ask about it.
GIRLIE
Really?
CLARK (CONT’D)
10.
11.
CLARK
Yeah. Like, one guy, some Wall Street
fuckin’ douche... he wanted to know why.
GIRLIE
Why what?
CLARK
Why I’m drivin’ a cab. Wanted to know how
I fucked up so bad.
GIRLIE
That’s... disturbing. For a lot of
reasons.
CLARK
Right?! I fuckin’ pull over, right then,
turn around and tell the guy, “Ride’s
over, buddy, get the fuck outta my cab.”
Guy jumps out, don’t even pay.
After a beat, he beams at Girlie in the rearview-
CLARK
Didn’t even occur to you.
She simply shakes her head. Clark seems very pleased with
this stranger in the back, allowing himself to reveal a
vulnerable touch of melancholy.
CLARK
It’s just... weird, ya know? I mean. I
used to be exactly what you’d expect
behind the wheel of a New York City cab.
And now... I don’t know. I guess. Nothin’
stays the same no-more...
(a pensive beat)
And... I guess... it’s better that way.
For the most part. Can’t say I didn’t
have a good run.
Silence. Then-
CLARK
Nice you’re not on your phone. I mean,
you don’t have to keep talkin’ to me or
nothin’, but... it’s just nice. You know.
To see a human. Not plugged in.
GIRLIE
Yeah, I need a break from it.
11.
12.
CLARK
(after a beat)
Picked up a couple this mornin’,
LaGuardia, older couple. And they got
their-uh, I don’t know, their
granddaughter with ‘em - fifteen,
sixteen. And she’s just textin’, the
whole ride. First time in the city, and
she don’t say a word. I make a joke to
grandma - I was like, “So, what, ya ask
her questions and she texts ya the
answers?” Grandma laughed, but Princess
gives me a glare. A glare, mind you, but
still no fuckin’ word - barely looked out
the window. And get this shit. I drop ‘em
off near Macy’s, right? Pop open the
trunk, start helpin’ Grandpa with the
bags - Empire State, right there. I point
it out to Grandpa, he points it out to
Princess, and all of a sudden, Princess
holds out her phone and snaps a fuckin’
picture - all smilin’ at the camera, big
toothy grin - lookin’ all excited and
shit. And then... she’s back on her
phone. Not smilin’. Not talkin’. Nothin’.
Just sendin’ a fuckin’ butterfly to that
cloud up there. Makin’ her friends all
jealous she’s in the big city. When the
truth is?
In the rearview, Clark LOCKS EYES with Girlie-
CLARK
She never fuckin’ showed up.
Amazed by the thoughts rattling around in this cabbie’s
head, Girlie’s genuine gaze glows with curiosity.
GIRLIE
What’s your name?
CLARK
Why?
GIRLIE
Just like to know people’s names.
CLARK
Fuck. You really are a human, aren’t ya?
That’s sweet.
He smiles at her reflection, a bashful shyness surfacing
then submerging again, quickly.
12.
13.
CLARK
Clark.
Thoughtfully absorbing the name-
GIRLIE
Clark.
-Girlie spots Clark’s TAXI DRIVER’S ID displayed in the
far left corner of the plexiglass. His “mugshot” a bit
disheveled. As if he rolled out of bed right before the
photo was taken. Playfully “calling her out”-
CLARK
You thought I’d say Vinnie or some shit.
Girlie lets out an intoxicating laugh.
GIRLIE
I... I don’t know what I thought.
CLARK
Ah, it’s fine. I mean. Shit. We pass out
these names, ya know, random ass names to
these cute, little babies. Any name you
want. Whatever-the-fuck has a nice ring
to it. Whatever-the-fuck gives you high
hopes for higher education and bullshit.
But that little thing in your arms, it’s
never gonna be exactly what you had in
mind. I mean, Clark plays tennis, he’s
got a house in the Hamptons, goes to
opera and shit. I just ain’t that guy.
GIRLIE
What name would you choose? If you could?
CLARK
(with a shrug)
Ah... Vinnie.
INT. NYC YELLOW CAB, BACK SEAT - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)
Girlie watches Clark as his eyes find her in the
rearview.
CLARK
So-uh... You live here, right?
GIRLIE
I do.
13.
14.
CLARK
Yeah, your little outfit gave you away.
GIRLIE
(with a chuckle)
My outfit?
CLARK
Says a lot about ya.
GIRLIE
What does it say?
CLARK
That you can handle yourself.
GIRLIE
How can you possibly know that?
CLARK
It ain’t that difficult to read people. I
mean. You jumped in, business as usual,
ya turned off that damn little screen
back there, ‘cause you already know what
fuckin’ Broadway shows are playin’, and
you didn’t even think to reach for your
seat belt. Why would you? You’ve had
enough rides. In and out, am I right?
GIRLIE
(intrigued)
What else?
CLARK
You gave me cross streets, not some
recited fuckin’ address from your phone.
And I can tell you’re not concerned with
the meter, ‘cause you already know JFK’s
a flat rate.
GIRLIE
Impressive.
CLARK
(a chuckle)
I’m not claimin’ to be some Sherlock or
nothin’. Just a guy who pays attention.
You’ve had a long day. You’re tired. You
wanna go home, take a shower, sleep in
your own bed. And. You got in line for a
mother fuckin’ taxi. Now- That’s a New
Yorker that pays attention. Someone who
knows what the fuck’s goin’ on. And-
14.
15.
Once again, they LOCK EYES in the rearview.
CLARK
You’re not afraid to look me in the eye.
(a beat)
Like I said. You can handle yourself.
Girlie’s smile hints at sadness.
GIRLIE
I like to think so.
Suddenly, Clark rolls down his window, inviting a rush of
wind to fill the taxi with its fresh breath and all
encompassing SOUND.
PPPSSSSSSHHHHHHHHHHH!
Then- Clark rears back and launches his wad of gum out
the window with a loud-
HOCK!
The gross act causes Girlie to grin, a glimpse that she’s
super chill as fuck underneath.
Yet, her amusement quickly fades as she glances down at
her iPhone.
PPPSSSSSSHHHHHHHHHHH!
Looking like an addict staring at a heroine needle,
Girlie’s face begins to contort with a sudden,
irresistible urge.
She bites her right thumbnail, the SOUND of the wind
decrescendo-ing into SILENCE as Clark rolls up his
window.
In the following moment of suspended stillness, Girlie
closes her eyes for but a moment’s peace, until-
Her eyes open wide with aching addiction, Girlie flips
over her phone and unlocks it to find two texts waiting-
L (TEXT)
Home yet?
Can I drop by?
She composes a reply- And sends-
GIRLIE (TEXT)
In a cab

16.
L (TEXT)

CLOSE ON GIRLIE. Staring at her phone, not responding.
CLARK (O.S.)
Where ya flyin’ from?
GIRLIE
Oklahoma.
She composes a text-
And sends-
16.
17.
GIRLIE (TEXT)
I can’t remember, I just started learning
CLARK (O.S.)
What’s in Oklahoma?
The three gray dots appear again, promising a response.
GIRLIE
I grew up there.
WE STAY ON GIRLIE. When-
L (TEXT)
when do you get home??
ON GIRLIE- The weight of the world resting in this
moment. When- She finally composes her answer-
GIRLIE (TEXT)
it’s going to be late
maybe another time?
L (TEXT)
(...)
But I need you
(...)

(...)
L (TEXT)

Suddenly, Girlie locks her phone.
CLARK (O.S.)
Hey-
17.
18.
INT. NYC YELLOW CAB, FRONT SEAT - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)
CLARK
What about your accent?
In the backseat, Girlie glances up at Clark, in a daze.
GIRLIE
Sorry... What?
INT. NYC YELLOW CAB, BACK SEAT - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)
On Girlie, confused as to what he’s talking about.
CLARK
Your accent.
GIRLIE
My accent?
CLARK
Yeah. Don’t people from Oklahoma -
(badly imitating a Midwestern
accent)
- talk like this?
Girlie relaxes, allowing a chuckle.
GIRLIE
Not all of us, apparently.
INT. NYC YELLOW CAB, FRONT SEAT - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)
A beat. Then. Clark continues, clearly committed to
keeping this mysterious beauty happily distracted from
whatever-the-hell she’s got happening on her phone.
CLARK
Where ya from, what part of the state?
GIRLIE
Just. A tiny little town.
CLARK
What’s the town?
GIRLIE
You’ve never heard of it.
CLARK
What’s the town?
18.
19.
Clearly enjoying the distraction, Girlie extends her
right arm.
GIRLIE
Okay, so... Oklahoma’s shaped like a pan,
right? So if- If my arm’s the panhandle,
then- I grew up here.
She points to her right armpit.
CLARK
The armpit.
GIRLIE
Of Oklahoma. Yep.
CLARK
What’s it called?
GIRLIE
Gage.
CLARK
Gage, Oklahoma.
GIRLIE
You got it.
CLARK
How many people?
GIRLIE
Four hundred-ish.
CLARK
Huh. (after a pause)
I honest-to-god would have never guessed
Oklahoma.
GIRLIE
What would you have guessed?
CLARK
Not an armpit, I can tell you that.
(a beat)
How long you been in New York?
GIRLIE
Nine years, in June.
CLARK
No shit.
19.
20.
GIRLIE
No shit. One more year, and I’ll be
official.
CLARK
Yeah... but let’s be honest, you’re
official now. Anyone who chooses for nine
years to wait at the post office until
the idea of “goin’ postal” starts to have
a nice ring to it - anyone who chooses
for nine years to ride around in those
little sardine cans underground, some guy
rubbin’ up against you like some dog
humpin’ your leg - anyone who chooses for
nine years to drag loads of laundry down
the street to fight off a tough-ass-broad
for some machine that eats up all your
quarters and gives ya bedbugs - and all
for the privilege of gettin’ a whiff of
that sweet ‘n sour piss aroma every now
and again as you run down the street,
eatin’ your mornin’ bagel? You’re a
fuckin’ New Yorker.
(after a pause)
That is... unless you got money and don’t
do any of that shit. That’s-uh... that’s
a different New York, altogether. Might
as well be another fuckin’ planet.
GIRLIE
I did all that. For a long time.
CLARK
And what changed for ya?
GIRLIE
Worked my ass off.
CLARK
What’cha do? For work?
GIRLIE
I’m a programmer.
CLARK
Computers?
GIRLIE
Computers.
CLARK
No shit.
20.
21.
GIRLIE
No shit.
CLARK
Like ones and zeros and shit?
GIRLIE
Like ones and zeros and shit.
(playfully “calling him out”
this time)
You thought I’d say something more girly,
didn’t ya?
CLARK
(laughing)
Yeah, like a weddin’ planner or fashion
or somethin’.
GIRLIE
Not as many women code, I’ll give you
that.
CLARK
And you drew a line in the sand. Lifted
your leg and made your mark.
GIRLIE
(with a grin)
I don’t mind squatting.
Captivated by her reflection-
CLARK
So... what’s the deal with the ones and
zeros?
GIRLIE
Like...?
CLARK
They’re like building blocks or whatnot,
right? Like. When I look at my computer,
I’m really lookin’ at a bunch of ones and
zeros or some shit.
GIRLIE
Yeah. Something like that.
CLARK
No, tell me. I honest-to-god wanna know.
Can’t be a know-it-all if I don’t know
nothin’.
21.
22.
For emphasis, Girlie perches on the back seat, drawing
closer to the plexiglass between them.
Clark shifts his weight, doing his best not to look too
excited by the sudden change of her proximity.
GIRLIE
Basically... a computer uses electricity
to create “on” and “off” states that can
represent ones and zeros. One being “on”
and zero being “off.” But- They more
often represent the idea of... “true” or
“false.”
CLARK
(amused)
Ones and zeros mean... true or false?
GIRLIE
Not always- They can also represent
numbers and other things, too, but- Much
of what I do is testing whether something
is true or false. I’ve always used “one”
to mean “true”- And-
CLARK
“Zero” to mean “false.”
GIRLIE
You got it.
CLARK
Huh.
GIRLIE
(a strong beat)
Everything in a computer - color, images,
music, money, three dimensional worlds,
all of it - is represented by ones and
zeros.
CLARK
True and false.
GIRLIE
Correct. It’s basically how... everything
you see... operates.
Pensively, Clark analyses this new information as he
grabs his thermos nearby and takes a swig of water.
MATCH CUT TO:
22.
23.
INT. NYC YELLOW CAB, BACK SEAT - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)
Having come closer to the plexiglass, Girlie now has a
better view of Clark, something in her eyes registering
surprise by how handsome this cabbie truly is up close.
Then.
She observes quietly as... Clark gifts a drink of water
to a sweet little plant resting in a cupholder.
Her eyes welling with emotion seeing this tender act come
from such an unlikely person.
Then. With a shrug-
CLARK
I mean... makes sense. We all do that.
Lay down our bricks of ones and zeros and
build our own little fort. And that shit,
it starts young. I mean, think about it.
“You are stupid.” True or false? “You are
ugly.” True or false? “Your mother loves
you.” True or false? And when you grow
up? That shit don’t stop. “Climate
Change.” True or false? “Jesus Christ.”
True or false? “I must wear pants today.”
True or fuckin’ false. And on and on it
goes.
SITTING BACK, Girlie falls silent a moment. When-
CLARK
We all gotta choose our ones and zeros.
And whatever we decide... yeah... that
becomes the foundation from which we
operate.
As if in reply, Girlie grins at him, playfully.
CLARK
Or. Maybe I’m just talkin’ bullshit.
GIRLIE
(“False.”)
Zero.
INT. NYC YELLOW CAB, FRONT SEAT - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)
With a chuckle, Clark’s bashful side surfaces, then
quickly submerges again.
23.
24.
CLARK
You’re a... you’re a surprising person, I
gotta say.
GIRLIE
Awwwww, shucks.
CLARK
Very little surprises me these days.
Silence. Then-
GIRLIE
And... what about you?
CLARK
What about me what?
GIRLIE
Where are you from?
CLARK
Hell’s Kitchen. Or. What was Hell’s
Kitchen. Not too far from where we’re
goin’.
GIRLIE
What was it like, when you were a kid?
CLARK
Back in my day? Man. If Hell really did
have a kitchen... that was it. Junkies on
every stoop. Hookers on every corner. It
was fantastic.
GIRLIE
Still live in Manhattan?
CLARK
Own a place. Jackson Heights. Small
house.
GIRLIE
Still. It’s a house.
CLARK
You better fuckin’ believe it.
GIRLIE
So... Clark lives in Queens.
CLARK
No, no, no... Vinnie lives in Queens.
Clark’s gotta loft in Tribeca.
24.
(MORE)
25.
GIRLIE
(with a chuckle)
Right, right.
Suddenly, Clark notices something up ahead, causing him
to tap the breaks.
CLARK
Oh, fuck. That ain’t good.
CLARK’S POV - Through the windshield, a wall of
stationary red taillights force the cab to come to a
complete stop.
INT./EXT. NYC YELLOW CAB, BACK SEAT - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)
Turning, Girlie gazes out the back window, squinting
against the wall of yellow headlights crowding in from
behind.
The two have been captured between uncompromising walls
of red and yellow light, the street lamps overhead
glaring down, fixed florescent stars in the night sky.
Utter gridlock.
The worst kind.
The New York kind.
CLARK
Dammit. Got some kinda fender bender up
there.
INT./EXT. NYC YELLOW CAB, FRONT SEAT - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)
They both look ahead at the flickering emergency lights
not too far in the distance, pulsing red and blue.
Clark aggressively throws the cab in park - THRUST! “P.”
CLARK
Sorry, sweetie. I hate this shit.
GIRLIE
Not your fault.
CLARK
I fuckin’ know these roads like the back
of my hand. But still can’t predict the
weather, ya know?
(MORE)
25.
CLARK (CONT’D)
26.
That’s the one thing those fuckin’ apps
got on me, that’s the one fuckin’ thing.
GIRLIE
It’s fine. Really.
CLARK
(at a loss)
It’s not fine. It’s not professional.
Should’ve been payin’ attention- Could’ah
got off back there.
GIRLIE
(a beat, teasing)
Well? I’m on the flat rate, so-
CLARK
(a laugh)
Nah, I’m gonna meter your ass!
GIRLIE
Nope. I won. I won again. Two to zero.
CLARK
Leavin’ me in the dust over here.
INT. NYC YELLOW CAB, BACK SEAT - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)
All is still. Too still.
All is quiet. Too quiet.
Girlie watches as Clark begins to TAP percussion on the
steering wheel again - unable to sit still.
As his thumbs DRUM to some unknown rhythm, Girlie’s gaze
falls to her purse.
The BEAT of the driver’s thumbs crescendoes in Girlie’s
mind as that wave of fierce addiction washes over her
again.
TAP, TAP, TAP - goes the “drums.”
She softly bites her bottom lip.
TAP, TAP, TAP.
The emergency lights pulsing red and blue-
A glimpse of humanity.
A reminder.
CLARK (CONT’D)
26.
(MORE)
27.
That we’re built... to make mistakes.
TAP, TAP, TAP.
In a daze, Girlie reaches inside her purse, pulls out her
phone and unlocks it to find-
Two new texts await.
L (TEXT)
You there?
Lost you
Girlie drafts a reply. With the phone still muted, this
time the clicking “typewriter” sound has been replaced
with SILENCE.
GIRLIE (TEXT)
Lo siento.
Stuck in traffico
Surprisingly, she receives an immediate response-
L (TEXT)
(...)
K
(...)
How was the trip?
GIRLIE (TEXT)
It was a hard trip.
(TEXT)
Good. But hard
L (TEXT)
(...)
I’m hard
Girlie looks wounded. Frustrated. Angry. But she has no
time to reply, because-
L (TEXT)
(...)
Missed yo

*you

27.
L (TEXT) (CONT'D)
28.
(...)
Need you

Need your pink

your sweet tits
(...)
If you can’t meet me

help me cum
Red and blue pulsing on her face, Girlie simply stares at
the slew of texts before her.
Biting her right thumbnail, she sits perfectly still as-
Waving gray dots appear.
L (TEXT)
(...)
Then disappear.
Then appear.
L (TEXT)
(...)
Then disappear again.
Girlie’s disengagement has clearly caused “L” to greatly
question what he should say next.
Finally-
L (TEXT) (CONT'D)
28.
29.
L (TEXT)
(...)
You their?
(...)
*there
(...)
???
A beat. Then. Waving gray dots appear.
L (TEXT)
(...)
Then. Disappear again into nothing.
CLOSE ON GIRLIE.
Pulling her thumbnail from her mouth, she begins to
compose another text in the darkness of the back seat.
Red and blue.
GIRLIE (TEXT)
Here
L (TEXT)
(...)
She bites her thumbnail again as she waits.
L (TEXT)
(...)
Will you?
She pulls her thumbnail from her mouth.
GIRLIE (TEXT)
Will I what?
L (TEXT)

Girlie lightly shakes her head, her eyes softly rolling
in agitation, while even more texts arrive-
29.
30.
L (TEXT)
(...)
Mmmmm
(...)
cock so hard
(...)
throbbing
(...)
You have to see
(...)
what you do to me
Girlie glances up, paranoid that Clark might be watching.
He isn’t.
He remains distracted by the song in his head.
TAP, TAP, TAP.
Girlie looks down at her phone again-
FROM GIRLIE’S POV ON HER PHONE - We see a bathroom-stall-
dick-pic has just been delivered.
REVERSE ON GIRLIE’S REACTION-
Her face bursting with a fascinating mix of haunting
sadness and wild irritation. And yet. She still writes-
GIRLIE (TEXT)
Oh baby
L (TEXT)
(...)
u like?
Girlie habitually puts her thumbnail between her teeth,
not knowing how to respond, when-
CLARK (O.S.)
How long were you in Oklahoma?
SNAPPING BACK TO REALITY, Girlie looks up from her phone.
30.
31.
GIRLIE
(covering)
Uh... Two weeks.
CLARK
(after a beat)
You-uh, visitin’ family or somethin’?
GIRLIE
I have a half sister.
GIRLIE’S GLANCES AGAIN AT HER PHONE. The gray dots have
begun their dance again.
L (TEXT)
(...)
Girlie waits. Finally-
L (TEXT)
want to cum for you
(...)
need you to watch
Suddenly, a call from “L” fills her screen, the contact
wanting to FaceTime.
REVERSE ON GIRLIE.
Utter SILENCE, as if all the air has been sucked out of
the taxi.
Girlie herself literally holding her breath.
Red, blue. Red, blue.
Deeply conflicted, Girlie doesn’t blink for a long
pause... until the FaceTime call falls away.
INT. NYC YELLOW CAB, FRONT SEAT - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)
Clark watches as Girlie quickly locks her phone again and
places it face down on her lap.
CLARK
What’s she like? Your sister?
Taking her time to answer, Girlie stares out the window
again - red taillights illuminating her from the
windshield, yellow headlights from behind. Creating a
cage. Or confessional. Of light.
31.
32.
GIRLIE
(quietly)
She’s... Honestly, she’s kind of a bitch.
CLARK
How she a bitch? What she do?
GIRLIE
Little things, like... she makes fun of
my cankles.
CLARK
Your cankles?
GIRLIE
I have thick ankles.
CLARK
I don’t believe that.
GIRLIE
It’s true.
CLARK
But you’re small.
GIRLIE
I’m small and I have thick ankles.
CLARK
That’s a thing?
GIRLIE
It’s a thing.
CLARK
Huh. Sounds cute.
GIRLIE
Thank you, it is cute.
With a wry grin, Girlie attempts to mask the emotion
pulsing in her veins.
CLARK
I take it that... you and the bitch don’t
visit all that often?
GIRLIE
Hadn’t seen her in years.
CLARK
Why?
32.
(MORE)
33.
GIRLIE
We just stopped talking. We didn’t have a
fight or anything, we just... stopped
talking.
CLARK
Why now?
GIRLIE
She tracked me down. Asked me to visit.
Had no reason to say no.
CLARK
How she track you down? The cloud?
GIRLIE
The cloud.
CLARK
Acid rain?
GIRLIE
We had a nice time. I mean- She’s a total
bitch, but we laughed a lot. We drank a
lot and we laughed a lot.
CLARK
She married?
GIRLIE
She has a girlfriend.
CLARK
Nice.
GIRLIE
Named Eagle.
CLARK
(genuinely loving this)
Fuck me. She Native American or
somethin’?
GIRLIE
That’s right.
CLARK
Well, that’s some cool-ass-shit-right-
there.
GIRLIE
Yeah, they seem happy. Live in a trailer,
just got a parakeet... saving up to do
some traveling next year.
(MORE)
33.
GIRLIE (CONT’D)
34.
(after a beat)
She’s come a long way.
CLARK
She older, younger?
INT. NYC YELLOW CAB, BACK SEAT - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)
Girlie takes off her jacket, getting even more cozy in
the backseat-
GIRLIE
She-uh... she was eleven when I was born,
so... she was like a mom growing up. But
she was a fucked up mom, like... she used
to tie me up, ankle to ankle, wrist to
wrist, and put me in the bathtub and lock
me in the bathroom.
CLARK
What the fuck? Bathtub full?
GIRLIE’S POV ON CLARK’S EYES IN THE REARVIEW. Eyes that
offer a surprising softness. An empathy. Empathy that can
only be crafted from a long life of heard knocks.
GIRLIE
Empty.
This new information seems to have rattle Clark to the
core. One might wonder if it speaks to something much
deeper. A time when. Memories this man has long since
left behind.
CLARK
(softly)
Why the fuck would she do that?
GIRLIE
(softly back)
It was... her way of helping me practice.
CLARK
Practice what?
GIRLIE
If I ever got kidnapped, I’d be able to
escape. That was her logic.
Clark has been rendered speechless, his thoughts held
captive by something, something disturbing.
GIRLIE (CONT’D)
34.
35.
His cab in park, that stubborn, sinister wall of red
taillights before him-
Clark TURNS HIS BODY FOR THE FIRST TIME. And. Curiously
slides the plexiglass window open. The two locking eyes
without that barrier between them. Engaging in a real
human connection, advancing these two souls far beyond
mere reflections in a rearview mirror.
CLARK
(softly, simply)
Did you like bein’ tied up?
The cab suddenly ceases to be “front seat” and “back
seat.” Somehow this place, this metal cage, has
emotionally expanded.
And.
You can feel it.
CLOSE ON CLARK. Waiting for her answer.
CLOSE ON GIRLIE. Finally finding her answer.
GIRLIE
(sincerely)
I liked the challenge of getting free.
CLOSE ON CLARK. With a deep understanding, almost as if
he’s talking about himself-
CLARK
You got loose... didn’t ya? You sat there
in that bathroom... in that cold, empty
tub... for God knows how long... and you
wiggled yourself free. Every. Fuckin’.
Time.
CLOSE ON GIRLIE. A resiliency washing over her face. Red
and blue.
CLOSE ON CLARK. A shared understanding. Red and blue.
These two are survivors.
GIRLIE
Kidnappers be damned.
CLARK
Like I said... you can handle yourself.
We hold here. Caught in a staring standoff, when-
35.
36.
CLARK
You get a prize or somethin’? For gettin’
loose?
GIRLIE
Not really. By the time I’d get free...
my sister would be at work or whatever.
CLARK
And. Where was mom?
GIRLIE
Mom was gone.
CLARK
Where’d she go?
GIRLIE
(with a deep, dramatic voice)
Mom went out for a pack of smokes and
never came back.
CLARK
That’s funny. You’re funny... What are
you? Twenty-five? Twenty-six?
Shaking her head-
GIRLIE
No, I don’t answer that question.
CLARK
Why the hell not?
GIRLIE
Because. It’s bullshit.
CLARK
What, you weird about your age or
somethin’?
GIRLIE
(with a chuckle)
The whole world’s weird about my age! If
I told you I was twenty-four or thirty-
four, your opinion of me would
drastically change.
CLARK
That is not true.
36.
37.
GIRLIE
For women? It is. It is fucking true. The
moment we hit thirty, our value’s cut in
half.
CLARK
I mean...
CLARK
Fine, fuck it, it’s true. It is true.
But, listen, you really do look twenty-
somethin’, but - by the way you talk all
smart and shit - if I wasn’t lookin’, I’d
guess you were fifty, so-
GIRLIE
So what does it matter how many times
I’ve been around the sun?
Put in his place, Clark draws a breath, but cannot muster
a reply. Then-
CLARK
Hell if I know... It’s just a question, I
guess. Somethin’ people ask. Maybe you’re
right, maybe it is bullshit.
(a beat)
I guess... it’s just my way of... tryin’
to understand.
GIRLIE
Understand what?
CLARK
It is a bit confusin’ to meet some chick
who looks twenty-two, but so clearly is a
fuckin’ rocket ship.
GIRLIE
(amused)
A rocket ship, huh?
He imitates the SOUND of a NASA rocket launching,
accompanied with a hand gesture.
CLARK
That’s you.
GIRLIE
(like a badass boss)
Yeah. That is me.
CLARK
Feel it. Own it.
37.
38.
GIRLIE
Oh, I feel it.
CLARK
Gonna take over the whole wide world, no
question.
GIRLIE
I’ll build a small empire and leave the
rest.
CLARK
(after a chuckle)
You-uh... you plan on sharing that Empire
with someone? A boyfriend or...
girlfriend or... whatnot?
Girlie’s smile fades.
CLARK
What? You need me to kick someone’s ass?
GIRLIE
Nah. It’s okay.
CLARK
What’s their name?
GIRLIE
His name doesn’t matter.
CLARK
He fuck up that bad?
No reply.
CLARK
Come on. I told you my name, let’s hear
his.
GIRLIE
I’d rather not say.
CLARK
Oh. I see. I get it.
This grabs her attention.
GIRLIE
You get what?
CLARK
He’s married. I get it.
38.
39.
Girlie doesn’t say anything for a pause.
Red and blue. Red and blue.
Finally-
GIRLIE
Why do you think he’s married?
CLARK
You could’ve said his name and how would
I ever know? As if there’s only one Bob
or Sam or Jeff in New-York-fuckin’-City.
Nah... you so afraid to say a name? The
guy’s married. Or you’re married. Or
someone’s fuckin’ married and no one
wants to say that shit out loud. Gum?
GIRLIE
... Yes, please.
Pulling a stick of gum, Clark offers it to Girlie.
Accepting his gift, Girlie takes a beat to allow the
minty treat to soften in her mouth, when-
GIRLIE
(plainly)
He’s married.
CLARK
I know he’s fuckin’ married. I know
people. Don’t drive a cab for twenty
years and not know people.
CLOSE ON CLARK- A gleam in his eyes-
CLARK
Word of advice? And this is comin’ from a
man married twice with a lotta action on
the side - ya ready?
(no reply)
Don’t ever say the word “love.” All
right? Just... don’t say it.
Silence.
CLARK
Oh, sweetheart... You fuckin’ said it,
didn’t you?
No reply.
39.
40.
CLARK
You did! You said the fuckin’ “L” word!
Oh, God, honey! That’s fuckin’ suicide in
that world, didn’t you know that?! Fuck!
He does not want to hear that from you.
He wants to hear it from his mother, his
wife, his kids - but he does not want to
hear that shit from you. In the cognitive
wheel that is his life, that is not your
function.
GIRLIE
And what is my function?
CLARK
Sex! Touch me, suck me, lick me, but do
not love me. Don’t you fuckin’ love me.
This time, Girlie opens her mouth to say something, but
falters. It takes a few tries until-
GIRLIE
I’m not... that girl, okay? I just- I
couldn’t not say it anymore.
CLARK
And what? He’s supposed to love you back?
He’s supposed to ride in on a big, white
horse and whisk you away to some cliff in
Greece? Live out his days braidin’ your
hair with wild flowers and forget-me-
nots? No fuckin’ way.
(a beat)
He’s not gonna be there when your olive
oil dries up, sweetheart. You’re not that
important. He knows that, I know that,
but you - you just gotta catch up, it’s
all right. Gotta change your ones to
zeros, sweetie, I get it, it takes time.
Girlie wants to say something, but sits utterly
dumbfounded. Clark, in true form, barrels forward.
CLARK
Honest-to-God, my first wife was
everything you’d ever want. Five-eight,
hundred and fifteen pounds, tits out to
here - hair full of bleach and a head
full of nothin’. Men love women that are
dumb as shit. They’re fuckin’ pigs in the
bedroom. Mother-fuckin’-pigs and we love
that shit.
40.
41.
GIRLIE
You think smart women-
CLARK
Cannot reduce themselves to pigs in the
bedroom. That is right. Can’t have it
both ways, don’t exist.
GIRLIE
That is zero true.
CLARK
You’re a smart girl, went to college -
read a lot, talk politics, all that shit?
GIRLIE
Yes.
CLARK
You ever been a pig in the bedroom?
GIRLIE
(frustrated)
What’s your definition of a pig?
Clark throws his head back, howling with laughter.
CLARK
You see! Dumb chicks don’t need
explainin’ - they just do it! That was my
first wife. Man... everything a guy could
ask for.
For a moment, Clark loses himself in what must be fond
memories. But, it quickly fades.
CLARK
But, uh... she-uh... she starts gainin’
weight, right? And it makes her feel bad
about herself and she stops wantin’ to,
ya know-
GIRLIE
(dryly)
Oink?
CLARK
Do her wifely duty or whatnot. And, in no
time flat, honest-to-God, I go out and
find myself a nineteen-year-old, put her
up in an apartment down the street, pay
for the whole damn thing.
41.
42.
GIRLIE
Are you fucking serious?
CLARK
Oh, yeah. Cute little thing. Polish. Long
legs. Fucked the shit out of her. Best
year of my life. Would’ve kept her around
longer, but-
GIRLIE
Ahhh... the “L” word.
CLARK
Not your function. You are there because
their wives had kids and got fat. Or
their wives have a career, or cancer, or
whatever-the-fuck it is - men don’t want
to hear that shit come outta your mouth.
They barely want you to say a word at
all.
GIRLIE
So why get married? Why don’t men just
stay single so they can fuck whoever,
whenever?
With a cheeky grin, Clark corrects her grammar-
CLARK
Whomever.
GIRLIE
Oh-my-god- Seriously?
With a chuckle, Clark continues, very much enjoying this
lively debate. Clearly, he loves to “get under the skin.”
CLARK
Men? We wanna look good for other men, if
that makes sense. We wanna have a fancy
suit, big house, fast car. “He who dies
with the most toys wins.” Sure, that’s
talkin’ about the suit, the house, the
car, but... it also includes the wife and
the kids. Toys.
(a beat)
Now. Lotta guys out there, maybe they did
fall in love. Maybe they really did wanna
get married and have kids and whatever-
the-fuck. But deep down? If they’re
honest? Real-honest? Lookin’ like a
family man’s more important than bein’
one.
42.
43.
GIRLIE
There are good men out there.
CLARK
Yeah... But they are very few and very
far... Much more than you would ever
wanna know.
GIRLIE
Women cheat, too.
CLARK
Different reasons. Women wanna feel sexy.
But they wanna feel sexy, ‘cause they
wanna feel wanted, and they wanna feel
wanted, ‘cause they wanna feel loved.
And, there it is - the “L” word again.
GIRLIE
That is just such bullshit. I am certain
there are plenty of women out there that
can cheat just like a fucking man!
CLARK
Sure, sure. There are women out there
that just wanna get fucked, no question.
But, those women... they don’t just fuck
any Joe Blow down the street. Nah. They
reserve their skills for men that have
money. Men who have power. Thus, causing
the whole world of men to want money and
power all the more. The suit, the house,
the car - we want those things, because
we want those skilled women to fuck us
senseless, like a man, no strings
attached. Therefore? You ladies fightin’
so hard to be our equal, is actually, in
essence, still reducing most of you to
nothin’ but toys. And so the cycle
continues.
GIRLIE
I seriously hate you right now. This is
everything that is wrong with the world.
Clark laughs.
CLARK
Look. At the end of the day, I do agree
with ya. Man or woman, people are people.
GIRLIE
Thank you.
43.
44.
CLARK
And people get lonely. Don’t matter the
reason. Humans just want a soft spot to
rest their heads. For an hour even... one
fuckin’ hour to forget yourself.
(after a thoughtful beat)
But... in your particular case...
GIRLIE
In my case... what?
CLARK
You mean it. You don’t use the “L” word
unless you mean it, do ya? And that puts
you in the “stereotypical category” as
much as it makes you hate me.
Silence.
CLARK
Look. I know you’re not “that girl,” all
right? I get it. I can tell. All the
little boys out there, they been chasin’
you. You don’t remember their names, you
don’t wanna cuddle, and you most
definitely don’t use the “L” word. You
wanna get in, get out, go home, take a
shower and sleep in your own bed. It’s
not about havin’ babies for you. It’s not
about bullshit. It’s about bein’
distracted. Just long enough that you can
forget about... whatever-the-fuck
happened in Gage, Oklahoma all those
years ago.
(a beat)
But then... one day... for whatever
reason... this guy grabs your attention.
And suddenly... you don’t know yourself.
Suddenly, you want things you never
fuckin’ wanted. Am I right?
No reply.
CLARK
Good news is... you’ll know right when it
happens next time, ‘cause you’ll actually
know what the fuck’s goin’ on. Won’t be
caught with your panties down on the next
round, sweetie. Unless you wanna be.
GIRLIE
Please just- Don’t say “panties.” Call
them literally anything else.
44.
45.
CLARK
Pantaloons, underwears-
GIRLIE
Great. Fantastic.
CLARK
Regardless... it will happen again.
Girlie looks instantly sick at the very thought.
CLARK
Oh, yeah. You’ll meet someone. Doesn’t
matter where. And the-uh, the
conversation’ll start to go a certain
way. Men know how to do that. Steer the
talk to see if there’s interest. When you
met your fella, he was doin’ the same
thing. He was pokin’ around to see if you
had any candy to give. And the answer,
clearly, was yes.
Girlie almost objects.
CLARK
Whether you knew it or not, you told him,
“Yeah, I got candy.” So, he kept pushin’
and pokin’ ‘til he got it. And there you
were, thinkin’ how great this guy is and
how nice he’s listenin’ and, oh, such a
perfect smile, so warm behind the eyes.
(a pause)
Bullshit. Bull-fuckin’-shit, sweetheart.
It wasn’t no accident. He’s done it
before, he’ll do it again. Ain’t nothin’
special about it.
(a declaration)
And now?!
With his right knee dramatically bouncing up and down,
Clark grabs an empty plastic bottle-
CLARK
I gotta piss like a fuckin’ racehorse.
He starts to unbutton his jeans.
GIRLIE
Oh-no- Do not do that in here!
CLARK
Fuck am I supposed to do?
45.
46.
GIRLIE
Take it outside!
CLARK
And get arrested?
GIRLIE
Who the fuck’s gonna arrest you? Come on,
Hell’s Kitchen, like you’ve never taken a
piss outside before.
Clark desperately glances around the gridlock. Then-
CLARK
Fuck.
With that, Clark jumps out of the cab and-
SLAM!
Behind her, the cars-
INT./EXT. NYC YELLOW CAB - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)
-Begin to HONK! The UNSEEN DRIVERS clearly upset that the
cabbie ahead of them has left his taxi unattended-
Girlie nervously glancing about-
HHHHOOOOOOOONNNNNNNKKKK!
But still no sign of Clark, when-
The lane to the right of the cab inches forward just
slightly, leaving a WHITE SEDAN parallel to Girlie.
There, one LITTLE GIRL, 5, in the back of the sedan
stares at Girlie from her carseat with large, dark,
fascinated eyes.
Girlie stares back.
The little girl’s beautiful Afro perfectly frames her
stunningly innocent face.
As if looking directly into her own childlike innocence
lost, Girlie swallows hard.
Then... she gives the girl a little wave.
46.
(MORE)
47.
In response, the little girl smiles at Girlie with bright
teeth and lifts a yellow FISH-SHAPED CRACKER in her
direction. A metaphor. Tightly framed for a strong beat.
The little lady giving Girlie one last powerful look-
Until- The white sedan inches forward a bit more...
stealing the little girl from GIRLIE’S POV. Leaving her
once again utterly alone.
And. There, in the dark, in the quiet, Girlie stares at
her phone... but does not unlock it. When-
CLIP! The driver’s door opens- Clark jumping back inside
and - SLAM!
Silence. A profound silence. That lingers longer than
expected. When- Quietly-
GIRLIE
He gave me his card.
CLARK
What?
Slowly, softly, that faint RINGING sound emerges again,
the sound that can be found deep within one’s ear.
GIRLIE
(barely audible)
He...
Suddenly. The RINGING stops.
GIRLIE
He gave me his card. He didn’t ask for my
number or anything.
CLARK
Well. There you go.
GIRLIE
No. That’s my point. He gave me his card
and I e-mailed him, not the other way
around.
CLARK
Uh-huh. Yeah. He’s good. I bet that man
gives out a shit ton of cards, wherever
he goes. It’s a numbers game. Sometimes
he gets the candy, sometimes he don’t.
But you better believe he’s dishing out
those cards like it’s fuckin’ ice cream.
And when you contacted him, sweetie, you
gave away your first piece of candy.
(MORE)
47.
CLARK (CONT’D)
48.
Can’t blame a guy for wantin’ more.
(after a pause)
Think about it. His card, it had a
business e-mail on it, am I right?
No reply.
CLARK
How long it take for him to switch you
over to somethin’... a little more
private?
Something starts to take hold in Girlie... a thought
that’s disturbing. Something she’s known. Deep down. But
didn’t want to know.
CLARK
Blink of a fuckin’ eye, am I right?
No reply.
CLARK
He wasn’t lookin’ for love, sweetheart.
He wasn’t lookin’ to replace his wife.
Who the hell wants to go to all that
trouble? Nah. He’s all set up, the way he
wants to be. He was just lookin’ for
another toy to play with. And clearly...
he found it.
(after a pause)
For all your smarts and all the time and
effort and everything you’ve clearly done
to make yourself a fuckin’ fortress...
somehow... you have found yourself back
in that bathtub again. Your hands and
legs all tied up. Fightin’ so hard to get
free.
Attempting to lighten the mood-
CLARK
One to two. I’m catchin’ up.
So over this conversation-
GIRLIE
(dryly)
Ya done yet?
CLARK
What?
She almost says the word, “Mansplaining.” But, instead,
decides to swallow that word like a jagged little pill.
CLARK (CONT’D)
48.
(MORE)
49.
GIRLIE
You have said very little, in a very long
time, that I didn’t already know.
CLARK
So...
GIRLIE
(simply)
So go fuck yourself.
With that, Girlie turns her gaze to the window again.
Clearly, he’s gone a bit too far.
Clark lets out a very soft EXHALE. And his own brow
furrows at himself.
CLARK
Listen... I run my mouth off sometimes...
That’s my problem. I like to push
buttons.
No reply.
CLARK
And stuff like this. It’s just somethin’
people don’t wanna talk about. Who
fuckin’ talks about this shit? No one.
Again. No reply.
With utmost sincerity, Clark turns again, half his face
slightly distorted from a few scratches embedded within
the plexiglass... the other half clear as day.
CLARK
Look... I can tell you’re a wonderful
person. A human. Askin’ my name and shit.
You got a good heart. I can see that.
Which is why... I just gotta tell ya
that... you’re better off just walkin’
away. (a beat)
And I say all this, not ‘cause I think
I’m smarter than you are, I’m sayin’ it
‘cause... I used to be that guy. Doin’
what your guy’s doin’. But now- I mean-
Honestly- The way you look right now...
that face of yours, all sad and shit...
it’s why I don’t go for the full candy no
more. (MORE)
49.
CLARK (CONT’D)
50.
I mean, I’ll take a blowjob now and
again, but- A lot of you girls these
days, you grow a conscience in the
mornin’, and I can’t deal with that no
more, I’m too old.
After only a beat, a slave to curiosity...
CLARK
Your guy young or old?
GIRLIE
(after a beat)
Old.
CLARK
How old?
GIRLIE
Old.
CLARK
Like what? Daddy-type shit?
Girlie pulls an old receipt from her purse and buries her
gum inside it.
GIRLIE
(after a pause, plainly)
He could be my father, yes.
CLARK
So... I’m guessin’ you don’t have a
daddy, right?
GIRLIE
I mean, I do, but-
CLARK
But you don’t have a daddy. And you
wanted him to be your daddy, am I right?
No reply.
CLARK
(after a long beat)
Ever call him “Daddy”?
Girlie forces another melancholy grin.
GIRLIE
(after a pause)
Two to two.
CLARK (CONT’D)
50.
51.
CLARK
We’re tied?
GIRLIE
We are tied.
CLARK
You call him “Daddy.”
GIRLIE
I do.
CLARK
That’s hot.
GIRLIE
It’s fucked up.
CLARK
Nothin’ fucked up about that. I mean... I
don’t know much about psychology or
whatnot, but it don’t take rocket-science
to know that you got a little girl inside
you. The little girl you used to be. She
didn’t go nowhere. And that little girl
didn’t have a daddy, but she still
fuckin’ needs a daddy, right?
(a pause)
So, you meet this guy, what, with his
bald head and liver spots - whatever the
hell he’s got goin’ on - would make most
girls your age wanna puke, but not you.
‘Cause he’s everything you missed out on
back in the day. He’s all the things your
friends had, but you didn’t fuckin’ have.
(a pause)
And now, years later, yeah, you meet this
older guy, and the little girl on the
inside, she just wants her daddy to hold
her, tell her nice things, read her
bedtime stories. But, the grown woman you
are on the outside wants, well... she
wants a different kinda bedtime story, if
you catch my drift. Put the two together,
and that guy gets a chance at havin’
somethin’ he would’ve never fuckin’
touched otherwise.
GIRLIE
(after a pause)
Me.
51.
52.
CLARK
You. (after a beat)
He’s a lucky son-of-a-bitch to have
gotten your candy, if you don’t mind my
sayin’.
Red and blue lights pulse on his face for a pause.
CLARK
He got kids?
GIRLIE
He does.
CLARK
How many?
GIRLIE
Three.
CLARK
Shit. How old?
GIRLIE
Young.
CLARK
How old?
No reply.
CLARK
Single digits?
GIRLIE
Single digits.
CLARK
His wife young?
GIRLIE
Nah, I think they just waited.
CLARK
Have you met her?
GIRLIE
No.
CLARK
You seen her?
52.
53.
GIRLIE
No.
CLARK
But you seen pictures.
No reply.
CLARK
Come on, this day and age? You wanna
picture, you can find a mothah-fuckin’
picture. Hell, for a little salt? You can
even find out where they live. Shit, the
last three places they’ve lived if you
set your mind to it.
GIRLIE
(after a beat)
Why do you care?
CLARK
Huh?
GIRLIE
Why do you care if he has kids or a wife
or any of it? What does it matter to you?
Clark sincerely weighs the question.
CLARK
I guess... I don’t know... Guess I’ve
always been curious. ‘Bout people. Gets
me into trouble, I’m not gonna lie. I got
a mouth on me, and I need to learn how to
zip it now and again, I do know that.
(a thoughtful beat)
I guess, I-uh... To be honest, I drive
this beast around and... can’t do much
else but think, ya know? And when you
think too much, you ask too many
questions. Nothin’ special about it.
(a pause)
But, hey, it ain’t all for nothin’, I
mean... who else you gonna talk to about
this shit?
(another pause)
Not like you’re ever gonna see me again.
Silence. A very weighted silence. Then-
GIRLIE
I found one picture of her. They’re
pretty private.
53.
54.
CLARK
They both in the picture?
GIRLIE
They’re at some corporate thing. Like an
award thing.
CLARK
What are they doin’? In the picture?
GIRLIE
They’re just... smiling. They’re sitting
next to each other and... they’re just...
smiling at the camera.
CLARK
And?
GIRLIE
And... they look... normal. They just
look normal.
CLARK
He win the award?
GIRLIE
He did.
CLARK
What, he some kinda big-shot or
somethin’? Someone I’d recognize?
GIRLIE
(softly, plainly)
Oh-yeah.
Silence. Then-
CLARK
How old is she? The wife?
GIRLIE
Late forties, I’d say.
CLARK
She pretty?
GIRLIE
(sincerely)
She looks really sweet.
CLARK
(a laugh)
So, she’s not pretty.
54.
55.
GIRLIE
She’s lovely. She has this huge smile,
like a really happy smile.
(a painful beat)
I looked at that photo for a long time.
It gave me this strange feeling like,
maybe... maybe she and I could have been
friends.
CLARK
(genuinely)
Yeah. Maybe. Another time, another place.
Maybe. (a beat)
Ever meet the kids?
GIRLIE
Oh-God-no.
CLARK
You find pictures?
GIRLIE
He shows me pictures.
CLARK
Fuck. Like on his phone?
GIRLIE
Yeah. Video, too.
CLARK
(actually surprised)
No kiddin’. That is some fuckin’ trust
right there. That is some real fuckin’
trust. (a thoughtful beat)
Huh.
GIRLIE
What?
CLARK
You did it.
GIRLIE
What did I do?
CLARK
I don’t know. But you did somethin’.
Girlie’s expression begs for Clark to explain further.
55.
56.
CLARK
He let you in. As far as anyone in your
position can possibly go.
GIRLIE
And what am I supposed to do with that?
CLARK
Look. It don’t change nothin’. But it is
a compliment.
Silence.
CLARK
The kids cute?
GIRLIE
They’re adorable.
CLARK
Boys? Girls?
GIRLIE
Twin boys and a girl.
CLARK
Huh.
GIRLIE
(after a beat)
He showed me this... this video of his
daughter, dancing. Three years old and...
she’s wearing this red cape. Like a
princess cape or something. And she’s
just... twirling and twirling.
CLARK
Dancin’ for her daddy. That’s sweet. You
ever dance like that for your daddy? Your
real daddy, I mean. When you were a kid?
GIRLIE
(simply)
No.
A beat. Then-
GIRLIE
I had a cape though. A long purple cape.
(after a pause)
Made me think I could fly.
CLARK
Cape wasn’t lyin’. You can fly just fine.
56.
57.
Another beat. Then-
GIRLIE
I still have it.
CLARK
What?
GIRLIE
My purple cape. It’s the only thing I
kept. From back then.
CLARK
Ever put it on?
GIRLIE
No.
CLARK
You should. Every once in a while.
GIRLIE
Yeah?
CLARK
Yeah. Why the fuck not?
GIRLIE
It’s under my bed. In a garbage bag.
CLARK
Pull that shit out, put that shit on, and
walk down the fuckin’ street. In this
town? No one’s gonna bat an eye.
Silence.
CLARK
So, what about the twins? What do they
do?
GIRLIE
They’re silly. They like to shake their
butts at the camera and say, “Nanny-Nanny-
boo-boo.”
CLARK
I thought it was “Nanna-Nanna-boo-boo”?
GIRLIE
I don’t know - they say, “Nanny-Nanny.”
57.
58.
CLARK
Guess it don’t matter either way. They’re
still gonna get a pop on the ass for
wavin’ it around.
The two chuckle lightly together.
CLARK
Nothin’ “Nanny” or “Nanna” can do ‘bout
it, am I right?
GIRLIE
Ah, they seem like good kids.
The two lock eyes.
CLARK
(with sincerity)
And you get the feelin’ you coulda been
friends. With the kids. Another time,
another place.
With a sad smile, Girlie simply nods. Another ocean wave
of true empathy crashing over Clark’s countenance.
CLARK
Yeah, well... He can pretend to be a
daddy to you... but he’s gotta be a real
daddy to them, so... you get why you
ain’t goin’ to Greece.
HONK, HONK!!
Startled, Clark turns and- Throws the cab in “D”-
Driving carefully beyond the FIRE TRUCK and two POLICE
CRUISERS-
The emergency lights pounding down even harder upon their
stark faces as they pass-
A wrecked car flipped upside-down and beaten to shit.
The horrific scene assuring both Girlie and Clark that...
someone lost their life tonight.
Right here. In this spot.
CLARK
Shit. That ain’t no fender bender.
Stoically, Girlie stares out the right windows as-
58.
59.
EXT. INTERSTATE 495 AND BEYOND - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)
-The cab carefully maneuvers around the RED and BLUE,
gifting us a glimpse of Clark and Girlie each gazing out
their windows with a reverent fear and awe of mortality,
their faces aglow from the fire of the red flares.
As the cab begins to pick up speed, the fixed street
lamps morph into shooting stars of passing light, the
HUUUUUUMMMMMMMM of rubber kissing asphalt beginning its
comforting song again.
INT. NYC YELLOW CAB - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)
Still rattled by the accident, Girlie and Clark both have
fallen silent.
And in this expansive, cold, perpetual loneliness...
Girlie stares at her phone.
And. Flips it over.
And. Unlocks it to find-
L (TEXT)

CLOSE ON GIRLIE. The phone illuminating her beautiful,
conflicted face.
She types a text... and sends.
GIRLIE (TEXT)
Still stuck in traffic
New dots immediately appear, not so surprising this time.
Clearly, “L” has been waiting.

At war with herself, Girlie locks her phone, with the
paranoia of a teenager afraid of being caught watching
porn.
She sits in silence, the wheels in her brain turning,
turning, turning.
HUUUUUUMMMMMMMMMMM - sings the rubber on asphalt.
Looking up, Girlie studies Clark who seems completely
lost in thought - his eyes on the dark road ahead, his
thumbs gently TAPPING on the steering wheel again.
Then.
Girlie opens “ALL PHOTOS”-
Scrolling through her “ALBUMS”-
Landing on a series of NAKED SELFIES she’s previously
taken in the privacy of her own apartment.
61.
62.
They are so fucking sexy, they are truly mind blowing.
Selecting her FAVORITE PHOTO-
Girlie takes to editing.
GIRLIE’S POV ON HER PHONE - Girlie ZOOMS IN on her soft,
young, gorgeous tits, cropping the photo.
She chooses a filter which darkens the image a bit, then
takes a screenshot of the photo to make it appear as if
it was just taken in the back of a cab, as marked by the
current day and time stamp.
Then-
With one last moment of hesitation-
She sends the photo to “L.”
And-
Within an instant-

REVERSE ON GIRLIE-
Impatient for her next fix- Waiting for a reply.
L (TEXT)

The screen suddenly goes dark as Girlie locks her phone.
Swallowing hard again, Girlie chokes back a wave of
emotion, her face hardening with her signature, militant
resolve. And-
62.
63.
CLARK (O.S.)
Eleven years... that’s a big difference.
Turning her head, Girlie faces Clark without the
slightest trace of weakness.
CLARK
Your sister. Bein’ that much older.
Internally rattled, taking a moment to reply-
GIRLIE
Yeah... she was only seventeen when we
both left home. I was six.
CLARK
You run away?
GIRLIE
I... went to live with her.
CLARK
Can’t imagine any Oklahoma judge sayin’
that was all right.
GIRLIE
No. No one said it was all right. But
that’s what happened.
CLARK
You live in the armpit? With your sister?
GIRLIE
We moved to Woodward, actually. About
twenty minutes away. Into her boyfriend’s
house.
CLARK
Boyfriend?
GIRLIE
She had boyfriends back then.
CLARK
Why’d you go live with your sister? Your
daddy do somethin’? Somethin’ he
shouldn’t have done?
GIRLIE
No, it was never like that.
CLARK
What was it like?
63.
64.
GIRLIE
(after a thoughtful beat)
He-uh... he actually... he never touched
me. He just... he never touched me.
CLARK
Not ever?
GIRLIE
It’s actually an easy thing to do, not
touch someone.
CLARK
Not one hug? Not once?
GIRLIE
It didn’t have to be a hug. Pat on the
back would have been nice. A fuckin’ high-
five.
Clark nods. He seems to greatly understand.
GIRLIE
(a thoughtful beat)
But... the day we left... I remember my
sister... jumped in her car and... my dad
was sitting on the porch.
Slowly, softly, that faint RINGING sound emerges again.
GIRLIE
And just before I left... I turned around
and... I looked at him. And he looked at
me. And then he... got up and walked over
to me... and he reached out... and he
shook my hand.
(a pained beat)
I’d never shaken anyone’s hand before, I
was six... I was just little, ya know...
The RINGING finally stops. Softly---
GIRLIE
But I knew what it meant.
CLARK
(after a beat)
What he look like? Your pop?
GIRLIE
Oh... he was a cowboy.
CLARK
Never met a cowboy before.
64.
(MORE)
65.
GIRLIE
You’ll know it when you see it.
CLARK
What? ‘Cause of the hat?
GIRLIE
You’ll know it when you see it.
CLARK
He have an accent?
GIRLIE
Oh, yeah.
(with a thick, Oklahoma
accent)
A real, real good’n.
CLARK
Huh. (after a beat)
Gonna put that on my list. You know,
before I die. Number twenty two: Meet a
mother fuckin’ cowboy.
Girlie glances at her phone, but fights away the
maddening temptation with-
GIRLIE
What else is on your list?
CLARK
Already done most of it.
GIRLIE
Like what?
CLARK
Like, I-uh... I learned how to scuba dive
last year. Took a trip to Nassau. Sat on
the edge of a boat and - they make you
fall backward, right? You fall back in
the water, and... start to let the air
outta your sails. And down, down, down
you go... I mean, I didn’t go too far.
Don’t have the trainin’ for the crazy
stuff - shipwrecks and whatnot. But I did
swim around this-uh, this mountain of
coral, what with all these little fuckin’
clownfish and angelfish and barracuda and
sponges and snapper and grouper.
(after a beat)
Saw a blue whale even. Yeah.
(MORE)
65.
CLARK (CONT’D)
(MORE)
66.
A big ass blue whale passed right by us,
not too far away, just swimmin’ along
like it was nothin’. Fuckin’ poetry, that
shit.
GIRLIE
Wow.
CLARK
Yeah, wow. That was a big fuckin’ WOW.
But... I don’t know if I’ll do it again.
GIRLIE
Why not?
CLARK
... Takes a lotta guts to breathe
underwater. That’s the biggest challenge.
Tellin’ your brain that it’s okay to
allow your body to do this thing it
wasn’t fuckin’ made to do. Had to take
ten minutes just to breathe calmly, you
know, in and out, in and out. Tellin’
myself I wasn’t gonna die. Tellin’ myself
I could always surface if shit went down.
Wasn’t afraid to see a shark, wasn’t
afraid to be left alone, was just...
mostly afraid of breathin’. And that. Is
some scary shit right there. Findin’
yourself afraid to breathe.
GIRLIE
(a thoughtful beat)
Always liked sharks. Did you see one?
CLARK
Nah. But I tell everyone I did.
(telling the story)
Great White. Thirteen feet long. Two,
three tons. Swims around me, lookin’ for
lunch. Until I look that fucker in the
eye and give him the middle finger. Just
like that, shark swims away. He knew
what’s what. Fuck, I love that story.
GIRLIE
What’s on your list that you haven’t
done?
CLARK
(a thoughtful beat)
I do wanna go to Japan one day. Heard a
lot about it.
CLARK (CONT’D)
(MORE)
66.
CLARK (CONT’D)
67.
Heard about how, in that culture, if
you’re drunk or if you’re a foreigner,
you’re forgiven for makin’ an ass of
yourself. And if you are both drunk and a
foreigner, all the more mercy is extended
your way. Which is great for me, ‘cause,
I love gettin’ shit-faced in a new city.
(a pause)
They also got these-uh, these vendin’
machines... with used bloomers in ‘em.
GIRLIE
Bloomers?
CLARK
Panties!
GIRLIE
C’mon, man, we’ve been over this!
CLARK
Well, I tried to call ‘em somethin’ else,
and you didn’t know what the fuck I was
talkin’ about!
(teasing, very loudly)
They got used girls’ panties!
GIRLIE
(teasing back)
Noooooo!
CLARK
Panties in vending machines! Least that’s
what I heard. And I gotta see that shit.
GIRLIE
They can’t really be used.
CLARK
I don’t give a fuck either way. It’ll be
mind over matter on that one.
Girlie cannot help but laugh.
CLARK
What about you, huh? What’s on your list?
GIRLIE
Oh... I don’t know.
CLARK
Come on. Talk to me.
CLARK (CONT’D)
67.
68.
GIRLIE
Well, I... guess... I have always wanted
to learn how to swing dance.
CLARK
Yeah?
GIRLIE
Yeah. Like get tossed around and stuff.
It looks like a lot of fun.
(a beat)
I think I’d be good at it.
CLARK
Bet you would.
SLOW ZOOM IN ON GIRLIE - The following monologue
delivered almost directly into the camera, as a
confession or admission.
GIRLIE
(laced with a sad longing)
And. I guess... I have been thinking
about having an herb garden in my
window... basil and stuff. And then. Try
to remember to use it when I’m cooking.
Which. Isn’t that often, but...
CLARK (O.S.)
What else?
GIRLIE
(a thoughtful beat)
I wanna be a freaky birdwatcher in
Central Park that knows about all the
birds. Someone that can recognize their
calls. I just wanna be a bird-lady... I
wanna learn how to play the ukulele, and
not be afraid to sing... even though I
can’t really sing... I wanna see virgin
rainforest before it disappears... some
place in Brazil, maybe... I wanna...
hablar español perfectamente and go to
Oaxaca during Noche de Rábanos and eat
all the things... I want to know Paris
and London and Rome and Berlin and
Barcelona like... they were my friends,
and, yes... I want to stand at the edge
of a fucking cliff in Greece... and dive
off that mother fucker.
ON CLARK.
68.
69.
CLARK
What else?
GIRLIE
(with a laugh)
What do you mean, what else, I just told
you so much.
CLARK
(laughing back)
What? Time for me to ante up?
GIRLIE
Damn straight.
CLARK
How many chips you got on the table?
GIRLIE
Two. We’re tied, remember? Two to two.
CLARK
And you raise me one?
GIRLIE
And it better be a good one.
CLARK
I give you a good one... you’ll match me?
GIRLIE
I’m not gonna let you win, that’s for
damn sure.
CLARK
All right, all right, I can hang.
Clark sincerely takes a moment to think, but-
GIRLIE
And it has to be something personal,
okay, not one of your little anecdotes.
CLARK
Well, fuck, I don’t know.
Coyly, Girlie leans closer, elbow perched on the open
window of the plexiglass, a playful smirk on her lips.
GIRLIE
Like... How’d you meet your wife?
CLARK
Which one?
69.
70.
GIRLIE
The first one.
Clark lightly chuckles at the memory...
CLARK’S POV THROUGH WINDSHIELD-
The white lines in the dark asphalt - the separation of
the lanes - guide the cab onward around a curve. Into the
darkness. The unknown. What it feels like to live a life.
INT. NYC YELLOW CAB, FRONT & BACK - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)
CLARK
She threw up in my cab.
GIRLIE
Classy.
CLARK
She was clubbin’ with her girlfriends.
Ladies’ night or some shit. They were all
in these tight dresses, and high heels,
and smelled like booze and sweat and...
flowers. Fuck. I was in Heaven. All these
pretty ladies, crammed in my cab, sittin’
on each other’s laps, talkin’ so loud,
laughin’ and screamin’ out the window,
askin’ me to turn up the music like some
disco ball was gonna drop from a fuckin’
moonroof. And, I gotta be honest - My
cock was so hard, just poundin’ in my
panties, ‘cause odds were, I was gettin’
lucky that night. And if I wasn’t lucky,
I’d have plenty of good material to rub
one out later, ya know?
GIRLIE
Riiight.
CLARK
And then, out of nowhere, blondie in the
back doubles over and empties out her
stomach. Which wasn’t holdin’ much, I am
thankful to report.
GIRLIE
What happened?
70.
71.
CLARK
Not much you can do. I drop ‘em off,
light the “Off Duty,” get back to the
garage, hose down the cab - and there it
was. Her purse. Right there on the floor.
(a beat)
Next day, she calls the company, gives an
address. And me, bein’ the gentleman that
I am... I offer to drop that shit off
myself, and-uh... didn’t have to jerk off
after payin’ her a visit, I can tell ya
that.
Sincerely needing to know, Girlie leans her head against
the side of the plexiglass window- Then-
GIRLIE
Why did you marry her?
CLARK
(softening)
Ah... she was a doll. Dumb as shit, but
still... she was a sweetheart.
(a beat)
Used to play pranks on her. You know,
hide behind the couch and jump out, put
sugar in the salt shaker, dumb shit like
that. And... she always laughed about it.
You know, she’d choose to laugh about it.
Like... when somethin’ happens and you
gotta choice. That choice to get pissed
off or the choice to laugh it off...
She’d laugh. She’d choose to laugh every
time.
GIRLIE
She ever get you?
CLARK
What? A prank?
GIRLIE
Yeah.
Recalling the memory for the first time in years-
CLARK
(a chuckle)
She did once. She-uh... she poured cold
water on me when I was takin’ a shower. A
bucket of ice water - Niagara Falls -
right down on top of me. And I had that
same choice, ya know. That choice whether
to get pissed off or to laugh it off.
71.
72.
GIRLIE
What did you choose?
Clark grins, his gaze softly focused on the Interstate
ahead, but his mind is elsewhere.
CLARK
I laughed my fuckin’ ass off. Chased her
‘round the house in my birthday suit. She
was screamin’ like a little girl, like we
were playin’ tag or some shit... Finally
caught her in the kitchen...
(a thoughtful pause)
That was a good day.
GIRLIE
I bet she’s a lot smarter than you give
her credit for.
No reply.
CLOSE ON GIRLIE. Still lingering in the plexiglass window-
GIRLIE
You miss her?
CLOSE ON CLARK. Weighing his feelings very carefully-
CLARK
I guess I do sometimes.
(a beat)
Yeah... She was like a summer day, you
know? Not too complicated. Just... a beer
and a bag of chips... and we were set.
(after a beat)
Three to two. You gonna match me or what?
Girlie draws a breath, but has no words-
CLARK
That last one’s a tough act to follow.
GIRLIE
Yeah, you surprised me there.
CLARK
Surprised myself, I don’t talk about my
shit!
GIRLIE
You think I talk about my shit?!
72.
73.
CLARK
So, there you go. That’s what’s on the
table.
CLARK
Let’s talk about shit. Let’s talk about
allll the shit!
GIRLIE
I’ll think of a good one.
CLARK
Easy. Make it about your daddy.
GIRLIE
(a chuckle)
Which one?
CLARK
You pick.
GIRLIE
Fuck.
Girlie retreats from the window with a dramatic sigh, now
reclined again in the backseat-
CLARK
Come on. There’s gotta be at least one
more thing you haven’t told me. Something
you are just dyin’ to say out loud.
(a beat, OFF GIRLIE)
Take your time. Not like I’m goin’
nowhere.
As Girlie sinks into the seat, her stare turns to the
window again- Where a SPRAWLING VISTA OF MANHATTAN
reveals itself. A spellbinding twinkling topography of
urban stars. Stars worthy to wish upon. An offering of
hope. Glittering across her somber expression.
EXT. INTERSTATE 495 - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)
TRACKING WITH THE CAB - the lights of Manhattan
shimmering closely in the background - we round a bend
and disappear into the darkness of the Queens Midtown
Tunnel, a passageway just under the flowing East River.
These two souls have literally just gone underwater.
73.
74.
INT./EXT. NYC YELLOW CAB / QUEENS MIDTOWN TUNNEL - NIGHT
This claustrophobic tube - covered wall to ceiling in off-
white tiling - bathes the cab in that same sickening
yellow cloud of toxic light pollution.
And there, in the yellowed dim, Girlie’s face falls...
making her look like a lost little girl... staring at the
small darkened TV screen before her. At her own black
mirrored reflection. Sitting in the back of a cab. Alone.
And... this imagine causes her to flip over her phone
again... and unlock it.
L (TEXT)

Twins woke up
CLOSE ON GIRLIE. Her face brightening at the mention of
the twins, a very genuine, maternal impulse.

Girlie looks like an anxious kid coming to the edge of a
very high diving board just before taking a brave leap.

ECU OF THE PHONE
Girlie drafts:
“But what does that mean? I don’t know what that means.”
But, she decides to delete this and-
Instead she writes, “Yeah?”
And sends.

Then, from the POV OF THE PHONE, looking up at Girlie
through the glass, we witness the next four words as they
are branded across her somber face...
L (TEXT)
(...)
love you too
ON GIRLIE. In shock. That last text reflected in her
eyes. She draws a soft INHALE.
Only to glance up, to find... Clark gazing at her in the
rearview with a look on his face revealing he knows
exactly who she’s been talking to. And, further still...
it seems as if he’s always known.
Owning it, Girlie doesn’t look away. They hold here,
sharing an entire conversation without saying one word.
Then-
EXT. EAST 37TH STREET - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)
-The cab emerges from the birthing canal of the Midtown
Tunnel into the bright bustle of Manhattan.
INT./EXT. NYC YELLOW CAB - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)
As they head west on 37th street across town - every
color of light gleefully bursts into the cab, dancing and
flirting and teasing away the shadows.
CLARK
Got a few more minutes, if you still
wanna play for the win.
A bit rattled, Girlie sits in silence.
CLARK
What’s left? What have you not told me?
77.
78.
Clark waits patiently as Girlie wrestles with something.
After a long beat-
GIRLIE
Last night... my sister and I...
CLOSE ON GIRLIE - The glaring lights of Manhattan have
demystified the details of this beauty, offering a
vulnerability unlike we’ve ever seen.
GIRLIE
We got drunk. We got really drunk. And.
We were sitting outside her trailer,
and... she has these little chili pepper
lights - like Christmas lights or
something - draped all around. And... we
sat there, in these old beach chairs, and
just... drank and drank.
CLARK
What about Eagle?
GIRLIE
She was grilling up some burgers.
A stoplight turns from green to red, forcing the cab to
halt...
CLARK
You talk about the bathtub?
GIRLIE
(with a laugh)
We did! I brought it up and she just...
laughed. She laughed so hard, she cried.
She didn’t apologize or anything- It was
amazing.
CLARK
What else ya talk about?
GIRLIE
Everything. We talked about the perms our
mom used to give us, sitting on a stool
in the kitchen, with this old pink towel
draped over our shoulders... That
smell... that perm smell... it’d stick
around for days.
Girlie swallows, hard.
CLOSE ON GIRLIE-
78.
79.
GIRLIE
And we start talking about that day...
the day she took me away. And I told my
side of the story. And she told her side.
INT./EXT. NYC YELLOW CAB - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)
The stoplight turns from red to green-
Clark continuing onward-
CLARK
What’d she tell ya?
ECU OF GIRLIE-
GIRLIE
She told me that... our dad was on the
porch that day. She told me that... we
passed him on our way to her car. And
then... she got in the car, and then, I
got in the car. And then... we just drove
away. (a beat)
She said that... he didn’t shake my hand
that day. But. When I think back on it,
it doesn’t make any sense, because... I
remember it so clearly... even the feel
of his hand... I remember thinking it
felt like sandpaper.
CLARK
And. So. Which of you is right? You or
your sister?
GIRLIE
(shaking her head, simply)
I don’t know.
(a pause)
But... if that memory isn’t real... the
moment my father finally touched me... I
don’t know what is...
CLARK
(a beat, quietly)
Ones and zeros.
GIRLIE
(quietly back)
Yeah... Ones and zeros.
Clark weighs his words carefully. Then, quietly-
79.
80.
CLARK
I got a story kinda like that... ‘bout my
pop. That moment when all the shit comes
into focus. Then goes back out again. But-
uh... that’s a whole other cab ride.
The two GAZE at one another in the review, sharing a deep
understanding without words.
GIRLIE
We’re tied again. Three to three.
CLARK
Three-all. Nice.
Breaking their gaze, Girlie looks out the window again,
the lights of the city kissing her face, until-
Another stoplight turning red, the cab halting again.
INT./EXT. NYC YELLOW CAB - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)
Girlie still gazing out the window.
The city lights etched upon her pensive face.
After a beat, the red stoplight turns green.
GIRLIE
We did a rain dance last night. The three
of us... just drunk... but Eagle, Eagle
showed us how.
CLARK
(after a beat)
Did it rain?
Her eyes gloss over as she fights back tears...
GIRLIE
That’s just the thing... Two weeks ago,
when I flew to Oklahoma...
With that same, stubborn resiliency, Girlie attempts to
swallow back this tidal wave of emotion, when...
All goes SILENT, as if the air has been sucked out of the
taxi again.
And there in the quiet, that gentle RINGING begins again.
RIIIIIIIINNNNNNNNG.
80.
81.
Until, finally, Girlie allows but one, small tear to
dance down her cheek.
The RINGING stops for one more breath of SILENCE.
Then-
GIRLIE
... I was pregnant.
CLOSE ON- Clark in the SIDE MIRROR- Taking this
information like a bullet to the chest.
CLARK
(after a beat, simply)
What’d your “daddy” have to say about
that?
GIRLIE
I never told him... I never told anyone.
CLARK
(a beat, carefully)
You... get rid of the baby?
A few more tears just barely escape Girlie’s eyes,
carving a small, thin salt stain down each cheek.
GIRLIE
It got rid of me... First day in
Oklahoma, I started bleeding.
(a beat)
My sister didn’t know. I just told her I
was having a bad period. Like a really
shitty period... She let me sleep a lot.
Gave me a heating pad and ice cream.
(a pause)
But... after seven days, when I kept
bleeding... I had to hide the tampons.
Pretend it was just a regular period that
ended... I had to get up and go out and
meet all her friends and eat fucking
barbecue and drink beer and go to a
Thunder game... feeling like trash.
(a beat)
I wasn’t going to keep it. I’d already
made up my mind. I wasn’t going to keep
it, and I wasn’t going to tell anyone.
And then... when it happened, when it
just... happened on its own... I was so
relieved, I’ve never been so relieved in
my life...
81.
82.
INT./EXT. NYC YELLOW CAB - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)
Clark gently turns right on 10th Ave, heading north.
GIRLIE
And then last night, when we were
dancing... in my mind... I really did, I
just begged the sky to rain down on me...
To clean me... to wash it all away... the
whole fucking thing.
Large pools of tears welling in her eyes-
GIRLIE
I asked the sky to just take it from me.
(a pause)
And then... this morning, when I woke
up... I wasn’t bleeding anymore. After
two weeks... it stopped.
CLARK
... Rain dance worked.
With one laugh through free-flowing tears, Girlie finally
allows the floodgates to open, the salt stains upon her
cheeks now healthy, necessary streams.
GIRLIE
Four to three.
CLARK
(softly)
Shit, I fold.
After a beat, lightly smiling through tears-
GIRLIE
I win?
CLARK
Can’t beat that, that’s for sure.
Leaning her head back, Girlie let’s out a soft EXHALE and-
The cab hits another red light, slowing to a stop.
Clark watching Girlie silently wipe the tears from her
eyes in the rearview, with ache- Wanting to say
something, anything of comfort, but not knowing how.
INT./EXT. NYC YELLOW CAB - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)
The red light turning green- Clark turns right on 44th-
82.
83.
When-
CLARK
Sorry, sweetie, uh... not quite sure
where to stop.
Immediately, pulling herself together-
GIRLIE
Oh, uh- It’s the-uh, the brownstone-
Right up there on the left.
INT./EXT. NYC YELLOW CAB - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)
Pulling up to the curb, Clark puts the taxi in “P,” as
Girlie pulls a wallet from her purse.
GIRLIE
I don’t have any cash.
CLARK
No one ever does.
GIRLIE
I’m sorry, but-
She pulls out a credit card.
GIRLIE
I’ll leave you a big tip though.
CLARK
(good humored)
Yeah, my advice don’t come free.
She swipes her card, prompting the little screen in the
back to spring to life again, gifting Girlie the option
to leave a ten, fifteen or twenty percent tip.
CLARK
You gonna need a receipt?
GIRLIE
Nah, I’m good.
With that, Clark POPS open the trunk, jumps out of the
cab and SLAM!
Behind her, the trunk lifts open as Clark rescues her
rolling bag.
Unbeknownst to Clark, Girlie presses an “optional tip”
button which reads - “CUSTOM.”
83.
84.
EXT. 44TH, BETWEEN 9TH AND 10TH - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)
One sturdy, black ankle-boot plants onto the trampled,
black-gum speckled sidewalk as Girlie assuredly lifts
herself from the yellow taxicab.
She shuts the back door - WHAM!
The trunk still ajar, Clark places the rolling luggage
carefully next to Girlie.
Normally, he’d slam the trunk closed, but instead...
The two stand, facing one another for the very first
time, granting a new perspective. And it’s caught them
both off guard. As if in a dream.
GIRLIE
So...
CLARK
So... (after a beat)
You gonna be all right?
GIRLIE
(after a thoughtful beat,
simply)
I don’t know.
CLARK
Listen... Your brain... it’s just
confused right now. It’s in a panic,
‘cause it ain’t used to breathin’
underwater. It’s gonna try to tell ya
that you’re in way over your head, that
this is it for you, no gettin’ out,
you’re done, end of story... But you
just... just keep on breathin’, all
right? No matter how far down you go...
you just keep on breathin’. ‘Cause
someone like you, you are not a
shipwreck. You’re gonna be all right.
You’re gonna... swim yourself back up
again... back to all that life and light
and color... Might even see a blue whale.
Girlie forces a vibrant smile through forming tears.
GIRLIE
I hope so...
Then. Slowly, gently, Clark holds out his hand, offering
a handshake.
84.
85.
You can see it in his eyes, that he means this as a
sincere offering, a way of attempting to make Girlie’s
false memory of her father right somehow. However he can.
So touched by this... Girlie reaches out her hand. But
instead. Gently places it on Clark’s cheek, cupping his
face with it, looking deeply into his eyes.
GIRLIE
(with utmost sincerity)
Thank you.
CLARK
(sincerely back)
You are... most welcome.
They share a moment of quiet, neither knowing how to say
goodbye. Finally... Girlie withdraws her touch.
GIRLIE
Have a good night.
CLARK
You too.
Then. Taking her rolling bag, Girlie begins to walk away.
Yet, unable to help himself, Clark calls after her.
CLARK
Mikey.
Girlie stops, turning to him once more.
GIRLIE
What?
The two stand, their feet planted a distance away from
one another, though they seem only inches apart.
CLARK
I always... sorta... felt like a Mikey.
Not a Vinnie. Not a Clark. If it were up
to me... I’d choose Mikey.
Deeply touched by this, Girlie’s tears give way to a
grateful grin.
GIRLIE
Four to four.
CLARK
I have met my match.
85.
86.
GIRLIE
You play a good game.
CLARK
You too.
They smile at one another in another suspended moment of
stillness. Then---
CLARK
You, uh... you live alone?
GIRLIE
(with a gentle grin)
You’re not getting any candy.
With a playful shrug-
CLARK
Can’t blame a guy for tryin’.
GIRLIE
(sweetly)
Goodnight, Mikey.
Clark watches Girlie head toward her building, not
looking back, her luggage trailing behind her reinstated
New York strut.
CLARK
Yeah, you take care of yourself, girlie.
And.
With that.
Clark slams the trunk tightly shut.
WHAM!
BLACKOUT.
CREDITS.
86.
