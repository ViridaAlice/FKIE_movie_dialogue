Black Screen. Orchestral music begins to play by Elena 
Kats-Chernin (famous Australian classical composer). 
Camera slowly pulls out of a black hole to reveal the 
wrinkled mouth and face of a very old woman, PINKY. She is 
lying in a bed covered in a snail patterned quilt. Beside 
her on a chair sits, GRACE, a woman in her late twenties 
wearing an odd looking handknitted hat with protruding 
pipecleaner antennas. Pingpong eyeballs are stuck on the 
ends. She holds Pinky's hand and looks deeply concerned. 
Pinky's breathing falters as her eyelids begin to close. 
There is silence. Suddenly her eyes pop open. 
PINKY 
(delirious) 
The Potatoes! 
Grace leans in closer and looks confused. 
GRACE 
Potatoes? ... Pinky ... what do you 
mean? 
Pinky freezes, exhales, turns her head and dies. Grace bows 
her head as a tear rolls down her cheek. 
GRACE 
(whispered) 
Oh ... Pinky. 
Fade to black. Title to film fades on in handwriting : 
MEMOIR OF A SNAIL. Fades off. 
Cut to Grace sitting on a bench in a lush vegetable garden. 
She is wearing her handknitted snail hat and some gumboots. 
Under her arm she is holding an urn containing Pinky’s 
ashes. A gold plaque reads : R.I.P. Pinky - Holding Angels’ 
Hands. 
Nearby a handpainted sign stuck in the dirt reads : Pinky’s 
Pitypit. Grace looks at the urn pensively. She takes the 
lid off and sprinkles Pinky’s ashes amongst the vegetables. 
GRACE 
Farewell Pinky.

Tears roll from her eyes as she picks up a jar of live 
snails. One of the snails has SYLVIA, painted on its shell. 
She opens the jar. The snails crawl out and slowly begin to 
escape. 
GRACE 
(whispering to the snails) 
Be free guys ... be free Sylvia ... 
She picks up Sylvia and lets her glide along her finger one 
last time. She brings her closer to her tear soaked face. 
Her sobbing subsides. She begins talking to the snail. 
GRACE 
Don't worry, I'll be ok ... I wasn’t 
always this alone ... (reflects) ... my 
childhood was full of people. 
CUT BACK TO PAST. 
Flashback to Grace as a child. Closeup on her face. Her 
eyes are closed and she has a dreamy smile. 
GRACE 
Dad used to say that childhood was like 
being drunk ... everyone remembers what 
you did ... except you! 
Her eyes open and she begins to examine her environment. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
But my childhood was sobering, 
Sylvia ... I remember everything ... 
right from the get-go. 
The camera widens to reveal Grace is inside her mother’s 
womb next to her twin brother, GILBERT. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
I’d always liked feeling caged in ... 
snug and protected. 
Grace seems content, while Gilbert looks eager to escape. 
Suddenly Grace disappears from the womb with a pop.

GRACE (V.O.) 
It was a shock to be born premature ... 
Cut to Grace as a new born baby in a crib. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
... I wasn’t fully baked ... 
Closeup on her lip. She has a cleft palate between her lip 
and nose that resembles a rabbit’s mouth. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
... and looked like a baby rabbit. 
She looks startled and vulnerable. Her eyes dart looking 
for her brother and mother. At the top of her crib a label 
tells her full name : Grace Prudence Pudel (pronounced 
Puddle). A nurse places Gilbert next to her in the crib. He 
is slightly bigger and healthier. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
I was named Grace Prudence Pudel ... my 
twin ... brother ... Gilbert. 
Grace smiles at her brother’s arrival. They are wearing 
matching tiny teeshirts. One says : Double. The other : 
Trouble. Closeup on their freckles. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
The nurse said we had two souls but one 
heart ... I liked that. 
Cut to Grace’s mother’s headstone : RIP Annie Pudel 1950 - 
1972. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
Our birth was very strenuous for 
mum ... we left her womb ... she 
entered her tomb. 
A snail is sitting atop of the headstone and is wriggling 
slightly. It suddenly stops, retreats into its shell, dies, 
and rolls off to the ground below. It leaves behind a pile 
of eggs. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
Mother snails did the same after they’d 
had their babies.

Cut to Grace aged five. Close up on her face. She is pale 
and wheezing heavily. She is having an asthma attack. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
As I grew older I suffered a 
smorgasbord of afflictions ... and was 
always back in hospital for something. 
A hand enters the screen and inserts an asthma pump into 
her mouth. She looks bewildered. It sprays a burst of gas 
into her lungs. She inflates slightly. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
The doctors said I was like a china￾doll you could shatter with just a 
stare. 
The camera widens to reveal Grace lying on an operating 
table. There are multiple surgeons about to perform surgery 
on her cleft palate. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
Eventually they needed to fix my floppy 
lip. 
She looks scared as one of the surgeons approaches her face 
with a scalpel blade. Cut to black. 
Cut to an electronic heart rate monitor showing Grace’s 
pulse plummeting. The surgeon looks worried. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
Things went bad ... I lost so much 
blood I needed a transfusion. 
Cut to Gilbert age five, sitting on a chair outside the 
surgery. Suddenly he is approached by an anxious looking 
surgeon. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
The doctor asked Gilbert if he’d give 
me his. 
He sits quietly as the surgeons explain what he needs to 
do. Gilbert looks worried, but slowly nods his head. A tear 
runs down his face.

GRACE (V.O.) 
He said yes, even though he thought 
he’d have to die to save me. 
Cut to Gilbert attached to a tube draining blood from his 
arm. He looks pale and turns to one of the doctors. 
GILBERT 
How long before I die? 
The doctors and nurses look shocked. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
They quickly explained he wouldn’t 
die ... his body would make new blood. 
Gilbert looks relieved. The colour in Grace’s cheeks 
returns as the remainder of Gilbert’s blood flows into her 
veins. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
He became everyone’s hero that 
night ... especially mine. 
Grace looks at her brother and smiles with appreciation and 
reverence. 
Grace’s eyes widen as she looks up at her father. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
To cheer me up, Dad gave me Mum’s old 
jewellery box ... 
She opens the lid. An ornamental snail begins to spin to 
the tune : Alouette. Inside the box she pulls out a little 
family of porcelain ornamental snails : a mother, father, 
and two children. Grace’s eyes widen further and a huge 
smile spreads. She then reaches in and pulls out a large 
silver ring in the shape of a snail. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
... inside it had her snail collection 
and her ring ... She’d loved snails as 
well and had been a malacologist at the 
Melbourne Museum ...

She looks at the ring then gives it to Gilbert 
appreciatively. He puts it on his finger and smiles. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
... I thought Gilbert should have it. 
GILBERT 
(Bravely) 
I’m gonna wear this till the day I die, 
Gracie ... 
Fade to black. 
Fade up to a wideshot of the city of Melbourne, Australia. 
Housing commission apartments are silhouetted against a 
summer horizon as the sun sets. Bent tv antennas clutter 
the rooftops. On cramped balconies sit dehydrated 
potplants, dirty airconditioners, and a random birdcage 
with trapped cockatoo. We gently glide in through the 
window of one particular apartment. 
The camera begins tracking. On the mantlepiece sits an 
ornate jar filled with black jellybeans. On the walls are 
dusty glass scientific displays of small insect skeletons, 
dead butterflies, dried snail shells, and other museum type 
objects. Scattered throughout the room are piles of old 
books and various bits of camera and lighting equipment. 
There is a dented Bolex 16mm film camera, an old wooden 
tripod and rusty film lights. 
The camera keeps tracking to reveal Grace and Gilbert 
happily sitting and reading on either ends of a tattered 
couch. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
Despite my woes, Sylvia ... I believed 
in glasses half full and silver 
linings. 
Their haircuts look homemade and their clothes secondhand. 
Grace is wearing her knitted snail hat. In the background 
an old black and white tv is playing : The Two Ronnies. 
Gilbert reads : Lord of the Flies. Grace reads a science 
book : The Lifecycle Of The Snail by Thaddeus Williams. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
Our home was our sanctuary ... 
especially my bedroom.

Cut to Grace in her bedroom finishing a glass of milk. She 
looks innocent and gentle. Her room is neat and organised. 
She stands and stares dreamily at her shiny porcelain 
family of snails sitting on a shelf. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
Right angles brought me enormous 
comfort ... as did my snails. 
Her porcelain snails are all facing forward and are in 
perfect right angles to each other. Grace looks pleased 
with their arrangement. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
They were tangible memories of a mum I 
never met ... They were my friends ... 
Camera pulls wider to reveal more ornamental snails. These 
ones look slightly deformed and are handmade from modelling 
clay. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
... so I made more of them ... I knew 
they’d never leave me ... hurt me ... 
or die. 
Cut to Grace looking at a homeless man lying motionless in 
a rose garden. It is winter and his lips are blue. He looks 
deceased. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
I didn’t like people dying ... 
Suddenly he shifts his weight. Grace looks relieved. She 
leans down and covers him in an old bedspread. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
... I wanted to save people ... save 
the homeless ... my favourite was 
James. 
James looks snug and protected under the blanket. He begins 
to snore contently. She then lays tinsel and Christmas 
decorations over his shape.

GRACE (V.O.) 
One Christmas I covered him in 
decorations so he could feel some 
Christmas cheer. 
Grace looks happy and proud of herself. She takes some 
coins and teabags from her pocket and places them next to 
his drunken head. A whisky bottle can be seen protruding 
from his coat pocket. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
He loved tea. 
He wakes up and smiles at her in appreciation. As he sits 
up he quietly mumbles : 
JAMES 
Bless you. 
She blushes. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
He was once a magistrate ... but was 
defrocked for masturbating in the 
docks. 
Flashback to James as a magistrate hiding in an empty 
courtroom at night behind a wooden row of seats. Only the 
top of his head can be seen. His eyes dart. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
Back then I thought masturbation meant 
chewing your food thoroughly ... He 
once told me that ... masturbation was 
the thief of time.
Cut back to James covered in Christmas decorations. James 
realises a small snail is crawling on his bald head. He 
notices Grace is wearing a snail hat. He takes the snail 
gently off and gives it to her. Her eyes widen with 
delight. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
James gave me my first real snail ... 
your mum, Sylvia.

Cut to a jar containing Grace’s pet snail eating a bit of 
toast smeared with Vegemite. 
Cut back to Gilbert on the couch reading : Lord of the 
Flies. Closeup of his face. He is very handsome but has a 
black eye. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
While I was busy trying to save the 
world, Gilbert was trying to fight 
it ... he saw people as a threat.
Flashback to a group of boys circling and teasing Grace at 
school. Tears pour down her face. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
He became my warrior ... 
protector ... ... defender. 
She drops to the ground, rolls in a foetal ball and 
retreats into her imaginary shell. They begin to taunt. 
THUGS 
(Chanting) 
Rabbitface ... rabbitface ... 
rabbitface ... 
One of the boys grabs her snail hat and runs into the boys’ 
toilets. He hurls it into the urinals. Gilbert arrives to 
defend her. 
GILBERT 
(Angrily) 
Hey fuckers! 
Gilbert and the boy begin fighting. Gilbert gets punched in 
the face and his tooth flies out. Gilbert grabs one of the 
thug’s fingers and breaks it backwards. A loud crack is 
heard. The thug runs off screaming. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
I wasn’t brave like Gilbert ... I 
retreated into my shell. 
Gilbert pants as blood trickles from his mouth, nose and 
eye. Grace picks up his bloody tooth. Closeup of the tooth 
in her palm. She gives it back to him. He shoves the tooth 
back into its socket and smiles at her in appreciation.

Cut to Gilbert standing by himself on their apartment 
balcony watching the sunset. He looks pensive. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
Despite his courage he was often 
sad ... seemed like he had a secret he 
wanted to tell ... His glass was half 
empty ... He was like Holden Caulfield, 
James Dean, and Charlie Brown all 
rolled into one. 
Closeup on Gilbert’s beautiful eyes looking at the horizon. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
He wanted to break free ... 
Suddenly a caged cockatoo screeches from the balcony next 
door. The cage has a nametag, MILDRED. Gilbert’s expression 
turns to anger. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
... free others ... 
He climbs onto the neighbour’s balcony and lets the bird 
out of its cage. It is hesitant at first to escape. 
GILBERT 
(Frustrated at bird) 
Fly! ... FLY DAMN YOU! ... Go! 
It suddenly launches from the balcony and flies into the 
distance screeching with joy. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
... rescue things. 
Cut to Grace standing beside a busy road. She looks anxious 
as she spots a snail trying to cross. It has made it half 
way. Gilbert arrives, runs onto the road and rescues the 
snail. He gives it to her and she sighs in relief. 
Cut to Grace and Gilbert putting the rescued snail into her 
jar with the other snail given by James. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
Gilbert loved animals as well ... and 
even became a vegetarian.

The two snails begin to mate. Gilbert and Grace watch with 
wonder. Closeup on the snail jar. Time lapse as little 
clumps of snail eggs appear, baby snails hatch out and the 
family grows. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
We created our own little families. 
Jumpcut to Grace painting Sylvia’s name on her shell with a 
felt-tipped marker pen. The swirl on Sylvia’s shell rotates 
in an opposite direction to the other snails. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
You became my favourite, Sylvia ... 
your swirl went opposite to the 
others ... 
Cut to a closeup of a book : The Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
Gilbert named you after Mum’s favourite 
author. 
Cut to Gilbert gazing at one of the candles on his birthday 
cake. Closeup on the flame. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
But the thing that made Gilbert really 
unique ... was his love of fire ... he 
wanted to eat it! 
He is mesmerised. Suddenly he lurches forward and eats the 
flame. 
Cut to Gilbert playing alone in his bedroom. On his desk he 
has lined a row of matches like dominoes that leads to a 
small firecracker. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
He’d spend hours playing with it ... 
inventing tricks ... 
He lights the first match and the chain reaction begins. 
Cut to black and the sound of an explosion. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
... he always smelt like burnt matches.

Cut back to Gilbert post-explosion. His face is sooty and 
there is smoke all around. He turns to the audience and 
smiles. 
Cut to Gilbert by himself in the playground on a bench 
reading : Catcher in the Rye. Girls nearby stare at him 
adoringly. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
At school the girls swooned ... He was 
the flame ... they were the moths ... 
Gilbert pays them no attention. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
... but he was more interested in his 
magic ... I think he just wanted to 
disappear ... 
Cut to Gilbert inside Bert’s Magic Shop. It is dingy and 
decrepit. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
... and spend all his pocketmoney at 
Berts’s. 
Bert sits behind the cash register smoking a cigarette. He 
is wearing a stained singlet with ash spilling down his 
front. Gilbert walks over to the counter to purchase a 
large packet of sparklers. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
Bert was the type of person parents 
told you to avoid ... someone who might 
offer you boiled lollies. 
Cut to a shelf in the back room of Bert’s shop. It is full 
of various bongs and smoking paraphernalia. Cut to a 
wideshot of Bert’s Magic Shop at night. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
Bert's seemed anything but magical. 
Flash forward twenty years to a fantasy scene of Gilbert as 
a handsome bohemian adult. He is a street performer in 
Paris and is breathing fire. A handpainted sign near his 
feet says : The Amazing Gilbert Pudel

GRACE (V.O.) 
Gilbert’s dream was to be a street 
performer in Paris. 
Crowds applaud. Match dissolve back to Gilbert as a child. 
He is in the same fire breathing pose. He grips all the 
sparklers he bought from Bert's. In his other hand he 
ignites a cigarette lighter. Grace watches him nervously 
from the sidelines. His face and arms are covered in 
bandaids. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
He was always practising ... and often 
burnt himself ... 
He puts the lighter to the heads of the sparklers. They 
burst into a massive ball of flames and singe his hair and 
eyelashes. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
... but pain didn’t bother him ... nor 
fear. 
Sparks fly everywhere. Grace screams. Gilbert and Grace get 
covered in the burning embers that rain down on them. 
Jumpcut to a closeup of Gilbert and Grace’s scars on their 
forearms. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
We got little scars and when we put our 
arms together .... 
They align their arms. The scars form a smiley face. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
... they formed a face. 
They look at their arms and giggle. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
It felt great when we did this. Our 
feelings aligned ...

it’s true. I felt his emotions ... his 
happiness ... 
CUT BACK TO PAST. 
Flashback to her childhood and a closeup of a framed photo 
sitting on a little table under the glow of a lamp. It is 
of a beautiful happy woman, their mother. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
... and his sadness ... which seemed to 
be the fourth member of our family. 
Their mother has freckles and raven black hair like her 
children. On the photo is written : Annie xo. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
Mum’s death had left a hole. 
The camera focus shifts to their father in a wheelchair 
sitting nearby. He is overweight and snoring deeply. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
Dad had tried to fill the void ... 
Closeup on his withered bent legs. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
... but he had his own problems. 
He holds the novel : Of Mice and Men. As he snores his 
mouth gapes. A dead cigarette hangs from his lips. 
Cut to a clip of an old 16mm scratched black and white 
animated film of a plasticine character walking along a 
street made out of cardboard. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
He was French and had once been a 
street performer and an animator in 
Paris ... he made stopmotion films with 
an old Bolex camera ... He showed them 
to us sometimes.

The shot widens to show Percy and his children watching the 
film projected onto a white bed sheet pinned to their 
loungeroom wall. An old noisy 16mm projector whirrs behind 
them. They giggle at the animated character. 
Flashback to their father as a street performer on a 
Parisian sidewalk. The Eiffel tower can be seen on the 
horizon. A little sign perched against the wall reads : The 
Amazing Percy Pudel. He juggles six pingpong balls with his 
mouth in-between puffs from his cigarette. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
Mum met him on a holiday she’d won in 
the Woman’s Weekly Magazine. 
Grace’s mother stands nearby watching in awe. She is 
dressed like a tourist with a Box-Brownie camera hanging 
around her neck. She has printed snails all over her dress. 
She takes a photo of him. Percy spots her and winks, then 
draws on his cigarette and blows her a smoke ring in the 
shape of a heart. He looks at her snail decorated dress, 
smiles and then mutters to her in French. 
PERCY 
Bonjour petite dame d’escargot. 
(Subtitles - Hello little snail lady) 
She blushes. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
They fell in love and he followed her 
back to Australia. 
The scene morphs to him juggling outside the Flinders 
Street Train Station (or Luna Park) in Melbourne. A small 
crowd watches and applauds. Suddenly the screech of a car’s 
breaks are heard. The crowd disperses. Percy still juggles 
with his head pointed upwards. He does not see the car 
hurtling towards him. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
But his career was soon ended by a 
drunkdriver. 
The screen goes black as the sound of the car hitting 
Percy’s body is heard.

window at birds flying in the distance. 
GRACE (V.O.)

Empty bottles of Bailey's Irish Cream Liqueur slowly 
dissolve in around the base of his wheelchair. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
... just like the guy who’d hit him. 
Closeup of Percy’s bloodshot eyes as he looks at the framed 
photo of his wife. Tears well. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
He was never an angry drunk ... just a 
sad one ... Money had always been a 
problem ... much worse since his 
accident. 
Closeup of the battery that powers his wheelchair. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
His pension barely paid for his 
batteries ... Winning scratchies was 
the only thing that brought him 
hope ... 
Cut to a screwed up scratchie stuck into the soil of a pot￾plant. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
... we found them everywhere. 
Cut back to Percy at home asleep in his wheelchair snoring

look relieved and go back to their reading. Fade to black. 
Fade up to Percy, Grace, and Gilbert out on the street 
attempting to jumpstart the battery on Percy's wheelchair. 
Gilbert is crouched beside a nearby car he has secretly 
attached very long jumper-leads to. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
Despite our hardships our little family 
unit was strong ... 
Gilbert yells out. 
GILBERT (Off camera) 
Ready! 
Percy pushes the starter button on his wheelchair and it 
bursts into life. Gilbert and Grace jump onto the back of 
the wheelchair as it zooms off down the street. 
GRACE (V.O.)

rollercoaster and amusement centre. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
Our happiest day was when we went on 
The Big Dipper. 
Cut to Gilbert, Grace, and Percy, slowly ascending The Big 
Dipper rollercoaster. They are sitting in the back carriage 
which rattles and shakes. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
It was scary ... scary because it was a 
hundred years old and might collapse. 
The train pauses then plummets down the slope. They scream 
happily. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
Dad felt alive ... escaped his body. 
Jumpcut to the three of them on the ground looking back at 
the rollercoaster silhouetted against the horizon. Closeup

GRACE (V.O.) 
When he died, he said he wanted his 
ashes sprinkled off The Big Dipper. 
Jumpcut to Percy in a bubble-bath later that night. Gilbert 
and Grace are scrubbing him with big sponges. Percy smokes 
a cigarette while scratching a pile of scratchies. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
The day got even better on the way home 
when Gilbert found a scratchie on the 
ground ... We won twenty dollars ... so 
Dad bought twenty more. 
Percy scratches the final scratchie and then sighs. Closeup 
of the twenty losing scratchy tickets on the bathroom 
floor. He looks slightly humiliated as his children 
continue to scrub him. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
He hated we had to look after him ... 
Cut to Percy after his bath wearing striped pyjamas while 
drinking Baileys in his wheelchair. He is looking out their 
loungeroom window at birds flying freely in the distance as 
the sun sets. He looks pensive. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
... his body was his cage ... his glass 
wasn’t full or empty ... just a glass. 
Percy stops looking out the window. His mood changes and he 
wheels himself over to an ornate jar of black Aniseed 
jellybeans. He smiles as he pops a jellybean into his mouth 
and then begins knitting a scarf. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
Knitting and black jellybeans were his 
other addictions ... We didn’t like 
them but he loved them ... an acquired 
taste, he’d say. 
Cut to Grace watching her father knit. She is still wearing 
her snail hat.

balls. 
Cut to Percy asleep in his wheelchair. His tongue is 
hanging out and is all black from the jellybeans. Gilbert 
and Grace smell his breath. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
The jellybeans made his tongue all 
black ... his breath aniseedy. 
They start placing jellybeans on his bald head while he is 
asleep. They form various shapes : a love-heart, a flower, 
and a pair of boobs. A wry smile creeps across Percy’s 
face. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
We arranged them on his head while he 
pretended to be asleep ... He let us do 
stuff like that ... never told us off. 
Cut to Gilbert and Grace taking turns at licking a nine 
volt battery and getting zapped. Cut to Gilbert supergluing

GRACE (V.O.) 
That night we got out Mum’s jewellery 
box and sang our heads off. Dad got 
really drunk. 
Gilbert, Grace, and Percy sing along loudly. Percy is 
happily drunk. 
GILBERT GRACE PERCY

Alouette, gentile Alouette, Alouette Je 
te plumerai la tête, Je te plumerai la 
tête ... 
Cut to Gilbert, Grace, and Percy making a stopmotion 
animated film on their kitchen table. The old Bolex camera 
sits on a wooden tripod. They are animating Grace’s clay 
snails frame by frame. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
Later Dad got out his Bolex and taught 
me more tips on how to animate ... I 
wanted to become an animator just like 
him. 
Cut to all three of them quietly reading with new 
hairstyles. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
To top the night off we had a 
competition to see who could create the 
worst hairdo ... 
Gilbert’s hair is tied up in a man-bun, Percy’s combover 
has been plastered into the shape of a snail swirl, and 
Grace’s hair is shaped like Princess Leia’s. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
... I won. 
Gilbert is reading : Kafka’s The Hunger Artist. Percy reads 
: The Grapes of Wrath. Grace reads : Memoir of a Geisha. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
Before bed we wound down by reading. I 
liked memoirs ... stories that weren’t

Grace looks directly at the audience and then turns back to 
her book. As Percy reads he leans over and takes another 
jellybean from the jar. It clinks. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
I remember the stillness that night ... 
the wonderful memories of that day ... 
fresh in our heads ... 
Wideshot of all three reading. In the background the tv 
plays : The Two Ronnies. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
... a day so precious ... 
Long fade to black. 
GRACE (V.O.)

There is a long pause of black silence. 
Cut to an abrupt extreme closeup of Grace’s face. She looks 
frantic and distressed. Loud clapping sounds can be heard. 
Cut to Percy in his wheelchair. He is motionless, mouth 
wide open. Gilbert and Grace stand next to him clapping 
vigorously. They look extremely worried as Percy is not 
waking up as he usually does. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
Despite our clapping ... this time dad 
never woke. 
Percy is still clutching : The Grapes of Wrath. Tears roll 
down Gilbert and Grace's faces. Fade to black and silence. 
Fade up to Grace in her bedroom packing a small suitcase of 
her belongings. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
We couldn’t afford a proper funeral, so 
Dad was cremated by the government ... 
his ashes given to us in a cardboard 
box.

She has taped a handwritten label to the jar that reads : 
R.I.P. Percy Pudel, an ace Dad. 
Cut back to Grace packing her suitcase. She looks forlorn 
as she carefully puts her father’s jellybean jar inside the 
suitcase next to his Bolex camera. She crams as many snails 
in as she can. The last thing she puts in is her mother’s 
porcelain snails wrapped in tissues. As she exits her 
bedroom she looks back for one final look. 
Jumpcut to Grace and Gilbert being escorted out of their 
home by a government child services officer. They get into 
an elevator. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
We were sent to foster homes ... in 
separate states. 
Grace and Gilbert’s heads hang low as the elevator doors 
slam shut. 
Cut to Grace and Gilbert standing near the door of an old 
Greyhound bus. Nearby stands the government official. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
We had no relatives, and no one wanted 
to adopt twins ... especially weird 
ones like us. 
Grace is wearing her snail hat. From her suitcase she 
produces her mother’s jewellery box and gives it to 
Gilbert. He looks at it and hugs her lovingly. Her head is 
nestled in the crevice of his neck. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
That was last time I saw my brother ... 
the last time I smelt his scent of 
burnt matches. 
Gilbert climbs aboard and sits in the back seat. He looks 
out the window at Grace while holding the jewellery box. He 
waves goodbye as a tear rolls down his cheek. On his finger 
is their mother’s snail ring. The bus chugs off over the 
horizon. Gentle thunder rumbles. Grace waves sadly. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
We never got to sprinkle Dad off The 
Big Dipper.

CUT BACK TO THE PRESENT. 
Adult Grace is still sitting on the ground in Pinky’s 
Pitypit talking to Sylvia who is now sliding towards some 
vegetables. There are smaller painted signs scattered in 
the garden indicating various vegetables : pumpkins, 
carrots, etc. Grace sighs as her thoughts are brought back 
to the present. She looks over to Sylvia. 
GRACE 
Our lives were turned upside down and 
back to front, Sylvia. 
Close up of Sylvia slowly moving forward. 
GRACE 
We had no choice but to move 
onwards ... upwards ... sidewards. 
CUT BACK TO THE PAST.

tree. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
I suppose, settled, is the wrong word. 
Traumatised was more accurate ... 
Cut to Grace standing inside her new bedroom gazing at her 
snail collection. She seems unsettled. The Bolex camera 
sits next to her jar of live snails and Percy’s urn of 
ashes. 
GRACE (V.O.)

Gilbert made me anxious ... 
Closeup of the snail jar. 
GRACE (V.O.)

me some comfort, Sylvia. 
Cut to Grace sitting at a kitchen table with her new foster 
parents. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
My new foster parents, Ian and Narelle, 
were pleasant enough.

and drinking glasses of milk. Ian and Narelle are dressed 
in cream coloured tracksuits. Narelle has frizzy ponytails 
while Ian is bald with a thick groomed moustache and beard. 
They have toothy smiles, generic looking and quite 
pollyanna. They watch Grace staring at her food. Grace 
forces an appreciative smile. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
They were accountants for a company 
that made traffic lights.

and look at her sympathetically. They hand her a 
certificate they have made : Award for Bravest Girl - Grace 
Pudel. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
They were well meaning and addicted to 
self help books. They believed a good 
dose of self esteem cured everything. 
Grace tries to look appreciative. Cut to more certificates 
plastered all over her bedroom wall : Award for Trying, 
Award for Biggest Smile, Award for Participating. 
GRACE (V.O.)

cream. 
Grace waves goodbye as her foster parents leave from the 
front door into the night. They are wearing matching 
skivvies and leather slacks. Narelle is wearing blue 
eyeshadow and Ian has waxed his moustache. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
On Saturdays they went to key-parties 
and did something called swinging. 
Cut to Ian and Narelle at a swingers party. Couples sit in 
orgy attire sipping elaborate cocktails on white couches. 
Eyes dart salaciously. 
Cut to Grace at school sitting in a classroom looking out 
the window to the playground and a giant tyre swing. 
GRACE (V.O.)

something else. 
Suddenly she is shaken out of her daydream. 
TEACHER

She begins reading one of Gilbert’s letters. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
I missed Gilbert like crazy ... 
It is written on a piece of paper with a logo at the top 
that reads : Garden of Eden Apple Orchards. Match dissolve 
the apple logo to a real apple sitting in a fruit bowl on a 
table in a bland looking room in Gilbert’s new home. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
... we wrote each other letters and I 
saved every cent I could to go see him. 
The room is minimal except for a few religious icons 
attached to the walls. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
He’d been sent to live with a family of 
fruit farmers in Perth. 
On the wall is a framed plaque : The Baby Jesus is 
Watching. Underneath is a picture of Jesus in the manger. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
I definitely got the better family ... 
he hated his. 
The family have their heads bowed and eyes closed. They 
begin praying in tongues (nonsensical prayer language).

humourless. Ruth has a bulbous nose and a single tight 
braid of hair down her side. Owen has a white manicured 
beard but no moustache. Closeup of Owen’s mouth speaking in 
tongues. Gilbert stares at him, bewildered by his 
gibberish.

GILBERT (V.O.) 
We all have to have magnets taped to us

balanced ... protects us from the 
devil.

On the table she is erasing graffitied drawings from human

She has enormous round glasses. She is smoking a cuban 
cigar and is wearing a man’s brown corduroy jacket with 
leather elbowpads. Her ankle high trousers are made of 
corduroy as well. She has stripey socks and wears black 
tapshoes. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
She clothed herself in corduroy and her 
face had more wrinkles than her

She loved to bake gingerhashmen ... She 
said they relieved her arthritis. 
Cut to Pinky working in her garden. She is wearing an

of vegetables, palms, exotic plants, and flowers. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
She also enjoyed gardening ... 
especially when she felt a bit blue. 
Closeup of the Pinky’s Pitypit sign stuck in the ground. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
She called it her pitypit ... 
PINKY 
Gardening fixes everything!

sprinkled in her pitypit ... be 
returned to nature ... fertilise her 
veggies.

course Pinky has built in her backyard. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
She also enjoyed minigolf ... and had 
built her own course. 
Pinky takes a wild swing and hits the golfball into a tree 
trunk. It bounces and ricochets off various objects : a 
watering can, birdbox, bucket, clothesline, Pinky’s 
forehead, etc. It finally lands in an old toilet bowl Pinky 
has painted red. 
PINKY 
(Excited) 
Hole in one!

GRACE (V.O.) 
But the thing that made Pinky truly 
remarkable ... was what she did every 
Monday. 
Cut to inside the home. Pinky is sitting beside a very old 
and frail woman. She holds her hand silently. The frail 
woman smiles appreciatively. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
She’d visit the lonely and hold their 
hands ... she said the thing the 
elderly craved most ... was human touch 
... They were often treated as if they 
had a disease ... 
Close up of their hands. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
She’d sit with them calmly in 
silence ... something so simple ... yet 
so comforting. 
Pinky looks left then right to see if anyone is watching. 
She slides her hand into her handbag and pulls out a 
gingerhashmen. The old woman’s eyes light up and she smiles 
cheekily. Pinky breaks off a leg and feeds it to her. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
An occasional gingerhashman helped as 
well.

backyard. Close up of Pinky’s frail and wrinkled hands

her own parent’s hands ... she never 
said why ... her childhood was off 
limits. 
Pinky pauses, turns her head and looks Grace straight in 
the eyes.

PINKY 
(Wisely) 
Life isn’t about looking backwards, 
Gracie, it’s about living forwards. 
Pinky is wearing colourful clothing whilst Grace is wearing 
black and grey. Pinky takes another wild swing and 
successfully putts the golfball into a miniature castle 
made out of old toilet roll tubes. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
She was the jewel in the Canberra 
junkheap ... she had crammed so much 
into her life ... 
The camera slowly cranes up over the top of Pinky’s 
eccentric backyard. The wind gently whistles through the 
foliage. Grace attempts to putt the golfball into the 
gumboot but fails. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
... I had crammed so little. 
Closeup of the burn mark on Grace’s arm in the shape of a 
mouth. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
Pinky’s friendship helped ease my 
sadness, my feelings of loss ... She 
was the medicine I needed ... a vitamin 
for hope. 
Slow fade to black as Grace putts the golfball. It misses 
the hole and knocks the castle over. The sound of the wind 
fades to silence. Long interlude of silent black. 
CUT BACK TO THE PRESENT. 
Grace is still reflecting on her life to Sylvia the snail. 
She now seems less upset. Sylvia is still gliding away from 
Grace further into the vegetable patch.

GRACE (V.O.) 
Ian and Narelle still obsessed about my 
mental health and sent me to self help 
classes ... 
They each have a yellow smiley face sticker stuck to their 
chests. Grace has accidentally stuck hers upside down. 
GRACE (V.O.)

endorphins, free my radicals, balance 
my chakra and cleanse my third eye. 
A handsome male instructor stands in the middle of the 
group on a stool. Grace smiles up at him admiringly. He is 
wearing a badge : I’m Craig - Your Heart Healer. On a table 
nearby sit a pile of self help books for sale titled : You 
Are Your Own Hero. A pretty girl standing next to Grace 
looks up at Craig lovingly as well. She flutters her

myself from society ... 
Jumpcut to Grace standing next to Ian and Narelle’s

could get off. 
Cut to Grace gazing at herself in a large mirror while she

with her new hairstyle, whilst Grace stills looks 
undecided. Suddenly a young man driving past in a VW beetle 
hot-rod, stops, winds down his window and wolf whistles 
sarcastically at them. He laughs and then zooms off. Pinky 
yells at him angrily and gives him the finger. 
PINKY

Yer Fucker! 
Grace bursts into tears. Pinky turns to console her. 
PINKY 
There-there ... ignore him ... I think

His letters still gave me hope ... but 
he began to worry me ... I felt he 
wasn’t telling me everything. 
Camera widens to reveal Gilbert in the barn where he is 
supposed to be attaching stickers to apples on the conveyer 
belt. Instead he is staring at the photo he has attached to 
a wooden post. He has grown taller and more handsome and is 
now in his mid teens. He looks melancholic as he continues 
to gaze at the photo. 
GILBERT (V.O.) 
Dear Gracie ... life at the Garden of 
Eden ... is certainly no Garden of 
Eden. 
Nearby Ruth is watching his every move. She grows 
increasingly angry that he is not doing his job attaching 
the stickers to the apples. 
RUTH

Gilbert shakes from his daydream and begins to attach the 
stickers. 
GILBERT (V.O.) 
Ruth seems to have it in for me ... but 
I don’t give a stuff.

GRACE (V.O.) 
... milkshake station in my kitchen. 
The lights are dim, candles are lit, and romantic music 
plays in the background. Ken and Grace are sitting at the 
kitchen table eating cocktail frankfurts on the end of 
toothpicks. The remaining guinea pigs watch curiously. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
We dated for a month ... 
Ken squeezes tomato sauce from a plastic squeeze-bottle and 
begins writing something onto his plate. He finishes and 
passes it to her. Closeup of the plate : Will You Marry Me? 
GRACE (V.O.) 
... and then he proposed. 
Grace looks surprised and delighted. Ken hands her one of 
the cocktail frankfurts on the end of a toothpick. Around 
the middle is an engagement ring. Grace screams with joy. 
Ken slides the ring onto her finger. He begins to hand feed 
her more frankfurts. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
He said he really did love me ... loved 
my quirks ... we celebrated with 
milkshakes ... he said he'd make me 
something special ... 
Jumpcut to Ken making a milkshake. Ken reaches for one of 
Grace’s jars containing dead guinea pig ashes from the 
windowsill. He grabs the one labelled, Cinnamon, thinking 
it is real Cinnamon. He goes to sprinkle it into the 
milkshake. Grace looks over and shrieks in horror. 
GRACE 
Noooooooo! 
Ken looks bewildered by her reaction. Grace quickly 
explains. Ken registers, then laughs at the absurdity of 
the situation.

GRACE (V.O.) 
But I wasn’t too disappointed ... 
They have set up a camera on a tripod to take a self

hoard. They put on cheesy smiles as the camera flashes and 
whites out the screen briefly.

handsome. He still has magnets taped to his biceps. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
Ken gave him money for an airfare to

She continues to stand on the coffee table as she realises 
the letter is postmarked from Perth. She quickly opens it. 
A huge smile spreads across her face. She begins to read. 
RUTH (V.O.) 
Dear Grace. This is Ruth, Gilbert’s 
foster mother. 
Grace’s smile begins to fade. There is a long pause. 
RUTH (V.O.) 
It saddens me to tell you that Gilbert 
has died in a horrific fire ... Our 
church burnt down and he was unable to 
escape the flames. 
Grace’s expression turns to horror. 
RUTH (V.O.) 
Last week I found Gilbert and my son 
Ben ... fornicating.
Flashback to Gilbert and Ben kissing behind the church. 
Ruth is spying on them from behind a nearby tree. She is 
horrified and screams. 
RUTH 
LUCIFER!

I’m sure you will agree ... the only 
course of action was to purge and 
correct their sickness in the correct 
fashion as instructed by the Lord our 
Saviour.

heavenward. 
RUTH (V.O.) 
This was not a simple task ... we could 
not just pray-the-gay-away ... and saw 
the only recourse being a dual 
expulsion to cast the demons out ... 
Gilbert and Ben look terrified. All the other brothers look 
eager for the ceremony to begin. Ruth has a determined look 
on her face. 
RUTH (V.O.)

The rest of the family begin speaking in tongues as well.

Owen turns the battery on. He adjusts the current with a 
knob and begins to electrocute them both. Ben and Gilbert 
shake and twitch in pain, their teeth clenched. They are 
covered in sweat and look disturbed. Owen turns the knob 
further and increases the current. Ben starts to shriek and 
cry uncontrollably. Owen stops the treatment. 
RUTH (V.O.) 
I am glad to say for my son ... this 
was a success ... 
Gilbert looks stoic and slowly becomes more and more 
enraged. He looks at Ruth with intense hatred. 
RUTH (V.O.)

would not vacate.

Ruth ducks as Gilbert flies over her and smashes into an 
apple-crate. The brothers surround Gilbert and clench their 
fists. He looks terrified as they advance on him. Still 
tied to the post, Ben suddenly yells out. 
BEN 
(pretending) 
Look! An angel! 
The family all stop advancing on Gilbert and look to see 
where the angel is. While they are distracted, Gilbert gets 
to his feet and runs from the barn. On his way out he spots 
a jerrycan of lawnmower fuel and grabs it. 
Cut to Gilbert running to the church as tears stream down 
his cheeks. He runs inside and slams the door shut behind 
him. 
RUTH (V.O.) 
He then raced to our church ... 
He splashes the fuel all over the altar, pews, walls and 
floor. 
RUTH (V.O.) 
... set it alight ... 
He unknowingly splashes petrol on his arm. He throws a 
match and the altar erupts into flames. The flames seem 
much greater than he anticipated and the fire spreads 
rapidly. Gilbert looks horrified as the flames surround him 
and suddenly leap onto his arms. He screams.

Ruth and the rest of the family arrive to see the church 
now fully ablaze. Gilbert’s horrific screams can be heard 
from inside. Ben watches in dismay. Ruth is indifferent and 
relieved. They seem reluctant to rescue Gilbert from the 
inferno. 
RUTH (V.O.) 
We tried to rescue him ... but the 
inferno was too intense ... the good 
Lord took his soul ... and Lucifer lost 
the battle. 
Jumpcut to the family having a memorial for Gilbert amongst 
the apple trees during the day. Ruth is apathetic and 
expressionless. Owen reads from a bible and is speaking in

God and the Baby Jesus.

bark, howl, and cry. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
Losing a twin is like losing an eye,

I no longer believed in silver linings 
or glasses half full ... my glass was

snails ... real ones hoarded together 
when threatened ... survival in 
numbers. 
The camera tracks to her jar of real snails all clumped 
together asleep. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
I was their protector and they were 
mine ... they sheltered me from the 
real world ... 
The camera tracks over to Grace sitting upright in her bed. 
She is motionless and stares into the dark. She seems 
almost camouflaged amongst her hoard. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
I blended into them ... they 
camouflaged me .... made me 
invisible ... Grief is strange ... 
tears don’t flow ... they’re too scared

spoonfulls of love kept me going ... 
Ken enters the room, sits beside her and begins feeding her 
cocktail frankfurts and sips from an enormous milkshake. 
Closeup of Grace’s dry, lifeless, and bloodshot eyes. 
The camera continues to track around the room analysing her 
hoard as her monologue continues. 
GRACE (V.O.)

my real family ... I had an emotional 
attachment to every one of them ... 
they loved me when no one else 
would ... they were loyal and I was 
loyal back ... and for this I suffered 
the consequences ... my hoarding was a 
destructive cycle without logic ... 
that was both its beauty and lunacy ...

I feared making the wrong decisions ...

body stoops in shame and resignation.

Eventually I got caught ... the shame 
was crushing ...

her an envelope. She opens it and starts reading. Aerial

looks curious. 
Jumpcut to Grace in her nightgown out of bed near the 
wardrobe. She is standing on a tiny wooden stool that looks 
like it is about to collapse under her. The guinea pig is 
chewing on a large scrapbook. She reaches for the scrapbook 
and begins looking through it. She starts to look shocked. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
... and horror. 
Closeup of the pages in the scrapbook as she flicks through 
it. We see a chart tracking Grace’s weight, then various 
photos taken of her asleep that show her gradual weight 
gains. Another page has various weight gain recipes. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
It seemed Ken’s onion did have 
layers ... he didn’t love me ... he 
loved my fat ... he had some sort of 
feeder fetish ... his plan was to 
fatten me up for his own delights. He 
didn’t want to fix my bowl ... he 
wanted to fill it and fill it and fill 
it ... with lard. 
Flashback to Ken making Grace a milkshake. Into a glass 
blender full of icecream and milk he drops lumps of duck 
fat and then blends them altogether. He smiles with 
satisfaction. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
It was one thing for me to create a 
cage for myself, it was another for 
someone else to imprison me ... I knew 
he admired my chunkiness ... but this 
was something more ... he wanted to 
immobilise me ... make me dependent ... 
exploit my vulnerabilities for his own 
sick pleasure ... he said he’d love me 
more the bigger I got ... and I 
stupidly believed him ... what an idiot 
I was ...

Cut to Ken outside Grace's house on the footpath with his 
packed suitcases. Grace looks at him angrily from her 
bedroom window. He looks back at her and bows his head in 
shame. She slides open her window and angrily throws his 
glass blender at him. It smashes all over the ground. She 
throws his Kintsugi bowls as well. They shatter into 
thousands of golden pieces. Grace slams the window shut, 
closes the curtains and then bursts into tears. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
I don’t remember much after that ... I 
was punchdrunk. 
Cut back to Ken walking in shame down the street. He

eating her. She screams and wakes from the dream. 
GRACE

She realises it was just a dream and sighs. She turns her 
head and looks at her photo of Gilbert and her as children. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
I loathed myself ... was full of shame 
and regret ... My hoarding had caused 
this ... I loved my snails, but the 
money I’d wasted could have bought a
dozen plane tickets to see Gilbert ... 
Now he was dead ... and I hated myself. 
Fade to black. 
Grace's P.O.V. Her eyes open to find Pinky with a tray 
holding a small glass of prune juice and an apple. The sun 
begins to shine through the window. Grace looks at Pinky 
and smiles at her in appreciation. Pinky holds her hand. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
Pinky put me on a strict diet. Life 
became slightly bearable as the days 
flowed and I slowly emerged from my 
darkness. 
Grace looks at Pinky’s very wrinkled hand which is 
trembling from arthritis. She then looks at Pinky’s face. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
I began to notice how much Pinky had 
aged while my life had been in turmoil.

PINKY 
Did I tell you that thing I can't 
remember? That thing I was looking for 
but don't know what it is? ... Stupid 
brain! ... Stupid disease! ... What's 
the name of that German guy whose 
disease I got? ... Guggeinheimers? 
Grace holds her hand tightly and tries to calm her. 
GRACE 
Relax Pinky ... it doesn't matter. 
Pinky relaxes and then smiles. 
PINKY 
Ah Gracie, such a great friend. 
Grace holds her hand and smiles. Pinky’s breathing is 
uneven and shallow. Nearly all of her hair has fallen out. 
Classical music begins play. Pinky suddenly starts coughing 
more violently. Grace holds her hand more securely. Pinky 
acknowledges her kindness. The sun shines through the 
window onto her wrinkled face cushioned on the pillow. 
Grace looks concerned. Pinky’s breathing begins to falter. 
She looks towards Grace and gently squeezes her hand 
tighter. Her eyelids begin to close. There is silence. 
Suddenly her eyes pop open. Pinky finally remembers what 
she needs to tell Grace.

ashes. Sylvia the snail has almost crawled to the top of 
the garden stake sign. 
GRACE

Potatoes? Sylvia ... Potatoes? ... 
Maybe that’s what she wanted her last 
meal to be? ... god damn life .... such 
a stupid puzzle ... 
Grace sits silent for a few moments. All is still. Suddenly 
we hear her heartbeat. It is slow but gets louder and 
faster. Tiny sweat beads begin to appear on Grace’s 
forehead. Grace starts to get angry with herself. 
GRACE 
DAMN IT! 
The camera zooms in on her forehead and into her brain as a 
flashback montage of her life’s struggles and misfortunes 
begins : Ken, Gilbert, her father, her mother, her hoard. 
Dozens of disturbing images flash, blur, and accelerate 
into each other. It goes into a rapid cycle, faster and 
faster, more and more disturbing. It suddenly reaches a 
climax and stops. Grace screams into the air. 
GRACE

Ahhhhhhhhhh ... 
Grace sobs heavily into her hands. Long pause. 
GRACE

Grace pauses and looks down into her basket beside her 
feet. She leans down and takes out a box of poisoned snail

box for a moment then pours a handful of the poisoned 
pellets into her hand. She suddenly looks determined. 
She pauses, then puts the pellets into her mouth. There is 
silence as her swollen cheeks begin to redden and sweat. 
Tears roll from her eyes. Her face grows redder and redder 
as she stares at Sylvia who has now finally reached the top 
of the sign which is revealed to the audience for the first 
time : POTATOES. 
Grace’s cheeks go pale, her eyes begin to roll as her heart 
stops beating. She begins to die. Sylvia stops moving and 
then sadly turns her antenna-eyes back towards Grace as if 
trying to tell Grace something. Grace’s eyes suddenly widen 
in realisation. We hear Pinky’s final words. 
PINKY (V.O.) 
(ghostly echo) 
The Potatoes. 
Grace violently spits out the pellets and splutters. 
GRACE 
Potatoes ... The POTATOES! 
Grace starts digging furiously into the soil with her 
hands. One by one she pulls potatoes from the dirt. She 
digs deeper and deeper. A metal clunk is heard. She pulls 
out Pinky’s biscuit tin. Grace looks shocked and unsure. 
Fade to black. 
Grace stares at the biscuit tin for quite a while. She 
looks anxious. She gathers herself, takes a big breath and 
then opens it. Inside are rolls of cash, old black and 
white photos, and a large envelope labelled : To Grace. She 
opens it and starts reading. We hear Pinky’s ghostly 
voice : 
PINKY (V.O.)

secrets.

legs. Cut back to the present, Grace continues reading 
Pinky’s letter. 
PINKY (V.O.) 
Anyway, I digress ... My secrets ... 
Firstly, I’m an orphan ... and was 
raised in an orphanage after the Great 
War. It was a terrible place where I 
was kept alone, day and night ... 
Flashback to inside a squalid orphanage. Rows of rusty 
steel cots line the walls containing babies and neglected 
children. Closeup on Pinky as a small child in one of the 
cots. 
PINKY (V.O.) 
... never held or hugged ... 
Camera widens to reveal a little boy in the cot next to 
hers. He is sobbing. She stretches and reaches her 
malnourished arm through the bars of her cot and takes hold 
of his hand to comfort him. 
PINKY (V.O.) 
... the only contact, the little boy 
next to me. 
Cut back to present. Grace looks stunned.

PINKY (V.O.) 
I won’t tell you the horrors I 
remember, but do want to tell you what 
it’s like to feel imprisoned ... 
caged ... it was dreadful. 
Jumpcut to Grace standing in the middle of her hoard. 
PINKY (V.O.) 
But in the years since, I’ve learnt
that the worst cages are the ones we 
create for ourselves ... 
The camera revolves around Grace as she ponders Pinky’s 
words. 
PINKY (V.O.) 
... you have created a cage for 
yourself Gracie ... 
A semi transparent and superimposed veil of thousands of 
Grace’s snails slowly fade on between her face and the 
audience. 
PINKY (V.O.) 
... and the only way to escape is by 
overcoming your fears. Your cage has 
never been locked ... but your fears 
have kept you trapped. Get rid of those 
snails ... unshackle your mind forged 
manacles ... set yourself free. 
The superimposed veil of snails slowly fade off to leave 
Grace by herself.
PINKY (V.O.) 
There’ll be pain ... but that’s 
life ... you have to face it head 
on ... be brave. 
Closeup on Grace’s face. For the first time she looks 
determined, steely and prepped.
PINKY (V.O.) 
A bit of self pity is ok ... but it’s 
time to move on ... you got rid of 
that creepy Ken ... now seize life 
while you’re young.

Grace starts to look even more enlightened and determined.
PINKY (V.O.) 
Life is about striving for 
simplicity ... but it’s hard to 
achieve ... it’s a long process of 
distillation ... trial and error. It’s 
time for you to shed your shell ... 
purge your hoard ... start anew ... 
those snails you think are protecting 
you, are stopping you ... they’re a 
bandaid for your pain. 
Cut to Grace standing in Ian and Narelle’s backyard staring 
at her enormous hoard of snails piled metres high. She 
starts shovelling them into the smouldering incinerator. 
Flames begin to emerge from the top. 
PINKY (V.O.) 
Snails are considered lucky in many 
cultures ... they have brought you 
joy ... but in your case ... no luck. 
She then throws Ken’s feeder fetish scrapbook into the 
flames. She then takes off her snail beanie and considers 
throwing it into the flames as well. She changes her mind 
and puts it back on her head. The burning ashes float 
upwards into the Canberra sky. Grace looks into the sky and 
smiles. 
GRACE 
(whispered to self) 
Be free. 
Classical music is playing in the background. Transition to 
Grace standing in her now empty bedroom devoid of snails 
and clutter, the walls and shelves bare. She looks at peace 
with the world. She is holding a recent photo of Pinky 
looking very old and wrinkled. 
PINKY (V.O.) 
Anyway, I want to thank you Gracie ... 
You’ve been terrific ... Not long now 
til my number's up ... time to close my 
curtains ... For the first time in my 
life I feel older than I look ... and I 
look like a testicle.

Grace continues to smile as we hear the remainder of 
Pinky’s letter. 
PINKY (V.O.) 
Life’s a beautiful tapestry that needs 
to be experienced ... its small 
pleasures savoured ... 
Flashback to Pinky smoking a cigar in the rain. 
PINKY (V.O.) 
... like smoking a cigar in the 
rain ... 
Flashback to Pinky putting on a jumper which has come 
straight from her tumbledryer. 
PINKY (V.O.) 
... or wearing clothes straight from 
the dryer ... enough rambling, time for 
both of us to let go ... Like I’ve 
said, life can only be understood 
backwards, but we have to live it 
forwards ... snails never go back over 
their trails ... always moving 
forward ... 
Cut back to Grace standing in the middle of her bedroom. 
She goes over to her window and opens the curtains. 
PINKY (V.O.) 
... time for you to leave some 
glittering snail trails all over the 
world ... 
Grace looks out at the setting sun. 
PINKY (V.O.) 
... and remember ... never ... never go 
back. 
Slow fade to black. 
Fade up to Grace sitting in the docks of a court awaiting 
her verdict for shoplifting.

She looks nervous. The Magistrate walks into the courtroom 
and takes his seat. Grace looks up towards the bench. The 
magistrate is old and well groomed. 
MAGISTRATE 
(Loud and stern) 
Ms Pudel! 
Grace looks startled. The Magistrate looks at Grace without 
emotion. He looks at notes in front of him in relation to 
the case. The Magistrate looks serious as he ponders 
Grace’s case. 
MAGISTRATE 
Your crime is serious ... theft is 
theft, whether it be a diamond or a 
cucumber ... and if you forgive the fox 
for stealing your chickens, then he’ll 
steal your sheep. However ... 
His tone changes. 
MAGISTRATE 
... I can tell from your face you’re 
full of shame and regret ... and true 
regret is punishment enough ... you‘re 
a kind person ... Many years ago, a 
little girl showed me kindness when I 
was at my lowest ebb ... 
Quick flashback to a shot of the Homeless Man Grace assists 
at the beginning of the film. 
MAGISTRATE 
... that little girl gave me hope and 
courage ... to start again and escape 
my vices. 
Grace suddenly realises it is James the Homeless Man she 
gave money to as a child. 
JAMES 
(Smiling) 
You may have wandering hands Ms Pudel, 
but I know you have a heart of gold and 
have done many good deeds ... I 
therefore release you from your charges 
... case dismissed!

A smile spreads across his face as he bangs his gavel. 
Cut to Grace meeting with James outside the court. He holds 
her hand and then embraces her. 
Slow fade to black and complete silence. 
Handwritten text fades on : A Year Later. Fades off. 
Fade up to a sign : Canberra Film School. In brackets 
underneath : Caution - This Sign Has Sharp Edges. 
Cut to Grace in a stopmotion animation studio moving a 
little plasticine puppet of herself frame at a time. Her 
puppets and sets are poorly made yet endearing. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
Life had bashed me around a bit ... but 
the roses smelt better. I liked nature, 
despite what it had done to me ... and 
I finally started to become the person 
I’d always wanted. 
Cut to a handpainted sign stuck above the entrance to a run 
down Scout Hall : Canberra International Film Festival. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
I made a film about my life. 
Jumpcut to inside the hall and the final scene of her film. 
A plasticine Grace punches a plasticine Ken. The animation 
is amateurish and clunky. The credit roll begins : Written, 
Directed and Animated by Grace Pudel, Narrated by Edna 
Everage. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
It wasn’t very good, but a few people 
came and I even had a question and 
answer session afterwards. 
Grace is standing on stage as the credits to her film 
finish rolling. The lights come up and she is holding a 
microphone. 
GRACE 
(shyly) 
Any questions?

Cut to a shot of the audience. There are only handful of 
people. They look indifferent. Crickets chirp. Grace looks 
slightly disappointed and shrugs her shoulders. 
GRACE 
(shyly) 
Ah well ... thanks for coming. 
She turns to exit the stage. Suddenly a voice is heard. 
VOICE 
(Calm, dry, gruff) 
I’ve got one. 
Grace stops and peers into the darkened auditorium. She 
sees a dishevelled man’s hand slowly rise. The man looks 
sunburnt and his clothes shabby. He has a thick black beard 
and looks exhausted. He is smiling. 
VOICE 
Do you believe in Magic? 
Grace looks confused by the question. The voice continues : 
VOICE 
Did you ever wonder if your brother could have 
escaped those flames? 
Closeup of the man’s hand. On his finger is a snail shaped 
ring. Grace goes pale. 
GRACE 
(softly) 
Gilbert? 
He nods his head gently. 
GILBERT 
Yes ... I walked across that desert. 
Gilbert walks onto the stage and hugs his sister. The 
little scars on their arms align to form the smiley face. 
They embrace in silence. An anonymous lady in the second 
row claps with delight. 
Long fade to black.

Fade up to an exterior shot of Grace's home. It has been 
cleaned up and looks refreshed. Cut to inside where Grace 
and Gilbert are sitting on either ends of the couch. They 
are both quietly reading. Gilbert is now clean shaven. The 
thick burn marks on his arm from the church fire are more 
visible. Grace reads : The Diary of Anne Frank. Gilbert 
reads : The Ginger Chested Pirate. Grace stops for a moment 
and turns to stare at Gilbert, still shocked by his 
arrival. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
It took me a while to believe Gilbert 
was alive ... how he’d escaped the 
fire ... 
Flashback to Gilbert in the burning church. He climbs out 
the tiny window at the back of the church and escapes into 
the dark. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
... and how his ashes were nothing 
more, than ashes ... 
Cut back to them on the couch. Grace leans over to 
Gilbert's urn of ashes which has been converted into a 
container to hold black jellybeans. She takes one and 
begins eating it. 
Cut to Pinky's Pitypit and the potatoes sign Sylvia had 
alerted Grace to. On top of the sign is a small clump of 
snail eggs. Cut to the soil below. Sylvia's empty shell 
lies on its side. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
We were finally free of our cages ... 
and even though our family had shrunk a 
little ... 
Cut to Grace's mantlepiece. The jar which once contained 
Sylvia and all the other snails has now been converted in a 
flower vase. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
... we were together again ...

Camera keeps tracking along the mantlepiece to reveal the 
other collection of urns : the Guinea pigs', Pinky’s, and 
Percy’s. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
... with only one thing left to 
release. 
Zoom in on Percy's urn. 
Wideshot of Luna Park and The Big Dipper Rollercoaster 
silhouetted against the setting sun. The train slowly 
climbs the first slope. 
Closeup of the last carriage. Grace and Gilbert sit huddled 
together. Gilbert holds Grace’s hand. Grace is holding 
Percy’s urn of ashes. The train reaches the peak of the 
slope, hesitates, and then plummets downwards. Grace 
releases Percy’s ashes into the air. They form a swirl. 
Cut back to the wideshot of the rollercoaster silhouetted 
against the horizon. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
Gilbert still smelt like burnt 
matches ... The setting sun tingled our 
skin ... 
Camera tilts upwards into the darkening sky as the sun 
finally sets. 
GRACE (V.O.) 
... our two souls and single heart. 
Twinkly stars begin to appear. Slow fade to black. 
Orchestral music begins : A robust version of, Alouette 
begins to play. Credits Roll. THE END.
