      OVER BLACK:
The faint clicks of a LIGHTER.
A fuse crackles. Creak-thump-creak. Footsteps scurry
away...quiet.
EXT. MRS. MILLER’S HOUSE - DAY
...BOOM!
Through handheld, compressed, lo-fi video, we see a mailbox
explode, shattering the perfect calm of a tranquil suburb.
Scraps of wood and metal fly everywhere.
FAHAD MAHMOOD, 13, confident, cool, young Casanova (or-so-he￾thinks), and JIMMY KIM, 13, aka SOUP, a loose cannon of
untamed emotion, cackle as they run away.
The front door swings open. MRS. MILLER, 60s, curmudgeon-y
old lady, runs out and chases them.
MRS. MILLER
WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU KIDS DOING?
YOU’RE DRIVING ME INSANE. I’M GONNA
FUCKING GET YOU, COME BACK HERE!!!
FAHAD
(curse word in Urdu)
BAN CHOD!
Chaos through the lens. A total visual blur.
As they run, the filmer turns the camera around, revealing
CHRIS WANG, or WANG-WANG, 13, an observant, impressionable
brace-faced boy in search of an identity -- laughing,
yelling, fueled by adrenaline -
- and FREEZE on this image of Wang-Wang, blurry and happy. As
soon as it does, MUSIC BLASTS -- and we’re off.
INT. WANG-WANG’S HOUSE / VIVIAN’S BEDROOM - DAY
Wang-Wang cracks the door open and enters a disheveled
teenage wonderland. Piles of clothes and half-packed moving
boxes swallow the floor. BAND POSTERS plaster the walls
alongside wallet-prom photos and mall photoshoots.
In them, VIVIAN, 17, beaming, a lowkey scenester on the cusp
of adulthood, eager to leave behind this chapter of her life.
Wang-Wang rummages around as if it’s his room. OPENING
CREDITS accompany the following sequence:

      -He opens drawers - a cornucopia of random stuff: movie
stubs, empty red envelopes, a LIVESTRONG band! He takes it.
-He picks up a pair of GIRL JEANS. Wrangles himself into
them. Checks himself out in a FULL-SIZED mirror. Strikes a
few poses. Pretending to be hot and sexy -- just weird.
INT. WANG-WANG’S HOUSE / CHUNGSING’S BEDROOM - DAY
CLOSE on a series of PAINTINGS, mostly still life and clouds.
WIDE to reveal an artful mess, canvases and art pieces all
around. A makeshift studio in the corner of a bedroom.
CHUNGSING, early 50s, Wang-Wang’s mother and an empathetic,
artistic, but poorly-assimilated Taiwanese immigrant takes
off her smock and drapes it on her easel. She exits.
BACK IN VIVIAN’S BEDROOM
-Wang-Wang tech-decks off a stack of textbooks while a
YOUTUBE VIDEO of local skaters titled ‘510skateboading - FMT
locals.’ plays on Vivian’s computer screen.
In the video are: DONOVAN, 17, hometown hero, dirt-stained
clothes, shoelace-belt, NUGGET, 14, a happy-go-lucky skate
rat, and CORY, 16, unkempt, hella chill -- remember them.
INT. WANG-WANG’S HOUSE / KITCHEN - DAY
-A marked up Chinese Calendar with important appointments and
reminders hangs on the wall. Today’s date: July 28th, 2008.
-Chungsing dons an apron. Knots it tight around her waist.
-She prepares ingredients for dinner: chopping vegetables and
poultry; beating eggs; washing rice.
IN VIVIAN’S BEDROOM
-On the bed, Wang-Wang lies on his back, trying kick-ups.
Failing.
-Wang-Wang shuffles through Vivian’s iPod Nano, earbuds in. A
catalog of the alt-emo hits: Boys Like Girls, Cute Is What We
Aim For, Paramore, The Maine, The Starting Line. etc.
IN THE KITCHEN
-TSSSSS. Oil sizzles as Chungsing sautés the meat and
vegetables.

      -Chungsing sets up the dining table, Chinese newspaper
trivets and food mats of old magazines.
IN VIVIAN’S BEDROOM
-Wang-Wang spots a UCSD COLLEGE SWEATER on the floor.
Auditions it in front of him in the mirror. It’s a bit small,
but he likes it.
Then, through the mirror, the bedroom door SWINGS open.
VIVIAN

INT. WANG-WANG’S HOUSE / KITCHEN - NIGHT
A Chinese game show plays on the television.
Chungsing’s finished dishes sit steaming on the dinner table,
along with a mound of Zong Zi. Seated around are Chungsing,
NAI NAI, 80, Chungsing’s mother-in-law, a round ball of
energy and attitude, Vivian, exuding an air of angst opposite
from her wall photos -- her skin chapped with eczema patches
beneath her colorful PARAMORE band tee -- and Wang-Wang,
eating with a fork.
One seat remains noticeably empty.

NAI NAI

NAI NAI *
你太瘦了! 男孩需要多吃才能⻑肌⾁.
也才能變成⼀個(強壯)的男⼦漢呀!
CHUNGSING
[Nai Nai, don’t feed him. He
can grab it himself.]
CHUNGSING
奶奶. 不要餵他，他可以⾃⼰挾.

Beat. Shock. Quiet.

Chungsing strikes a look at Nai Nai, but holds her tongue.
Vivian gets up.
VIVIAN

You think you’re so cool, but

As she storms off, she swipes Wang-Wang’s beanie off his
head.

Wang-Wang rushes off after Vivian.

      INT. WANG-WANG’S HOUSE / BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER
Dual sinks. One cluttered with female toiletries, one not.
Wang-Wang rages in, past the sinks straight to the toilet.
Then, backtracks.
He scans the toiletries. Grabs Vivian’s LOTION. He unscrews
the top, pees a little bit in it. Screws the cap back on.
Shakes. Puts it back. Goes to toilet.
INT. WANG-WANG’S HOUSE / GARAGE - NIGHT
Wang-Wang skates, recording himself. We see all this from the
POV of his camera, resting on the ground.
He practices an ollie. Pop, slide, fall. Dozens of tries. A
few false successes -- lands on the board, slips out.
Sweatier and sweatier with each attempt.
Finally, he lands one. It’s sloppy, but a land is a land.
WANG-WANG
YES!!!
Just as he celebrates, Chungsing opens the garage door,
visible in the clip.
CHUNGSING
[You can’t exercise right

13-year olds of all different backgrounds parade around.
Cannonballs into the pool. Flipping in the JUMP HOUSE. Super

      As Wang-Wang steps behind Madi and a TEENAGE BOY, scanning
the assortment of snacks, the world reverts back to normal.
He just...stands there.
Seconds go by, feels like minutes, when Wang-Wang’s phone
finally rings and a recording of Madi’s Myspace song plays.
She doesn’t notice. Stuffs a mini hot dog in her mouth. Wang￾Wang inches closer...
GEORGIA (O.S.)

Wang-Wang watches her run off. He picks up the phone.

Why’d you ask me to call you.
INT. JADE’S HOUSE / LIVING ROOM - LATER
Around the house, kids play GUITAR HERO in one room, CHUBBY
BUNNY in the kitchen, some boys just sit around flapping
their cheeks together -- a very odd sight.
In the LIVING ROOM, Fahad commands the attention of a SMALL
CROWD seated around him with gusto.
As Fahad performs, Wang-Wang turns and spots Madi and
Georgia, joining the crowd. He stares, hoping she looks
back......nothing.
FAHAD
...so Hardeep starts pissing in the
river, and Wang-Wang starts filming
him, right? Then later that day, he
uploads it to YouTube and titles
it, Hardeep Pissing In The River,
and he sends it to us and we’re
like - yeah, that shit go. Then a
few days later, I get a call from

Everyone laughs, including Madi. Wang-Wang notices. He looks
up at Fahad -- animated, poised, emanating charm –-
everything he isn’t.
INT. JADE’S HOUSE / LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Everyone huddles together, watching the film SUPERBAD.
Wang-Wang is sandwiched between Jade & Fahad and Soup &
Ellie, both huddled together but definitely not cuddling.

Oh. I actually gotta go. Umm,

Chungsing sits in front of an easel, painting. She leans in

grazed by delicate brushstrokes. Finishing touches.
She dips her paintbrush in a jar of water, sits back and
looks at the work. Pleased. She smiles.

ON WANG-WANG’S COMPUTER SCREEN: a YouTube video titled “unco
same gets jacked” of a BUFF ASIAN MALE, late 20s, telling a
story about how he got jacked at a gas station. He feigns a
thick, stereotypical broken Asian accent, periodically
interrupted by “hood” language spoken in perfect english.
KNOCK KNOCK. Before Wang-Wang answers, the door cracks open.

CUT TO:

EXT. LONE TREE PARK - DAY
Summer in full swing. BOYS playing basketball; FAUX-DANCERS
filming themselves C-walk; a group of GIRLS taking photos on
their DIGITAL CAMERAS -- Madi is here.
Wang-Wang, Yan Yans in hand, runs up to a circle of boys,
mostly 13, going body shots -- a mini fight club. Some of
them are in post-practice LITTLE LEAGUE attire -- Soup and
Fahad included. Some wield their camera phones, recording.
Inside the circle are Soup and another boy, TYSHAWN, 13,
pounding on each other. Tyshawn lands a few good punches on
Soup, hands up on guard.
TYSHAWN
W’sup, mayn? Come on come on.
Then, all of a sudden, Soup goes APESHIT and starts swinging
uncontrollably, almost moshing. A human helicopter, but he
hits. PA-PA-PA-PA. Arm. Rib. Arm. Chest.
TYSHAWN (CONT’D)
OW. OKAY, OKAY.
Tyshawn retreats and resigns. The crowd of boys jeer. Soup
kneels next to Wang-Wang and Fahad.

enters the ring. Throws off his shirt.
COLIN

Wang-Wang, frozen.

Tyshawn jumps in as referee as Wang-Wang and Colin throw
their hands up. The crowd cheers.

OUR SEXY ASS WONDER BREAD WARRIOR,
COLIN TYLER. AND TO OUR LEFT,
CHRISTOPHER WANG, THE BOY WITH NO
PERSONALITY.
BOY (O.S.)
And a tiny Asian peepee!
The crowd laughs. The commotion draws some people over --
Wang-Wang sees Madi and her girl gang running over.
He locks eyes with Madi -- she shoots him a thumbs up.
TYSHAWN
FIGHT!
Colin, fists up, circles around. Wang-Wang follows. Gulps.

      Every step Colin takes toward Wang-Wang, he retreats a step.
His body touches the edge of the crowd. Colin closes
in...then Wang-Wang BOLTS to the other side. Cat and mouse.
Colin stretches his eyes back into slits. Cheap shots.
COLIN
OoOOh herro!!! Me so horny!
MADI
Go Wang-Wang!
Wang-Wang steals a glance at Madi, cheering...
He steps toward the middle...tries to SLAP Colin. Just barely
scratches his nose.
COLIN
NO FACE SHOTS.
WANG-WANG
Sorry, sorry. I’m so sorry.
SOUP
Chest and throat, Wang-Wang! Chest
and throat!
Wang-Wang keeps his guard up...eyes Colin up and down...
Then, he DROPS to the floor. Colin lets his guard down.
COLIN
Huh?
Then, immediately HOPS back up, drops again. Rolls.
Then, like a ninja, he LUNGES at Colin, tackling him and
wrangling him around -- their lanky bodies make it look like
a weird dry-hump. Everyone looks confused.
COLIN (CONT’D)
Bruh.
Colin wrestles Wang-Wang off him. As his grip slips off, Wang￾Wang, vision obstructed, BITES Colin on the nipple.
COLIN (CONT’D)
AHHHH.
CROWD
OHHH! HE JUST BIT HIS NIPPLE!
In a burst of adrenaline, he SHOVES Wang-Wang off him, then
aimlessly backhand swings -
- CLOCKING Wang-Wang in the eye.

Chungsing drapes the sweater on his chair. Before she leaves,

Among them:

August 22 - Vivian leaves home

of the skaters from the earlier YouTube videos -- skate past.
Wang-Wang watches as he disappears around the corner...
He turns. Chungsing and Vivian at the opposite end. Employees
busy. He stuffs the eraser in his pocket, leaves.
EXT. HILLTOP GIFTS - CONTINUOUS
Wang-Wang exits out of the store. From afar, he sees Donovan

He walks toward them, eyeing Donovan especially, enamored...

Enters password. Click. Click. YouTube.
He clicks through to his Channel, then to his Video Manager
where a list of previously uploaded videos appear.
He scrolls through them. We catch glimpses of video titles.
Some are obviously skate-related, but some have titles like
“shit piss” and “GAGANDEEP GUPTA PISSING IN THE RIVER.” They
all have <200 views, except the latter: a little over 20,000.
He opens a few of the random ones in new tabs. He clicks:
‘crazy white lady freakout’ -- the clip of them blowing up
Mrs. Miller’s mailbox and running away, screaming in elation,
set to metal.
‘fahad getting owned’ -- Soup looks directly into the lens,
shot on a shitty cell phone cam.
SOUP
Hi, I’m Jimmy Kim and welcome to
Jackass!
Soup turns and kicks Fahad in the nuts. He collapses,
laughing and groaning. Soup: thumbs up.
‘smoking a sticky note’ -- From a webcam POV, the three boys
huddle in front of a computer, Soup smoking what looks to be
a joint, but it’s just a STICKY NOTE FULL OF TISSUE PAPER.

Wu Tang this.
Wang-Wang grabs the faux-roach. He inhales...and then FOOMP --
inhales the rest of the paper down his throat. Swallows.
Coughing. They laugh.
Wang-Wang clicks back to the VIDEO MANAGER PAGE. Scrolls
down. Clicks the boxes next to those videos and a few others.
He flies back up the page. Moves the cursor to a button:

Wang-Wang’s a deer in the headlights. The backhandedness of

Thanks.
Their eyes meet. She smiles.
Then, she edges her arm closer toward Wang-Wang. And ever-so￾slightly, their hands touch. He notices. She notices.
A very long, awkward silence. Wang-Wang’s breathing pierces
the air. Madi inches her hand closer to Wang-Wang’s...

Wang-Wang shakes his head. Madi moves her hand up towards
Wang-Wang’s forearm.

Beat. His words land like a sharp dagger, not a friendly jab.
JADE / ELLIE / FAHAD
UMMM / Woah. / Dude.
WANG-WANG
Wait what. No, I’m kidding, i’m
just...i’m sorry. Hardeep called
you that at the - I thought that
was like a joke or nickname or
something?
ELLIE
You think my nickname is dumb
bitch?
Jade and Ellie: Unamused. Fahad’s face screams -- what are
you doing? So embarrassed.
EXT. GOLFLAND - EVENING
A beautiful blue hue. A MINIVAN pulls up outside.
JADE
There’s my mom.
Before they get in, Jade and Ellie glance at one another -- a
mental confirmation of sorts for something.
ELLIE
Ummm, some friends are coming over
right now to watch a movie...if you
wanna come.
FAHAD
Yeah, for sure.
JADE
There’s only room for one more in
the car though.

      FAHAD
Oh.
ELLIE
(to Wang-Wang)
Ummmm, if you want you can take the
bus and meet us there?
Wang-Wang turns to Fahad, hoping for a response like: “it’s
okay. We’ll take the bus home together.” But --
FAHAD
You cool with taking the bus?
Beat. Wang-Wang nods.
JADE
Cool. See ya there byeee.
Wang-Wang watches Jade, Ellie, and Fahad hop in the minivan.
He notices that after they all get seated, there’s still one
vacant seat left in the back.
ELLIE (O.S.)
Can we tell Soup to come?
Fahad pulls the door shut, but it’s one of those automatic
minivan doors. It stutters in place as he tries to close it.
Wang-Wang watches, just waiting for them to ditch him.
Fahad leaves the door alone. Looks at Wang-Wang. They share a
strained look.
The door glitches a few times, then very slowly shuts. Wang￾Wang watches as the car disappears out of the parking lot.
EXT. BUS STOP - NIGHT
Wang-Wang sits on a bench, waiting. Has been here a while...
He pulls out his phone. Dials someone...
INT. CHUNGSING’S CAR - NIGHT
The car coasts down the road. Chungsing drives as Wang-Wang
stares out the window, a sadness in his eyes.

CHUNGSING
你看起來有點難過. Are you sad?

[Okay. Just asking.]

[If you’re not fine you can

CHUNGSING
好啦，只是問⼀問.

如果你不OK你也可以告訴我.
Wang-Wang ignores her. He turns the car dial to an alt-rock
radio station to drown out the silence....
Chungsing turns the volume down.
Wang-Wang turns it back up...Chungsing turns it back down.
Wang-Wang turns it back up. From the steering wheel, she
turns it down.
WANG-WANG
MOM.
CHUNGSING
[I can’t focus on driving
when it’s so loud.]
CHUNGSING
這麼⼤聲，我不能專⼼開⾞啦!
Sigh. A long silence. They drive. It’s tense. Wang-Wang
stares out the window.
Then........a sniff.
WANG-WANG

CHUNGSING
Hmm?
WANG-WANG

CHUNGSING
好啦!也許我有，我也不知道.
WANG-WANG
IT SMELLS LIKE SHIT.
CHUNGSING

Sorry!
Wang-Wang smashes the window button. Doesn’t go down.
WANG-WANG
[MOM. UNLOCK THE WINDOW.]
WANG-WANG
媽媽. UNLOCK THE WINDOW.
CHUNGSING

CHUNGSING

Chungsing clicks from her side of the car. Nothing.
CHUNGSING (CONT’D)
[It’s broken.]
CHUNGSING (CONT’D)
壞了.
WANG-WANG
IT’S BROKEN!?!? Oh my god. I’m

Wang-Wang tucks his head inside his shirt like a turtle.
CHUNGSING
[You’re so dramatic! A fart
is a fart.]
CHUNGSING
你太dramatic了，屁就是屁嘛!
Beat. Chungsing takes deep sniffs.

      They drive. Wang-Wang sits quiet, his head still tucked in
his shirt. Chungsing sniffs.
CHUNGSING (CONT’D)
Mmm. The salad I ate today.
CHUNGSING (CONT’D)
Mmm. 我今天吃的沙拉.
Head still tucked, Wang-Wang glances over –– gross.
Finally, she stops.
CHUNGSING (CONT’D)
[Okay. All gone.]
CHUNGSING (CONT’D)
好了，都沒了.
Beat. They drive in silence. Chungsing glances over at Wang￾Wang...still senses a sadness.

Wang-Wang throws his hoodie back, pops his head back out.
Looks at Chungsing...shakes his head.
INT. MCDONALD’S - LATER
Chungsing watches as Wang-Wang gleefully scarfs down a
McChicken. A Happy Meal box sits in front of them.
CHUNGSING (CONT’D)
[Slower. You have to let the
saliva soak in the food. You
eat like a little dog.
Smaller bites.]
CHUNGSING (CONT’D)
吃慢點，你要讓你的⼝⽔和⻝物混起來

Wang-Wang shoots Chungsing a look that says: seriously? But
then, flashes his half-chewed food to Chungsing.
CHUNGSING (CONT’D)
(laughing)
[Don’t show your ABC!]
CHUNGSING (CONT’D)
不要 show 你的 ABC!
Wang-Wang laughs along. A sweet moment.
Beat. Chungsing disassembles her burger. Wang-Wang observes.
WANG-WANG

      Chungsing forks a bite of the bun, then puts a chunk of patty
in her mouth separately -- eating it like a platter.
WANG-WANG
You’re so Asian...
Chungsing takes this in. She looks at her little
boy...continues eating as well, fork to mouth...then,
CHUNGSING
[Didi.] You should be proud of
being an Asian. Asians possess many
good qualities and good values...
Don’t look down Asians. That you
look down Asians is that you look
down yourself.
WANG-WANG
......why are you talking to me in
English?
CHUNGSING

[I talked to Shiu Fang Ah

      Then, a tiny crumpled up piece of paper decks him in the
head. He glances around. Every student with their heads down.
He notices a scattered sea of paper balls.
Then, a snicker to his left. It’s Max and JOSH, 15, another
try-hard wannabe-gangster Asian kid.
MAX
Dude, stop. Our moms are friends.
Wang-Wang glares at them, then looks back down. Does nothing.
INT. WANG-WANG’S HOUSE / CHUNGSING'S BEDROOM - DAY
CLOSE on a letter. We see glimpses of sentences: 
“Thank you for submitting”
“regret to inform” 
“not selected” 
“Sincerely, Committee for National Painters’ Association”
REVEAL –- Chungsing gripping the rejection letter. Sighs.
INT. WANG-WANG’S HOUSE / WANG-WANG’S ROOM - DAY
On his computer screen, CLOSE on a series of Jade’s Facebook 
photos that Fahad is tagged in. An album titled `08 SUMMER! :] – 
Wang-Wang clicks through: them at the AMUSEMENT PARK, web￾cam screenshots, the photo of Fahad, Jade and Ellie at 
Golfland that Wang-Wang took. He lingers on this...then -
An AIM window pops up: a message from Madi:
MeowwwitsMadix3:heyyyyyy
MeowwwitsMadix3 is typing...
MeowwwitsMadix3:are you mad at me?
Wang-Wang stares at the blinking cursor...then types:

      Then, his phone rings, a generic ringtone now. He checks the

WANG-WANG
Hello?
A voice on the other end speaks and Wang-Wang PERKS UP.
INT. WANG-WANG’S HOUSE / KITCHEN - LATER
Wang-Wang rushes in to Chungsing, washing dishes. Nai Nai
looming beside her, bickering. Vivian sits on the couch
nearby, reading.
WANG-WANG

Nai Nai snatches the plate out of Chungsing’s hands, but
Chungsing JERKS it back, knocking it out of both of their
hands and onto the floor. It SHATTERS next to Wang-Wang.
CHUNGSING
[NAI NAI! WILL YOU GO AWAY!?
FOR JUST ONE SECOND?!]
CHUNGSING
奶奶! 你就不能放⼿別管嗎!?

      All of a sudden, silent and still. Nai Nai, staggered. Wang￾Wang, stunned. Scared, almost.
Chungsing fumes. She kneels down and picks up the shards, a
small cut bleeding from her finger. Wang-Wang observes...
Vivian shuffles next to Wang-Wang.
VIVIAN
Hey. I’ll take you. Come on.
Wang-Wang looks at his sister...
INT. CHUNGSING’S CAR - LATER
Vivian drives. It’s quiet. Wang-Wang stares out the window.
VIVIAN (CONT’D)
You okay?
Wang-Wang nods, but clearly still shaken. Silent tension.
They coast. Then, spotted. Across an industrial lot: Donovan.
WANG-WANG
Oh, it’s right here.
EXT. INDUSTRIAL BUSINESS PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS
Vivian pulls in.
VIVIAN
This is where you and your friends
hang out? Business parking lots?
WANG-WANG
Yeah. You can just park right here.
Vivian stops. Wang-Wang unbuckles his seatbelt. Grabs his
board. Opens the door.
WANG-WANG (CONT’D)
Uh...thanks for the ride.
VIVIAN
No problem...I think I’m gonna stay
out for a while too so...call me if
you need a ride later or something.

Ayeeeee, Chris! / Hey!!!! / Yoooo.
They’re super welcoming. Donovan dabs him up -- all smiles.
DONOVAN
Stoked you could make it! Lets
stack some clips, dawwwg.
MOMENTS LATER
Wang-Wang stands on a ledge, camera pointed toward a stair
set. Donovan and Nugget huck tricks down it, catching some in
mid-air, then kicking out. Or sticking some, falling off.
Cory sits near Wang-Wang, staring at him film.
CORY
...You kinda look like a pervert
when you hold the camera like that.
Beat. Noted. Switches to an underhand grip.
Donovan hucks a tre flip down the set. Flies off.
DONOVAN
Chris! How’s it look?
WANG-WANG
(no idea)
Uhh, good!
Donovan runs back up the set as Nugget jumps down. Falls.
NUGGET
Shooooooot!
Nugget clears to the left of the set, making way for Donovan.
As he throws down his board, a RENT-A-COP, 50s, Santa-bodied
hag, storms out of the entrance, bumping Donovan.
DONOVAN
Oh shi- w’sup.
RENT-A-COP
Get off the property.

Sir, can you not yell in my face

PREMISES.
DONOVAN

QUIT YELLING AT ME!
CORY
WE’RE JUST TRYING TO MAKE A
REALISTIC MOVIE OVER HERE, MAN!
As the rent-a-cop shouts, Donovan shouts back to cancel him
out. Verbal mayhem. Wang-Wang’s recording the whole thing --
we we see him zoom all the way in from the viewfinder.
RENT-A-COP
GET OFF. GET OFF MY LOT.
DONOVAN
(yelling gibberish)
AHHRARHAHRAHRHA -
AHARHRARHARARARAHHHHRAH
The rent-a-cop reaches for Donovan’s board. Donovan reaches
back. Then the cop SHOVES Donovan. Donovan stumbles, but uses
it as momentum to JUKE him -
He shuffles past the rent-a-cop. Drops his board down, rides
up to the set and -
POP - SCOOP - FLICK - LANDS - BOLTS. Turns and flips off the
rent-a-cop as he rides away.
Cory and Nugget SMACK their boards on the ground, cheering.

backseat with Cory, clipping his toenails.
DONOVAN
Bro, quit clipping your toenails in

Clippings fly towards Wang-Wang. He flinches.

Vivian tear posters off her wall; stuffing belongings in
boxes; clearing drawers, etc.
Vivian tippy-toes on her chair, peeling glow-in-the-dark
sticker planets off her ceiling. Wang-Wang spots her.

fitted beanie, their influence clearly making a mark on him.
CUE MONTAGE –– a series of lifestyle moments in VARIOUS
LOCATIONS of them just hanging out, shot on Wang-Wang’s
camcorder:
-Cory, asleep at a spot. Nugget throws water on his face. He
spits awake.

finger gestures and dances. Donovan laughs.

EXT. MACK’S HOUSE / BACKYARD - NIGHT
A kickback. Music bumps. Teenagers playing beer pong, smoking
hookah, weed -- people seshing a DIY mini-ramp. A hazy sight.
The boys enter through the back door. Almost immediately,
MACK, 17, larger-than-life, funny-as-fuck, appears:
MACK

He glances over. A few TEENS cutting up lines of cocaine on
the coffee table.
Then, an OLDER COUPLE, 18, collapses on the seat beside him.
She’s on his lap. He’s feeling her up. Necking...until it
turns into a full blown, sensual dry hump-make out.

      Wang-Wang just sits there. Tries to ignore it...but just
feels too uncomfortable. He jets off.
INT. MACK’S HOUSE / KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER
Wang-Wang eyes the snacks. He sees a tray full of plastic
cups of JELLO. He sucks one down. His face scrunches: liquor.
His eyes scan for drinks. He spots a WATER BOTTLE. Unscrews
it. Waterfalls a sip: vodka. Scrunches again.
He searches for a palette cleanser. Spotted: a pan of LEMON
BARS. He chunks off a piece. Washes the taste away.
EXT. MACK’S HOUSE / BACKYARD - MOMENTS LATER
Wang-Wang wanders, then spots a GROUP of TEENS, Mack,
Donovan, Nugget, Cory included, posted in a circle, smoking a
blunt and free-styling.
Wang-Wang slides in next to Donovan, fist bumping him.
MACK (O.S.)
Cuz we crack-a-lackin’ nd mackin’,
smokin’ nd tokin’ in the 510. And
y’all ready know.
Someone passes Wang-Wang the blunt. Down to its last
tokes...he studies it, then hits it.
MACK (CONT’D)
We smoke the dro’, and I don’t got
an A-fro! But i’m black-as-fuck,
and i’mma bust-a-nut -

On yo FACE!
CROWD
OHHH!! / AYEEEE!!!
Everyone laughs. Wang-Wang passes the blunt to Donovan.
DONOVAN
I’m good. I don’t smoke.
Oh. Passes it to Mack instead. He tries to smoke it but -
MACK
Think it’s dunzo.
WANG-WANG

WANG-WANG

MACK

WANG-WANG
Yeah, like...
Wang-Wang thinks: a chance to impress. He reaches for the
roach. Mack hands it over.
Wang-Wang studies it for a beat, then smokes the last bit of
the blunt, attempts to take a deep drag. The weed lights...
...then he straight INHALES IT like he did the sticky-note
joint. He swallows, but this time coughs up a lung.
DONOVAN
What the f...
The crowd is quiet. Eyes wide, genuinely concerned, but then -
MACK
YoooOOOOO! THIS ASIAN MO’FUCKA JUST
ATE THE ROACH!
Mood lightens. Everyone laughs. What. Just. Happened.

Wang-Wang’s eyes tear up - his throat burning. Coughing
still, but smiles through it all as everyone hypes him up.
His vision and hearing starts to blur...
INT. MACK’S HOUSE / LIVING ROOM - LATER
Wang-Wang drifts through the room, zooted out of his mind.
The sights and sounds of the world blurring around him.
He looks around and sees: a GUY with 6 EYES AND 3 PAIRS OF
GLASSES, all blinking out of sync; a trio of friends, their
heads the DRAGONS from Golfland; and the DEAD SQUIRREL, a
halo over it’s head. It speaks to Wang-Wang.
DEAD SQUIRREL
Chris.
(beat)
Why did you kill me? This is why
nobody loves you because you hurt
people...
(freaky animal sounds)
Aghalkfg...squirREL!!!
Wang-Wang takes this in, but also...WTF is happening.
He turns and sees a couch: perfect.
He stumbles toward it, but the couch gets seemingly further
away with every step. Eventually, he makes it and collapses
onto the couch. He closes his eyes and --

CHUNGSING (O.S.)

Wang-Wang pukes into the toilet. Panting. Crossfaded --
Everything, all at once, for the first time.
Vivian pats his back, hands him a glass of water.
VIVIAN
Here.
Wang-Wang shakes his head. Vivian forces him the glass.
VIVIAN (CONT’D)
Drink.
He groans, takes a sip of the water.
VIVIAN (CONT’D)
Didn’t I say to not to do anything
stupid...
WANG-WANG

Please don’t tell mom.
Vivian observes Wang-Wang with the realization that in this
moment, he’s not just the little brother -- little kid --
he’s always been anymore.
VIVIAN
I wont...You okay?
Wang-Wang HEAVES. Nope.
VIVIAN (CONT’D)
Okay, never mind. Don’t talk.

VIVIAN (CONT’D)

WANG-WANG
Bye.
Vivian kinda-sorta reaches her arms out for a hug. Wang-Wang
holds for a beat, then awkwardly embraces her.
They let go and look at each other -- that was weird.
VIVIAN
...try and be nice to Mom, okay?
Beat. He nods. They share a stilted smile -- an understanding
that there is love between them, as stifled as it is.
Vivian hops into the car. Nai-Nai waves goodbye as they
leave.

      INT. WANG-WANG’S HOUSE / VIVIAN’S BEDROOM - DAY
Wang-Wang steps into Vivian’s room, stripped of personality.
Bare walls, naked floor -- all that’s left is a bed and desk.
Wang-Wang spots a sweater on the bed. He unfolds it: it’s
Vivian’s UCSD sweater.
He hugs the sweater close, plops down onto her bed, and scans
the room, taking it in.
INT. WANG-WANG’S HOUSE / WANG-WANG’S ROOM - DAY
On Wang-Wang’s computer: a FACEBOOK MESSENGER chat box.

Clacking of a keyboard...ENTER.
thx for the sweater
Wang-Wang exits the chat with Vivian. Scrolls over to his
news feed. Sees a Facebook Status from Madi: BLAH. hate when i do
something wrong && feel like a shittyyyy person );
Wang-Wang registers this...
Then, a hip-hop ringtone plays -- the same song that was
playing in Donovan’s car -- and pierces the quiet.
Wang-Wang lets the phone ring for a few seconds, then -
WANG-WANG

As Wang-Wang listens to the other line, he LAUNCHES up.

Wang-Wang walks in. Donovan and Cory posted up by his desk.
Donovan fucks around with a tech deck.
WANG-WANG
We don’t have any snacks.
CORY

Wang-Wang takes a seat in his chair. They huddle behind him.

Wang-Wang shrugs.

On Wang-Wang’s computer screen. He clicks open the clip of
Donovan bickering with the rent-a-cop in Windows Movie Maker.
DONOVAN (O.S.)
Man, that guy was fuckin’ whack.
As Donovan jukes the rent-a-cop and skates toward the stair
set, the camera is still terribly zoomed in, frantically
attempting to course-correct -- too late.
We hear the POP - SCOOP - FLICK. The cheers. The celebration.
But the footage is an absolute blur. Completely unusable.
Donovan and Nugget, hovered behind Wang-Wang, blank-faced.
NUGGET
Yo Donovan, I’m no expert so maybe
I’m wrong here...but I don’t think
you can put that in your tape, bro.

Under a sub-category labeled ‘gut boys’ is fahadtheg0d --

Wang-Wang double clicks his screen-name, opening a new

Types “MY” in the URL bar. Glides his cursor down to an
autocomplete suggestion of Fahad’s Myspace page. *CLICK*
The page loads. Wang-Wang scans the page -- minimally
designed. A few HTML flourishes and images that express his
love for streetwear and underground hip-hop. ;Online Now.
He scrolls down to Fahad’s Top 8 Friends section. He looks
through them, his cursor hovering over each profile, and it
sinks in: Wang-Wang, nowhere to be found.
Wang-Wang closes the page. He moves his cursor back to the

Then, Wang-Wang opens the car door and jumps out, SLAMMING

Wang-Wang posts up underneath an awning. The wind howls. It’s
dark. Cold. Late. He shivers.
A rustle in the bush beside him. Wang-Wang turns. High alert.
He hears footsteps and voices behind him. He turns. Nobody.
He pulls out his phone. 12:14am. 2% battery left. No missed
calls. He clicks through to MOM. Contemplates...
Then, a car pulls into the parking lot nearby. Headlights
shining right at him. Then, they shut off.
Nobody gets out. Wang-Wang lingers. His heart pounding.
Muffled voices from inside the car. Windows fogging up.
Finally, the car door opens. Smoke billows out. An older
teenage boy steps out, coughing.
Nope. Wang-Wang BOOKS IT. Not looking back. Terrified.

CHUNGSING (CONT’D)
你還記得Vivian
⼗四歲那次跑⾛的時候嗎?
Wang-Wang shakes his head.
CHUNGSING (CONT’D)
[She asked me to sleepover at
Annie’s house, and I didn’t
let her. She got so mad at
me. I still remember she
looked at me and said, Mom,]
I just want you to know that
I hate you...I feel so hurt.
[And then, she ran away. She
was gone for three days. I
was so scared. Then, one day,
she just came home. She
didn’t talk to me. Wouldn’t
look at me. But I was so
happy...]
(tearing up, but
laughing)
[Compared to her, you are not
as stubborn. So I knew you
would come home.]
CHUNGSING (CONT’D)
她問我能不能去Annie家
sleepover，我沒答應. 她氣死了.
我還記得她看著我，說, 媽媽, I
just want you to know that I
hate you...I feel so hurt.
說完，她就跑掉了. 她三天都沒回家.
我當時好害怕.
後來有⼀天，她⾃⼰就回來了.
也不跟我講話也不看我⼀眼.
但是...我還是很開⼼...
(tearing up, but
laughing)
跟她⽐啊，你還沒那麼stubborn.
所以我知道你⼀定會回來.
Wang-Wang takes this all in. Chungsing sighs.

      CHUNGSING (CONT’D)
[Didi, you know. Sometimes I
sit and think about how I
ended up here. Just an
ordinary housewife. And it is
true. I do wonder
sometimes...is this it? What
would my life be like if I
didn’t marry your father and
have you and Vivian. Would I
be happier? Maybe now I would
be a successful artist in New
York City with my own studio
and gallery. I allow myself
to dream. But then, as soon
as I see you, I know - this
is where I want to be. Didi,
being your mother is really
difficult, but getting to
watch you and Vivian grow up
here, make friends, and learn
so many things I can’t teach
you, I realize...you are my
dream.] I’m so proud.
(sighs)
[But with your dad not
around, and Nai Nai always
criticizing me for how I
raise you and Vivian -
sometimes it’s really too
much. And sometimes I
think...maybe I failed as a
mother. But I know - no
matter what - I must do my
best to love you both. That
is my duty.]
(beat)
But it is a little hard.
CHUNGSING (CONT’D)
弟啊，你知道嗎.
有時候我坐在這我就在想我是怎麼落到
現在這樣的. 只是個普通家庭主婦.
我有時候想...難道我就這樣了嗎？如
果我沒嫁給你的爸爸，沒有你跟Vivia
n 我會是什麼樣.
會不會⽐較幸福？也許我會⼀個⼈來美
國，現在是個成功的藝術家，在紐約有
⾃⼰的⼯作室....sometimes I
dream.
但是，當我看⾒你跟Vivian的時候，
我知道 - 這就是我想要的...
弟弟，當你們的媽媽真的很不容易，但
看⾒你跟Vivian在這裡⻑⼤，交朋友
，還學了那麼多我教不了你們的東西，
我才明⽩...你們才是我的夢想.]
I’m so proud.
(sighs)
但是爸爸不在家，奶奶⼜時常對我怎麼
教育你們指⼿畫腳￾有時真的太過份了.
我會覺得...也許我是個失敗的媽媽.
但我知道 - 不管怎樣 -
我都會盡我所能地愛護你們.
這是我的責任.
(beat)
But it is a little hard.
Chungsing chuckles. She gives Wang-Wang a hug. And for once,
he lets her.
INT. ORTHODONTIST'S OFFICE - DAY
Dr. Wong clips Wang-Wang’s braces off.
INT. ORTHODONTIST'S OFFICE / BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER
Wang-Wang gurgles and rinses. He rubs his lips and tongue all
over his new, naked, slimy teeth -- a new sensation.

      INT. IRVINGTON HIGH SCHOOL / AUDITORIUM - DAY
Wang-Wang poses in front of a backdrop and beams an awkward
tooth-y smile -- like it’s the first time he’s ever smiled.
And photo FLASH. A beam of WHITE fills the screen -
MOMENTS LATER
- and that same tooth-y smile, now imprinted on a rectangle
of laminated white plastic. An ASB volunteer parent hands
Wang-Wang his Freshman ID card and a MINI COMBO PADLOCK.
WANG-WANG
Thanks.
INT. IRVINGTON HIGH SCHOOL / HALLWAY - LATER
Wang-Wang strolls down the hallway, glancing left and right
at small cliques of friends walking past him and claiming
their locker spots. He searches for an unclaimed locker.
He turns the corner and across the hall, he sees Madi,
dressed in Student Body Welcome Back attire.
He stops. Contemplates. Takes a deep breath -- walks over.
Madi clamps her locker shut, resetting her padlock combo.
WANG-WANG (CONT’D)
Madi?
Madi turns, pleased, surprised, and...are you serious?
MADI
Oh, hey.
WANG-WANG
Hi.
MADI
What’s up?
WANG-WANG
Ummm. I just went to my
orthodontist.
MADI
Nice.
WANG-WANG
Did you get a haircut?

      MADI
No.
WANG-WANG
Oh.
Beat. Awkward.
WANG-WANG (CONT’D)
Umm, listen I just wanted to
say...sorry for not messaging you
back lately. I was...back to school
shopping...and...no, I got - uh - I
think I just got nervous about
everything but...I think you’re
really cool and I was wondering if
you’d maybe want to, like, hang out
again...ever...
MADI
............you punched my friend
Josh in the face.
Long beat. Wang-Wang, no rebuttal -- this is true.
MADI (CONT’D)
Yeah, uhh, okay. Well, I’m sure
I’ll see you around when school
starts.
Wang-Wang nods. Understood.
WANG-WANG
Okay.
MADI
Later...freshman.
Madi walks off, giving him a glimmer of a smile. Wang-Wang
takes the hint. Hurts, but proud that he stepped up.
INT. IRVINGTON HIGH SCHOOL / STUDENT UNION - LATER
We SHUFFLE through a series of CLOSE UPs on CLASS SCHEDULES,
HIGH SCHOOL MERCHANDISE, DIY STUDENT-MADE BANNERS, careening
us into the cacophany that is -
EXT. IRVINGTON HIGH SCHOOL / COURTYARD - LATER
- ORIENTATION in full swing. Teenage chaos. Banners and
booths everywhere. Hella KIDS yelling and screaming,
reuniting with their friends post-summer break.

      Wang-Wang walks around, looking at the different options as
we DRIFT from booth to booth. Different clubs recruiting
fresh meat: DECA, INTERACT, SPEECH AND DEBATE, MECHA, DANCE --
each recruitment spiel dissolving into the next.
Wang-Wang spots Soup checking out the DANCE club booth, Fahad
at SPEECH & DEBATE.
Fahad glances over from afar -- they make eye contact.
Beat. Wang-Wang, unsure of what their dynamic is...then -
Fahad shoots Wang-Wang a subtle head nod, the slightest
indication of acknowledgment of his presence and the pain of
their friendship at the moment - in the most 13-year old way
possible.
Wang-Wang reciprocates. Turns back toward the booth.
Wang-Wang scans his surroundings. Then, one booth catches his
eye. Its banner: CAMERAS, GRAFFITI, LIGHTS, etc.
He approaches the Visual Arts Club. It’s REP, 15, speaking to
a small group of INCOMING FRESHMEN. Wang-Wang joins.
VISUAL ARTS CLUB REP
- and this year, we’re doing a
mural, more analog photography, and
we just got a big donation of video
equipment too so we’re hoping to
make more video art this year.
As she speaks, Wang-Wang looks at the interested students.
They all look a little artsy and weird in the best way -- he
may not know it yet, but these are his people.
VISUAL ARTS CLUB REP (O.S.) (CONT’D)
You can sign up here for more info
and we’ll let you know when our
first meeting of the year is!
A cool-as-shit, down-to-earth GIRL, 13, fills in the sign up
sheet. She hands the pen to Wang-Wang.
He grabs it. Takes a look at the form. He signs up.
In scribbly, chicken scratch handwriting, he writes:
Chris Wang

      EXT. IRVINGTON HIGH SCHOOL / PARKING LOT - EVENING
The sun setting, a golden glow over the town. Chungsing waits
in the car. Wang-Wang climbs in to the passenger seat.
CHUNGSING
Hi, [Didi.]
CHUNGSING
Hi, 弟弟.
WANG-WANG
Hi.
Chungsing drives off.
CHUNGSING
[How was today?]
CHUNGSING
今天怎麼樣?
WANG-WANG
It was good.
(beat)
I signed up for the Visual Arts
Club.
Beat. Chungsing looks over, smiles.
CHUNGSING
[Have you eaten yet?]
CHUNGSING
你吃過飯了嗎?
INT. WANG-WANG’S HOUSE / HALLWAY - EVENING
Chungsing and Wang-Wang creep down the hallway, passing by
Nai Nai’s room -- sleeping. Peacefully snoring.
INT. WANG-WANG’S HOUSE / KITCHEN - NIGHT
Wang-Wang sits at the kitchen table. Chungsing pulls a Zong
Zi out of the rice cooker, unwraps it for Wang-Wang, and sets
it in front of him -- still steaming.
Wang-Wang grabs a pair of chopsticks and scarfs it down.
Chungsing sits beside him, watching him eat. This time, she
says nothing. She rests her head and observes.
She brushes her hand through Wang-Wang’s hair, moving it out
of his face.
Wang-Wang stirs, but doesn’t pull back. He tilts his head up
and looks up at his Mom.
She smiles at him and for the first time, he sees her: her
strands of white hair, wrinkles, sun spots –– her humanity.

      Through their look, a rare moment of affection.
Wang-Wang returns to his food and we revel in this moment of
suburban stillness, domestic quiet, a boy -- longing to be
something and someone else, but still just a boy -- and his
mother’s love.
FADE TO BLACK.
