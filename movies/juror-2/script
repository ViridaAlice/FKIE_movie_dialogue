      1 INT. KEMP HOUSE - HALLWAY/NURSERY - DAY 1
A BLINDFOLDED WOMAN (30's, nice skin, full lips, which right
now are trembling.)
PULLING BACK we see she's in a summer dress, standing in the
hallway of the second-floor of a suburban home.
JUSTIN
Okay. You ready?
Before her, in front of a closed door, is JUSTIN KEMP (30's,
broad shoulders, warm smile, Mr. All-American with some pain
behind his eyes.)
He opens the door. Leans forward and gently removes her
blindfold.
And now we can see ALLISON KEMP in full. She is PREGNANT,
and her eyes, normally piercing and curious, are anxious as
she enters the room Justin just opened the door to and sees --
A NURSERY
Fully decorated for a baby girl. Crib. Changing table.
Rocking horse. Nursing chair. Understated pink wall-paper.
Her face goes flush, lips pursed. Does she hate it?
Justin looks at her, hopeful. Squeezes her hand.
She takes in the room, lets out a deep breath. Smiling now,
through happy tears.
ALLISON
It's beautiful. Thank you.
(searching for the
words)
It would've been a lot for me.
Justin nods. Puts his hand on her belly. Looks at her.
They're truly connected in this moment... until the sound of
a CAR PULLING UP outside on the street takes them out of it.
ALLISON (CONT’D)
Of course they're early.
She's clearly apprehensive but he gives her a calming look
that says: "Stick with me. Everything's gonna be fine."

2 EXT. KEMP HOUSE - BACKYARD - DAY 2
A backyard BBQ for Justin and Allison's FRIENDS, COLLEAGUES
and NEIGHBORS.
Allison's outstretched on a chaise, feet up, flanked by
pillows. Holding court like suburban Cleopatra in her third
trimester.
ALLISON
(to her GIRLFRIENDS)
Bed rest is great. I can't go
anywhere. Or do anything. But
really, I'm fine. I can't wait to be
a Mom, but I miss my kids. If all
goes well, I'll be back at school
full-time next fall.
The back door opens and Justin, apron on, weaves through the
party with a plate of ready to grill burgers, dogs and buns.
JUSTIN
(to some NEIGHBORS)
Hope you came hungry.
(to some COLLEAGUES)
There's beer in the cooler.
Smiles and nods all around. Justin the consummate host.
He gets to the grill and throws the meat on. It SIZZLES.
Turns to look at some of the kids practicing lacrosse.
JUSTIN (CONT’D)
(to KIDS)
Hey, Mikey. You almost have it.
Remember. Point, Push and Pull. You
got this kid.
Justin high fives him and turns to the parents.
JUSTIN (CONT’D)
(to some FRIENDS)
I see a lacrosse title in our
future, boys. Whatever you're
feeding those sons of yours, it's
working.
FRIENDS
Amen, Coach.
Alison and friends look on.

ALLISON’S FRIEND
(to Allison)
He is just so charming, isn’t he.
ALLISON
I got lucky with him.
A NEIGHBOR pulls a beer from the cooler. Offers Justin one.
JUSTIN
I'm good, thanks.
BUZZ - a TEXT comes through. Justin checks it. It’s a text
from a prospective car buyer.
ALLISON
Who you texting? Everyone’s here?
JUSTIN
It’s just somebody interested in
the 4Runner.
Justin gives her a knowing smile and shimmies back to the
grill. He flips the meat on the grill. It has a gorgeous
sear.
Allison nods. She watches Justin lovingly as he tries to
pull a bun off the grill with his bare hand and nearly burns
it.
Over this, the DINGING of a spoon tapping against glass.
3 EXT. KEMP HOUSE - BACKYARD - LATER 3
Lunch is over. The party's gathered around Justin and
Allison as he gives a little speech.
JUSTIN
I was thinking the other day about
this woman who turned me down twenty￾six times before she agreed to a
date. We met at dusk down on River
Street and did one of those "penny
walks" where you flip a coin at the
end of each block. Heads you go
left, tails you go right. Over the
next few hours we saw the whole
city, talking and laughing, and at
the end of the evening I couldn't
help myself... I asked her the
question that had been burning in my
mind all night: "What made you
change your mind? Why'd you finally
say yes?"

JUSTIN (CONT’D)
And she says: "I had to know what
kind of guy asks someone out twenty￾seven times."
Laughter. Allison smiles.
JUSTIN (CONT’D)
"So...?" I asked. "What's the
verdict?"
(to Allison)
Do you remember what you said?
ALLISON
"You're the kind of guy who forgets
his wallet on a first date and is
too scared to tell me."
JUSTIN
I was terrified. All I had was the
change in my pocket so I'd
improvised. But it was the best
night of my life. And three years
later, here we are.
Awwws.
JUSTIN (CONT’D)
I'll be honest, Allison and I
weren't sure about whether to have
this party.
(he looks at
Allison)
But together there's nothing we
can't overcome. You're the
strongest woman I know and I love
you more than anything. And I am so
damn excited to keep building our
life together.
Laughter and applause.
ALLISON’S FREIND
(hitting her boyfriend)
Why don’t you ever say things like
that to me?
Justin and Allison kiss.
4 INT. KEMP HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT 4
Justin puts the dishes away. A toilet flushes Allison enters
from the hallway.

JUSTIN
Your vitamins are on the table.
Her prenatal vitamins and a water are on the kitchen island.
ALLISON
Thanks.
(she swallows them,
chases with water)
It was a good party.
JUSTIN
You deserve it.
ALLISON
You're just buttering me up before
you abandon me.
Grabs the JURY SUMMONS from a pile of mail. Gives it to him.
JUSTIN
I wish I could delay it again.
(pockets it)
I don't like leaving you here.
ALLISON
I'm not an invalid.
(then)
Just tell the Judge something wildly
inappropriate and come back to me.
JUSTIN
Deal.
She waddles out of the room. Shuts off the kitchen light.
ALLISON
Sorry!
She turns it back on. Justin watches her go. So in love.
5 EXT. KEMP HOUSE - MORNING 5
Justin pulls away in the 4Runner. Waves to Allison in the
window.
6 INT. TOYOTA 4RUNNER - MORNING 6
Justin drives through the downtown area of this small
Southern city marked by Antebellum architecture, cobblestone
streets and big oak trees covered in Spanish moss on this
fall day.
Up ahead is the city's MUNICIPAL COMPLEX headed by CITY HALL.

7 EXT. CITY HALL - MORNING 7
A packed parking lot across the street from the COURTHOUSE.
The SIGN in front of it reads:
RESERVED - F. KILLEBREW
ASSISTANT DISTRICT ATTORNEY
Assistant District Attorney FAITH KILLEBREW (40's, fierce and
focused) sits in the driver's seat, talking on the phone
while sorting various files on her passenger's side front
seat.
CAMPAIGN MANAGER (V.O.)
... Polling has you in a forty-six
point deadlock. Eight percent
undecided. Maybe we should leak
what we have.
FAITH
This case IS my campaign. I put
James Sythe away, we win.
She hangs up. Exits the car -- grabbing her purse, briefcase
and some files -- and shuts the door with her shoulder,
knocking her phone from her jacket pocket onto the ground.
But she doesn't notice it fall and walks away, towards The
SUPERIOR COURT BUILDING, a stately structure surrounded by
lawn, all under the watchful eye of an iconic bell tower.
Local TV NEWS CREWS are camped outside. A one-ring circus.
JUSTIN
Hey!
She keeps walking.
JUSTIN (CONT’D)
HEY! HOLD UP!
She turns, expecting a camera and microphone in her face, but
instead she sees JUSTIN approaching, out of breath.
JUSTIN (CONT’D)
I think you dropped this.
He holds up her PHONE. She pats herself down. No phone.
FAITH
Yes I did.
He hands it to her.

JUSTIN
I saw you getting out of your car

FAITH

Right.
JUSTIN
You need a hand with it...?
FAITH
Nope, I'm good.
JUSTIN
Well, have nice day then.
FAITH
You, too.
She turns and walks away. Justin waits a beat to give her
space and heads to the main entrance.
8 INT. SUPERIOR COURT - LOBBY/1ST FLOOR - MORNING 8
Justin exits security and heads to the VISITOR CHECK-IN desk.
He hands a BAILIFF (50's, female, battle axe) his jury
summons.
The Deputy checks it against a list, makes a mark, and hands
Justin a sticker with a number on it.
9 INT. SUPERIOR COURT - JURY HOLDING ROOM - MORNING 9
The JURY POOL (split pretty evenly between African-American
and Caucasian, with other ethnicities sprinkled in) sits on
folding chairs in organized rows.
Justin enters, sticks his badge on his shirt. He peers
around, takes it all in. The BAILIFF hands him a
QUESTIONNAIRE.
He takes it and sits, looks over the questionnaire as the
Bailiff wheels out an old TV. She hits play on a DVD and a
jury orientation video begins with a picture of the STATE
SEAL backed by patriotic music and heavy-handed VOICE-OVER.
JURY VIDEO
As jurors, you make decisions that
change people's lives.

10 INT. SUPERIOR COURT - ROTUNDA - MORNING 10
Faith sighs at the long line for the COURTHOUSE COFFEE CART.
But then Assistant Public Defender ERIC RESNICK (40's) turns
around from the cashier with two coffees, one for her.
RESNICK
(approaches, hands
it to her)
Sugar free vanilla with skim.
FAITH
You're good.
RESNICK
Do you have something for me?
FAITH
Voluntary manslaughter, with a
recommendation of 20 years - 15 to
serve, followed by 5 on probation.
Standard conditions.
RESNICK
Wow. That's a helluva deal.
FAITH
I’ll even waive the recidivist
statute, if he pleads before we
strike the jury.
RESNICK
Oooooooooo.....
They walk up the stairs and keep talking.
RESNICK (CONT’D)
And admit to something he didn't
do...?
FAITH
Save that for the jury. Or better
yet, plead your guy out and go back
to your three-figure caseload.
RESNICK
My client wants a trial.

They reach the top of the stairs, arriving at COURTROOM 304.
FAITH (CONT’D)
Last chance.
Resnick considers it... and opens the door. Motions for
Faith to enter.
She gives him a look: "Okay, game on then." Walks inside.
11 INT. SUPERIOR COURT - COURT ROOM 304 - MORNING 11
JUDGE THELMA STEWART, four decades on the bench, addresses
the jury pool, who sit in the gallery.
THE JUDGE
The case you are about to hear is
an alleged homicide.
Justin and the jury pool perk up. As he takes in the
courtroom, he notices Faith sitting at the prosecution's
table. Her back is to the gallery but he can tell it's her.
THE JUDGE (CONT’D)
The state is charging James Michael
Sythe with Malice Murder for the
death of Kendall Alice Carter.
JAMES MICHAEL SYTHE (20's) sits at the defense table. Wide￾eyed, wiry, worried. A quick glance and you wouldn't peg him
for a killer. Spot the TATTOO creeping onto his neck (a
SNAKE WRAPPED AROUND a CROWN with the lettering WC in blood
droplets below it) and maybe you would...
Resnick, his lawyer, puts a hand on Sythe's knee to stop him
from tapping his foot.
THE JUDGE (CONT’D)
If any of you have a personal
relationship with the accused and/or
the deceased that will prohibit you
from serving on this panel in an
unbiased manner, please speak now.
YOLANDA (40's) raises her hand.
YOLANDA

YOLANDA
He was obnoxious. Loud.
Disruptive. I'm in a mood just
seeing his face.
THE JUDGE
When was this?
YOLANDA
I don't know. Few years ago.
THE JUDGE
Then there's no reason we can't
leave it there. I think you'll make
a fine juror.
Yolanda scoffs. Judge Stewart continues.
THE JUDGE (CONT’D)
Is there anyone else who feels
they're incapable of serving on this
panel?
Justin raises his hand. The Judge motions to him.
JUSTIN
Your Honor, my wife is in the third
trimester of a high-risk pregnancy.
I'd like to be available to her.
THE JUDGE
That's commendable. What hours do
you normally work?
JUSTIN
Nine to six, typically.
THE JUDGE
I see.
(Justin perks up)
You have my word that this court
will not demand a minute more of
your time than that.
Justin can't help but smile. Touché.
THE JUDGE (CONT’D)
The fact that you don't want to be
here is exactly why you're the
perfect group to adjudicate this
case. You are impartial;

as it may be, is still our best
chance at finding justice.
12 INT. SUPERIOR COURT - COURT ROOM 304 - DAY 12
INTERCUT between Faith and Resnick doing VOIR DIRE -- asking
questions to the potential jurors sitting in the gallery.
FAITH with DENICE (40's, soccer-Mom, very fit and put
together.)
FAITH
Do you work, Mrs. Aldworth?
DENICE
I had the toughest job there is.
Raised two kids and sent them to
college.
FAITH
Congratulations. Have you ever
served on a jury before?
DENICE
Twice. Both were mistrials.
RESNICK questions MARCUS (30's, rough-looking, intense.)
RESNICK
Mr. King, have you ever had a
physical altercation with a
significant other?
MARCUS
You gonna ask that question to every
guy you bring into this box?
(off Resnick's look)
Nah, man. That ain't me.
FAITH approaches a man in his 60's, this is HAROLD.
FAITH
How long have you lived in the area,
Mr. Chicowski?
HAROLD
Ten years.
FAITH
And you... run a flower shop?

Laughter from all the jurors except ELI, a meek 20-something
guy who sketches the proceedings in a notebook, without ever
looking up.
LATER -- RESNICK questions a well-built man in a flannel work
shirt with three-day stubble. This is LUKE, 40's.
RESNICK
It says here your wife has primary
custody of your daughter.
LUKE
Yeah.
RESNICK
Do you mind if I ask who ended the
marriage?
JUMP CUT TO COURTNEY (30, in full make-up, revealing dress)
answering the same question from Faith later on in the day.
COURTNEY
I did.
FAITH
And why was that?
COURTNEY
He couldn't handle me.
VINCE (30's, wannabe Alpha) does a double-take. Hooked.
FAITH
Right, just so I'm clear: you were
the one who filed for divorce then?
Courtney looks away. Humiliated. Her cheeks flush with
embarrassment. That's a "no."
Faith makes a mark in her notes as Justin turns to Courtney.
JUSTIN
You okay?
Faith hears this and turns on a heel. Looks right at him.

Mr. Kemp. You're a magazine writer?
JUSTIN
That's right.
And now it's her turn to recognize him.
FAITH
What kind of articles do you write?
JUSTIN
Features mostly.
FAITH
So you write about a variety of
topics?
JUSTIN
Yes.
FAITH
Ever write about a murder trial?
JUSTIN
I write for a regional lifestyle
magazine. It's not exactly "Vanity
Fair."
Laughter from the room.
FAITH
I'll take that as a no. Being a
writer, I imagine you read a lot.
Have you read anything about this
case?
JUSTIN
Today's the first time I've heard
about it.
FAITH
Then I think you'd make a fine
member of this jury.

RESNICK
We accept him, Your Honor.
THE JUDGE
Good. Then please enter "Justin
Kemp" as Juror #2.
13 INT. KEMP HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON 13
Justin walks in the front door. Takes off his coat.
JUSTIN
Hey.
Allison, sitting on the couch, feet up, looks at him.
ALLISON
How'd it go?
JUSTIN
I got picked.
ALLISON
What happened to wildly
inappropriate?
JUSTIN
I'm saving that for you. They said
it'll be a short trial.
He sits down next to her.
ALLISON
Mmm hmm.
(looks at him)
Now answer me this truly important
question: What are we doing for
dinner?
JUSTIN
You're the boss. Any cravings?
ALLISON

She points at her feet and motions for him to rub them.
Justin knows it's the least he can do and goes to work.
14 INT. SUPERIOR COURT - COURT ROOM 304 - THE NEXT 14
MORNING
Justin sits in the jury box with the rest of the jurors we've
already met, as well as a few we'll get to know later on.
Faith stands before them, giving her OPENING STATEMENT.
FAITH
The facts of the case are these: one
year ago, on October twenty-fifth,
James Sythe and his then-girlfriend
Kendall Carter went drinking at
Rowdy's Hideaway on Old Quarry Road.
Justin raises an eyebrow -- that date and place strike a
chord.
With a remote control click, Faith puts up a picture of
Rowdy's Hideaway on a rollaway TV. This takes us to --
15 INT. ROWDY'S HIDEAWAY - NIGHT - FLASHBACK 15
The place is jamming and Sythe and KENDALL CARTER, 20's, sit
next to each other at a high-top table. They count to three
and take tequila shots.
Kendall whispers something dirty in his ear. He loves it.
But whatever she says next changes the mood on a dime.
Sythe stiffens. And Kendall does NOT like that at all. She
quickly loses her temper. Unloads on him. Over the jukebox
music, we can't hear what she's saying, but whatever it is,
she means it.
Behind them, JUSTIN sits alone in a booth, staring into his
full tumbler of bourbon, as if daring himself to take a sip.
16 INT. SUPERIOR COURT - COURT ROOM 304 - MORNING 16
Justin's wide-eyed -- I was there that night. He hangs on
Faith's every word.
FAITH
Things got tense. They had a fight.
17 INT. ROWDY'S HIDEAWAY - NIGHT - FLASHBACK 17
Sythe tries to defend himself against Kendall’s offensive.
But he is starting to lose his patiences and knocks a beer
off the table. This sets her off more.

Behind them, we see Justin push his drink away, untouched.
He gets up, walks outside. He's followed seconds later by
Kendall and Sythe as their argument spills onto the PATIO.
FAITH (V.O.)
She stormed out of the bar. He
followed her.
18 EXT. ROWDY'S HIDEAWAY - NIGHT - FLASHBACK 18
BAR PATRONS share looks as Sythe and Kendall go at it.
Beside them in the parking lot, we see Justin in his 4Runner
through the driver's side window. Head in hands. It starts
to lightly RAIN.
FAITH (V.O.)
The fight escalated and quickly got
out of control.
THUNDER crackles. The rain dumps, turning into a STORM.
From here, we'll JUMP BACK AND FORTH between the OPENING
STATEMENTS and JUSTIN'S MEMORY of the night in question.
19 INT. SUPERIOR COURT - COURT ROOM 304 - DAY 19
Back in the courtroom, we pick up Resnick giving HIS opening.
RESNICK
... This was par for the course.
They'd argue, it was "over." Then
they'd make up the next day when
they both had calmed down. It was
basically a game.
FAITH
She was serious this time. She was
DONE with him; and so she left and
headed down the road on foot...
Justin shifts in his seat. Thinking back to that night.
20 EXT. OLD QUARRY ROAD - NIGHT - FLASHBACK 20
Justin drives the 4Runner down the dark, tree-lined, two-lane
road.
PING!
A TEXT... he checks his phone... reads the message from
"ALLY" --
You ok?

21 INT. SUPERIOR COURT - COURT ROOM 304 - CONTINUOUS 21
RESNICK
This was just another typical night
of "drama", so James Sythe got in
his car and drove home.
FAITH
He flew into a violent rage and
followed Kendall Carter down the
road.
Justin winces, remembering.
22 EXT. OLD QUARRY ROAD - NIGHT - FLASHBACK 22
Justin looks back up at the road as --
WHAM!!!
In a split second --
SOMETHING appears in front of him.
THUD! It hits his hood.
His brakes SLAM. Car STOPS.
FAITH (V.O.)
And then he killed her.
JUSTIN sits there. Gasping. Heart racing as the yellow
glare in his periphery grabs his attention -- it's a sign
that reads: "DEER X-ING."
Relief and hope swell as he turns the 4Runner off and gets
out. Walks around it, looks under.
Nothing.
He goes back to the point of impact. Walks to the railing
and peers over it, but it's too dark and steep to make
anything out -- an abyss peppered with rocks.
Lightning FLASHES, illuminating his face. It jars him and he
returns to the 4Runner. Gets in as we linger outside.
The passenger side headlight is cracked, side-panel's dented,
front-end totally crumpled.
23 INT. SUPERIOR COURT - COURT ROOM 304 - CONTINUOUS 23

FAITH
He beat her viciously, pushed her
over a railing -- into the creek
below -- and left her to die.
She pulls up a CRIME SCENE PHOTO of KENDALL CARTER at the
bottom of the creek bed.
RESNICK
James Sythe didn't attack her and
couldn't have pushed her. Because
he wasn't there.
Justin stares at the photograph as the truth settles in --
THIS is who he hit. Not a deer, this girl. Kendall Carter.
And JAMES SYTHE is the one on trial. The one looking
straight ahead, eyes rife with fear.
A muffled CRY rings out through the courtroom. A smartly
dressed WOMAN wipes the tears from her eyes with her sleeve.
This is Kendall's Carter's MOTHER. Her FATHER gives Mom his
handkerchief.
Justin takes this in. Heart racing, he closes his eyes.
FAITH
James Sythe took an innocent life!
RESNICK
...James Sythe is an innocent man!
A mix of nods and skepticism from the jury. And then there's
Justin, his face sweaty, color draining. He's paralyzed.
By what he's done... and by the question of what to do now.
24 INT. SUPERIOR COURT - BATHROOM - LATER THAT DAY 24
The sound of PUKING followed by a toilet flushing. The stall
door opens and Justin exits, wipes his mouth and washes up.
And that's when he spots fellow juror Marcus two sinks down.
MARCUS
Damn, man. You all right?
JUSTIN
Those crime-scene pictures.

Never had a strong stomach.

MARCUS

25 INT. MAGAZINE OFFICES - DUSK 25
An empty bullpen. People gone for the day. One light on.
JUSTIN'S OFFICE
Small with a view of downtown. There's a JOURNALISM AWARD on
his desk beside a framed photo of him and Allison, as well as
a group picture of the YOUTH LACROSSE TEAM he coaches.
His computer's open to a newspaper article on the Sythe case.
He pulls up his CALENDAR and clicks back to OCTOBER 25, 2021.
The whole day is blocked off in green. It says: "Due Date!"
Justin bites his lip. Seeing this brings back memories.
Then he opens a new window, types "Vehicular Homicide" into
Google.
CUSTODIAN
Working late?
Startled, Justin shuts his open windows and turns to see the
CUSTODIAN smiling at him.
JUSTIN
I'll be out of your way in a minute.
CUSTODIAN
Take as long as you want. I'll come
back.
(Justin nods)
Thanks again for those tickets.
My son and I had a great time.
JUSTIN
Glad to hear it.
The Custodian continues on his way. That was a close call.
He shuts off his computer, grabs his jacket and leaves.
26 INT. SAINT MARIA CHURCH - NIGHT 26
LARRY LASKER (50's, eyes that see all and give nothing) leads

I can tell. Do you want to talk
about it?
Justin doesn't even know how to begin.
LARRY (CONT’D)
Whatever it is, my advice will be
the same.
Justin just looks at him. He's stricken.
LARRY (CONT’D)
You know what to do. We’re only as
sick as our secrets.
Justin takes this in, nods his head in acknowledgement.
Turns around and walks out. Larry watches him go.
27 EXT/INT. DOWNTOWN POLICE STATION - NIGHT 27
Justin takes a deep breath, enters. A long, cold hallway
leads to a VISITOR'S WINDOW. He approaches a DESK COP.
JUSTIN
I need to speak with a detective.
BELEAGURED DESK COP
Regarding?
JUSTIN
Reporting a crime.
The Desk Cop hands Justin a clipboard with a FORM attached.

Justin takes the clipboard, sits down in a WAITING AREA.
He looks around -- two PROSTITUTES play on their phones and a
METH HEAD picks at his face while they wait for someone to be
released.
Justin fills out the form -- name, address, etc -- hesitating
when he gets to the "Details of incident you are reporting".
He looks over as TWO COPS push a HANDCUFFED GUY through the
waiting area, past the front desk, to the INTERVIEW ROOMS.
PROSTITUTE #1
Don't say shit without a lawyer
there!
PROSTITUTE #2
These people ain't your friends, yo!
Justin's phone buzzes. A TEXT from "ALLY" pops up.
How's it going?
Buzz.
We miss you.
Buzz. A PICTURE comes through on text of a meme of a
pregnant belly with a hand-drawn loading bar that reads: "90%
complete".
Justin smiles. And swallows hard.
A DETECTIVE approaches. Justin’s gone and an empty clipboard
where he was seated.

The HIKER on the stand now. Taking us through his POV.
HIKER
... Because of the rain the night

Quarry by the bridge in order to get
back to the road.
37 EXT. WOODS - DAY 37
The HIKER moves through the trees slowly navigating the slick
hillside one step and a time.
He's in the creek bed now. He walks forward, stopping as he
sees Kendall Carter caught on some rocks -- a lifeless,
crumpled mass of jeans and heels.
He gags, nearly pukes, but holds it together.
It's eerily calm and quiet as he looks around, trying to get
his composure back.

And just to be clear, when you found
Kendall Carter, she was dead?

Yes, sir. Twice a week at least.

Yes.

I assume you wear hiking boots when
you hike, Mr. Reed, is that right?

Of course.
Resnick goes to the defense table and grabs a photograph.

TIGHT ON a crime scene photo on the TV of the discovery point
of Kendall Carter's body at the bottom of the bridge.
From the witness stand, THE MEDICAL EXAMINER clicks the next
slide. An AUTOPSY SKETCH detailing Kendall's broken bones.
MEDICAL EXAMINER
The body was found lying in the
posterior position, which suggests
she was pushed as opposed to a fall.
Rigor-mortis indicated the victim
had been dead for around nine hours.
FAITH
And the cause of death?
MEDICAL EXAMINER
The severity of her skull fractures
suggest she was struck with a non￾specific blunt instrument.

his hand, covering his face. To the observer, he looks

Elderly Man scrunches his nose and brow, thinking back to

Looking across at the road. Through the tree branches, on
either side of his house, it's a narrow field of vision. And
with the rain coming down it's slightly blurred, but there he

I ordered a drink. And I sat there

left. When I got to my car, it was
raining. I turned back onto Old
Quarry, and went about a quarter of
a mile when I hit something. I got
out of the car, looked around,
didn't see anything and figured it
must've been a deer that ran off.
Then I got back in the car and drove
home.
LARRY
So, what's the problem?

Kendall Carter case. They found her
body in a creek bed about a quarter

Your previous DUI’s and the fact
that you were at a bar gives the

First Degree Vehicular Homicide and
maybe Felony Murder. That’s 30 years

not always being the greatest
boyfriend? Sure. Of not moving
forward as fast as she wanted to
because I was stupid? Absolutely.
But I'd never hurt her. I loved
Kendall with all my heart. And I
know what you see when you look at
me. But I left that life behind.
I'm not that guy anymore.

Lawyer didn't prove he was innocent.
JUSTIN
He doesn't have to. The "burden of
proof" is on the prosecution. Does
anyone have even the slightest
hesitation that James Sythe is
guilty?
He looks at Yolanda. She hesitates.
JUSTIN (CONT’D)
If you have to think, you're aren't
sure.
YOLANDA
What I'm sure of is I got three kids
to get home to!
JUSTIN
We all have lives. None of us want

Marcus eyeballs him. Denice sees this, interjects.

MARCUS
You want to be able to go home to

‘em: “We did right by that boy. We
gave him a fair shake, just like
anyone else.”
LUKE
Whoa, hold up --

Hold up? You better back up, boy.
Nellie whistles through her teeth. Everyone STOPS.
NELLIE
(sweet but firm)
That's enough. Both of you.
(to Justin)
Please continue, Mr. Kemp.
JUSTIN
Thank you, Ma'am. All I'm trying to
say is: Let's put everything else
aside for a minute and remember two
key points: 1) Sythe went to trial
instead of taking a plea. And 2)
He testified instead of taking the
fifth. Now, that doesn't mean he's
innocent. But I think he's earned a
few hours of our time to be sure.
Nods and murmurs. Denice, the forewoman steps in.
DENICE
He's right. We should go over it.

52 EXT. SUPERIOR COURT BUILDING / STEPS - DAY 52
Faith's post-trial press conference on the courthouse steps.
FAITH
The state has the truth on its side;
James Sythe is going to pay for what
he did. I WILL get justice for
Kendall Carter and for every woman
who's a victim of domestic abuse.
REPORTER
How do you feel about the latest
polling that a verdict in the Sythe
trial carries a five-point swing?
FAITH
Come on, you know I can’t comment

Faith walks off to end the conference.
53 INT. SUPERIOR COURT - DELIBERATION ROOM - DAY 53
Denice writes "WITNESS LIST" on one side of the dry-erase
board and "EVIDENCE" on the other. Turns to the jury.
DENICE
Let's start with the most damning
stuff: the eyewitness who saw Sythe
on the road, at the railing,
directly above where Kendall's body
was found.
MARCUS
Exactly. What's left to talk about?
JUSTIN
Now, hold on. The witness was a few
hundred feet away, looking from
across the bridge. In the middle of
the night, through pouring rain.

It's his testimony! He's got no
reason to lie. To question him
means we think he's lying. You
think that?
JUSTIN
No.
YOLANDA
So what the hell are we talking
about?
JUSTIN
I'm just saying the man saw somebody
at that railing, right? Can we all
agree on that?
Murmurs of "yes" and "mmm hmm."
JUSTIN (CONT’D)
So, isn't it possible that he saw
someone other than James Sythe?
YOLANDA
We could sit around all day talking
about what's "possible."
JUSTIN
I think we should.
DENICE
No. We should weigh the facts.
HAROLD
All right, fact: Thirty-two percent
of all homicides occur between
domestic partners. Fact: the police
arrested James Sythe two days after
finding the body. Fact: they never
questioned any other suspects.

HAROLD
I was. Robbery/homicide. 22 years.

Took a buyout. Left those brutal

DENICE
Why didn't you tell the lawyers?
HAROLD
They never asked.
NELLIE
Well how about that? Their mistake
is our gain. What are you thinking,
officer?
HAROLD
Detective. It seems to me like the
police followed the evidence, found
their guy and built their case.
YOLANDA
So, what's wrong with that?
HAROLD
Nothing. But "tunnel vision" can
bite you in the ass. They feed
Sythe to the Old Man and of course
that's who he ID's. So now they're
sure they've got their guy and they
ignore anything that doesn't help
their case. They stop asking
questions.

"blunt instrument" murder weapon

The prosecutor said they "couldn't

So, he got rid of it. Easy to do.
COURTNEY
Or, she was killed by something

The ground was slippery, we know

NELLIE
Wandering in the dark in heels.
Kids today.
KEIKO
It explains how she could’ve ended

MARCUS
So Sythe mowed her down instead of
bashing her head in. What
difference does it make? Guy's a
piece of shit.
HAROLD
My gut says he's not a killer.
MARCUS
You just voted "guilty!"
HAROLD
I never said he was guilty. I said
he should've taken a plea bargain.
His case was weak.
YOLANDA
Maybe there's a reason for that.
HAROLD
It's called a public defender. And
the guy seemed all right, don't get
me wrong. But he's working ten

Justin watching him from across the road, in the 4Runner.
It’s parked in the ELDERLY MAN’S driveway.
He sees Harold looking at the bridge. Then over at the
ELDERLY MAN'S HOUSE looking across Old Quarry Road. As if
he's trying to approximate making an ID from there.
Harold steps forward into the road, to get a bigger
perspective. Sees the DEER X-ING sign. Takes this in.
He stands there, observing, making mental notes when --
Justin's PHONE RINGS --
Shit. Justin sends it to voicemail, slides down in his seat,
out of sight.
But Harold hears it and turns in the direction of the noise.
All he sees are some parked cars. So he shakes it off as HIS
phone rings. Answers it.
HAROLD
Heading back to the shop now, hon...
Harold gets in his van and drives away, turns and looks RIGHT

I do anything wrong?
ALLISON
If no one gets hurt, then no. I

HAROLD
(nods, then)
You got this case all wrong.
FAITH
Really.
HAROLD
It was a hit and run.
FAITH
No way. M.E. would've flagged it.
HAROLD
You'd think. But he did five
autopsies that day. I checked.
FAITH
(shit)
Doesn't mean anything.
HAROLD
Let me ask you something: Did you
look at ANY other suspects besides
James Sythe?
FAITH
We did our job.
HAROLD
If you'd done your job, we wouldn't
be standing here right now.
A well-placed arrow. Knocks Faith on her heels.
FAITH
The guy's bad news.
HAROLD
Maybe. Doesn’t mean he killed his
girlfriend.

MARCUS
So what was this "misconduct?"
JUSTIN
That's between him and the Judge.
YOLANDA
Bullshit. You were there.

He was playing out a hit and run.
She looks up from Kendall Carter's autopsy file.
66 INT. FAITH'S DEPUTY DA OFFICE - DAY 66
Faith's at her desk, focused. She looks up from her copy of
Harold's confiscated folder.
She types a name from the list into a LexisNexis search. The
name's address and place of work come up. She scribbles them
down on a legal pad. Types in the next name on the list.
67 INT. SUPERIOR COURT - DELIBERATION ROOM - LATER THAT 67
DAY
Keiko walks the jury through what she's thinking.
KEIKO
Kendall was 5'5. If she was hunched
over and the car was an SUV or a
truck, she could've easily been hit
smack across the head and torso.
(holds up the autopsy)
Look at the way her shoulders are
fractured...
This line of thought cuts too close for Justin.
JUSTIN
I'm sorry, are you a doctor?
KEIKO
Not yet. 3rd-year med student.

Keiko holds up an X-RAY to illustrate her point.
KEIKO
The right and left clavicle both

It's not likely. Both bones had to
be broken by a single, sharp,
posterior impact. POW!!!
She SMACKS the table. Justin recoils.
IRENE
Do we know if Sythe's car had any

JUSTIN
The police would've noted it in

Good, because we're not here to

James Sythe killed Kendall Carter.
He looks around the room. Keiko meets his eyes.
KEIKO
I'm not. Old Quarry Road feeds into
the highway. When traffic's heavy,

Justin's nodding without realizing it.
MARCUS
So why didn't the defense bring up
any of that during the trial?
NELLIE
Maybe it never crossed their mind.
I mean, it only just occurred to us.

That's a great point. Maybe the

She steps out on the ROAD. Measures the distance in her head

And then she looks OVER IT.
She winces, imagining it. Dazed, she turns back, steps on to

school. Two years in, he was making
more money on those corners than
I'll ever see in my lifetime.

Month before his seventeenth

Part of my sentence was community
service. I spent three days a week

He gets out of the car. Shuts the driver's side door. The
HUMMING of the engine cooling down grabs his attention.
He looks at the hood and then kneels down and runs his hand
along the front quarter-panel onto the grille and bumper.
Feeling EYES on him, he rises and turns around to see Allison
standing in the doorway between the garage and the house.
JUSTIN
Ally, hey.
(reading her)
Everything all right?
ALLISON
Whatcha doing?
JUSTIN
Nothing. Just inspecting the car.
She enters the garage. But she's still blocking Justin's
pathway back into their house.
ALLISON
Where'd you hit that deer again?
Brimstone Pass?
JUSTIN
Yeah.
ALLISON
You sure it wasn't Old Quarry Road?
JUSTIN
Positive.

That's exactly what I said when the

interrogated me in our living room.
JUSTIN
What...?
ALLISON
I looked her up. She wanted to know
about your accident.
JUSTIN
(thrown)
Why would she want to know about
that?
ALLISON
She said she's looking into a
possible hit and run.
Shit. He tries to remain calm.
JUSTIN
Okay... And what did you tell her?
ALLISON
The truth. You hit a deer up on
Brimstone Pass.
JUSTIN
Good.
ALLISON
That is the truth, right...?
JUSTIN
Ally...
ALLISON
You took the shortcut home through
Old Quarry that night, didn't you?
Silence. Her face falls.

Yeah.

ALLISON
Why should I believe that?
JUSTIN
Because it's the truth. It was
their due date. And I couldn't deal
with it. The feelings I was
having... I couldn't bring that into
our home, to put that on you. So, I
went somewhere else.
ALLISON
You could've talked to me.
JUSTIN
No.
(the hard truth)
You were in too much pain already.
It crushes her to hear that. Tears welling now.
ALLISON
I was lost. I kept thinking that
somehow I was responsible for what
happened.
JUSTIN
No...
ALLISON
They were my babies.
And there it is. It was twins that they lost.
JUSTIN
Ally...
She bites her lip to stop it from quivering.
JUSTIN (CONT’D)

He takes this in. Making a decision in this moment.

They embrace.

Faith pulls up. Resnick is waiting for her.
RESNICK
What the hell is this about?
FAITH
I need to see him.
RESNICK
Really? For what possible reason?
FAITH
So he can look me in the eye and say
he didn't do it.
RESNICK
So, I’m right. You have doubt.

SYTHE
I shouldn't be talking to you.
Resnick nods “it’s okay” to his client.
He sits.
SYTHE (CONT’D)
Okay, What do you want?
FAITH
Same thing as you. Justice for
Kendall Carter.
SYTHE
Then go find the guy who did it.
FAITH
No jury, no Judge, no cameras. Tell
me what happened that night.
SYTHE
I told you. I went home.
FAITH
But first you followed her, right?
SYTHE
She was wasted.
FAITH
And you were angry and sick of
getting played.
SYTHE
It wasn’t like that. She just
needed to Chill out. That’s how
“Kenny” was. She’d get all worked

I've done a lot of things in my life
I'm not proud of. But I didn't do

is not going after Kendall in my car
that night. Because if I had, she'd

He stands up. Looks to Resnick.
SYTHE (CONT’D)
I’m done here.
Pounds on the door to summon the GUARD.
Faith watches them lead Sythe away as we CUT TO:
82 EXT. CITY HALL - PARKING LOT - MORNING 82
The jurors board the bus. The Bailiff checks them in.
83 INT. COUNTY BUS - FREEWAY - DAY 83
Moving around the bus we see: Keiko chatting with Nellie; Eli
sketching; Vince and Courtney sitting next to each other.
Irene twirling her hair. Brody takes a nap. And Justin looks
out the window, unaware Marcus is watching him.
84 INT. ROWDY'S HIDEAWAY - DAY 84
The jury does a walk-through, taking in the atmosphere.
They pass the high-top table where James and Kendall sat.
Brody picks up a salt shaker, inspects it for some unknown
reason (he’s baked.)
BAILIFF
Look but don’t touch.
He puts it back. Justin takes in the place. He looks at the
bar, then to the booth he was sitting at on October 25.

Sitting in that booth. Staring at the tumbler of bourbon
before him. Eyes red, heart heavy. A shell of a man.
He reaches for the drink. Just feeling the glass in his hand
sends a jolt through his system. He comes alive. The
bourbon like a siren calling.
But then with whatever strength he has left, he pushes the
glass AWAY. Stands. He needs to get out of here. NOW.
And does. He rushes past Sythe and Kendall as they yell at
each other.
BACK TO SCENE
86 INT. ROWDY'S HIDEAWAY - DAY 86
The jury finishes their "tour" of Rowdy’s.
BAILIFF
Ok, we all done in here?
DENICE
Everyone good?
Denice leads the jury outside. The BARTENDER (who testified
at trial) stacks glasses for the evening shift. She catches
Justin's eye as he passes by, shoots him a nod of
recognition.
Justin nods back at her to be polite. Which Marcus notices.
As does Faith, who hangs back with Resnick and the Bailiff,
monitoring things from afar. But doesn't think much of it.
87 EXT. ROWDY'S HIDEAWAY - DAY 87
The jurors walk around the outside of the bar, surveying the
crime scene.
DENICE

That's where Sythe and Kendall
fought.
Justin takes it in, looking past the patio to the lot where
his 4Runner was parked on October 25th.

He reaches down to pick it up. Sits back upright and catches
his reflection in the rearview mirror. Sees the hurt in his
own eyes.
In the safety of his car now, he lets his emotions go. He
POUNDS the steering wheel in frustration, anger and pain.
Outside, RAIN comes down. Justin takes a deep breath, steels
himself and starts the car.
89 EXT. ROWDY'S HIDEAWAY - DAY 89
Justin steadies himself as Denice leads the jury to the road.
Faith, Resnick and Sythe with Sheriff’s deputies stay behind
as the jury moves ahead.
DENICE

COURTNEY
And then he follows her.

This is where it happened.

Justin at the wheel of the 4Runner, exits Rowdy’s parking lot
onto Old Quarry Road.
Justin sees a car pull in front of him at Mile Marker 217.
92 EXT. OLD QUARRY ROAD - CRIME SCENE - DAY 92
Justin SWEATS. Pulse racing. He turns his AA coin over in

JUSTIN
I don't know what you mean.
Marcus gets next to Justin, so he can speak under his breath
without attracting too much attention.
MARCUS
The day you got on the jury, you're
puking in the bathroom. All that
stuff with the flower-man-cop and
those papers. You claim to be the
voice of reason, but you're really
just telling us what we wanna hear.
CLINK! Justin's coin slips out of his hand and hits the
gravel. Marcus locks in on it as Justin picks it back up.
MARCUS (CONT’D)
I saw the Bartender back there look
at you. She knows you. I don't
know your game, man. But I see you.
Justin looks away. Sees Yolanda survey the side of the road,
testing her footing. Keiko counts her steps to end of
bridge.
MARCUS (CONT’D)
Do I know exactly what happened that
night? No. But neither do you. You
can't be any more sure that James
Sythe got in his car and drove home
than I'm sure he picked up one of
these rocks, smashed that poor
girl's head in and dumped her body
in the creek.
He picks up a large rock and tosses it over the edge.
Watches it drop into the creek.
It hits the water with a SPLASH. Its ripples MORPHING into
Kendall Carter's face in Justin's mind.
It shocks his system and he goes limp -- like he's out of
body -- and nearly TOPPLES over the edge himself, only for
Marcus to GRAB HIM by the jacket to pull him back.
MARCUS (CONT’D)

MARCUS (CONT’D)
That piece of shit left her there
that night. To die alone, in a
ditch. Her death's on him. Which
is why I will not acquit James
Sythe. Ever.
ON JUSTIN --
His mind races. What to do? How can I get out of this?
MARCUS (CONT’D)
This trial only ends two ways: with
a conviction or a hung jury.
Justin turns as Denice and the rest of the jurors approach.
DENICE
Are you okay?
JUSTIN
Yeah. Fine. Thanks.
DENICE
Good. Everyone ready to head back?
Nods and murmurs of "yes." Denice motions to the Bailiff,
who nods and radios it in.
Beside her, Faith scans the home across Old Quarry Road.
Sees the drapes move in the window of the ELDERLY MAN'S HOME.
Sythe is put into an unmarked car. He looks at the jury,
stoic, holding it in. Clearly being back here is emotional
for him.
And for them. They return his look as the car door shuts
behind him. The cruiser drives off and flips a U-turn.

And it passes the other way, Justin sees James Sythe behind
the wheel.
Justin keeps driving, past Mile Marker 217. The rain's
DUMPING now so he cranks the windshield wipers to maximum
speed, but it's still a fight to see anything until the DEER
X-ING sign comes into view and --
PING!
Justin gets a TEXT... reaches for his cell... reads the text

The Elderly Man refills Faith's cup of tea. They sit in his
living room, discussing his testimony.
ELDERLY MAN
... It's like I said at the trial.
The police came over and showed me a
picture. Asked if he was the man I
saw that night.
FAITH
Did they show you any other
pictures?
ELDERLY MAN
Oh no, they knew it was him. They
just wanted me to confirm it.

They share a look. Faith leaves.
96 INT. SUPERIOR COURT - COURT ROOM 304 - DAY 96
Judge Stewart enters. The Bailiff stands to announce her.
Everyone in the courtroom rises. Resnick and Sythe on the
defense side. Resnick looks to the prosecution's table.
Faith's ASSOCIATES are seated but her lead counsel's chair is
EMPTY.
But then, in the nick of time she enters the courtroom and
slides into her seat, out of breath. Smooths out her blouse.
To her right, THE JURY. We move across their faces -- stoic,
nervous, antsy, scared -- until we arrive at one EMPTY SEAT.

Dated and signed this day, Denice
Aldworth, foreperson.
Sythe goes numb, legs buckling. Resnick has to hold him up.
Faith's Associates pump their fists under the table, trying
to celebrate inconspicuously. She just sits there, unsure
how to feel.
Judge Stewart turns to Denice in the jury box.

And Justin. He sits alone, somber. Watches the proceedings.
There's a lull in the action as the Judge has a side-bar
conversation with The Bailiff.
Faith uses this time-out to open the card that came with the
flowers. Personal stationery with a short, simple note.
"Thank you for bringing us peace. And finding justice for

possibility of parole...
Cries and groans throughout the gallery. Sythe just sits
there, a broken man. His eyes are blank. No fight left.
Faith glances at him, takes this in and immediately looks
away --
Her eyes landing ON JUSTIN. His face pale and anguished.
This is a stronger reaction than she'd expect from a juror.
From the only one who bothered to show up, no less.
And that's when something dawns on her. Holy. Shit.
She takes out her phone, holds it under the table and types
"Allison Crewson husband" into the search engine.

The defendant is remanded to the
custody of the Department of
Corrections to serve the rest of his
life in prison. This court is now

JUSTIN (CONT’D)
Thank you.
The door chimes as he exits. Just as a light from the back
turns off. HAROLD comes out keys in hand ready to close up.
HAROLD
Come on lets get out of here honey.
The kids are coming over tonight.
Harold grabs his wife's hand to head out for the evening.
113 EXT. CREST LAWN MEMORIAL CEMETERY - DAY 113
Justin lays the flowers down in front of a headstone. The
inscription reads:
KENDALL ALICE CARTER
April 6, 1999 - October 25, 2021
"OUR DAUGHTER"
He bows his head. Closes his eyes. Says a silent prayer.
114 EXT. CREST LAWN MEMORIAL CEMETERY - DAY 114
Justin walks past a GROUNDSKEEPER raking the leaves on his
way to the parking lot.
GROUNDSKEEPER
Looks like it's gonna rain.
He looks up at the sky. Then back at The Groundskeeper.
JUSTIN
I think the storm has passed.
And with that rain will come Justin's proverbial baptism.
His new life. He hopes.
He walks away as dark clouds move in on the horizon.
115 EXT. CITY HALL - PARKING LOT - MORNING 115
Faith parks. The SIGN before it reads:
RESERVED - F. KILLEBREW
DISTRICT ATTORNEY
She shuts the engine off. Checks herself out in the mirror.

She takes a deep breath, psyching herself up for her first
day in her new role. Opens her car door as we CUT TO:
116 INT. FAITH'S FANCY NEW D.A. OFFICE - DAY 116
Boxes and file crates everywhere. Faith at her desk, staring
into nothing. Thinking.
She's so lost in thought she doesn't notice RESNICK enter.
He hands her a PLANT.
RESNICK
For the new digs.
FAITH
Thanks.
She sets it down as he looks around the office.
RESNICK
Well, you did it.
(a well-placed
arrow)
Hope it was worth it.
This hangs. He turns to go.
RESNICK (CONT’D)
Ale House later. You're buying.
He leaves. Faith sits, weighed down by the burden of her
conscience.
117 EXT. KEMP HOUSE - ESTABLISHING - AFTERNOON 117
Drop down from a cloudless, vibrant Autumn sky onto Justin
and Allison's home.
118 INT. KEMP HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON 118
The sound of the front door closing precedes Justin entering
the living room where Allison and the Baby lie on a blanket.
JUSTIN
And the 4Runner is officially sold.
He holds up a CHECK. Allison smiles, motions to him.
ALLISON
Get over here. We just started.
JUSTIN
Yes, Ma'am. I love me some "tummy￾time."

He lies down beside Allison, with the Baby between them.
Allison shakes a rattle to get the Baby's attention.
ALLISON
I think she has my eyes.
JUSTIN
Really? I think she has mine.
ALLISON
She has your elbows.
He laughs. Leans over so he can see the Baby's face.
JUSTIN
My mouth! She has my mouth.
ALLISON
Let's hope not.
They're both laughing now. Basking in this moment. The
three of them, lying on the floor, together. A family.
Justin leans over and gives Allison a kiss. Lifts the Baby
up and gives her one, too.
JUSTIN
My girls.
It's perfect. His heart is full. Of happiness. And
gratitude. He could stay like this forever, except --
They're interrupted by a loud KNOCK at the door.
JUSTIN (CONT’D)
I'll get it.
Justin hops to his feet and goes to the front door. He
unbolts the deadlock.
He takes a moment to compose himself. Looks back one more
time at his wife and child. And then he turns the handle,
pulling open the door to reveal FAITH there.
She looks at him. He looks at her. Her glance is unwavering
but his eyes give her nothing. There's a long silence
between them, as they prepare to cross the point of no return
and we --
BLACKOUT:
THE END
