WHAT YOU'RE ABOUT TO SEE IS A SOMEWHAT TRUE STORY INSPIRED BY
THE LIFE OF GARY JOHNSON
INT. LECTURE HALL - DAY1 1
GARY is in front of his students, giving them a lecture about
the philosophical basis of living a passionate, active life,
rather than a passive one.
GARY
What does Nietzsche mean when he
says, "The secret for harvesting
from existence the greatest
fruitfulness and the greatest
enjoyment is to LIVE DANGEROUSLY!
Build your cities on the slopes of
Vesuvius! Send your ships into
uncharted seas! Live at war with
your peers and yourselves!" What's
he getting at here? Anybody?
A student, SYLVIA, raises their hand.
GARY (CONT’D)
Sylvia.
SYLVIA
Sounds like he's saying you gotta
put yourself out there, you have to
take risks and get out of your
comfort zone because life is short -
you have to live passionately, and
on your own terms.
GARY
Well, I have a three-word response
to that. Ab-so-lutely.
A STUDENT sitting in the back of the class whispers to the
student sitting next to him:
STUDENT
Says the guy driving the Civic.
EXT./INT. NEW ORLEANS - DAY2 2
Gary's drive home in his Civic.
2.
INT. GARY'S HOUSE - EVENING3 3
We go INSIDE. The atmosphere is one of a cluttered brain.
As we hear Gary's voice-over, we see his routine:
-Gary waters his plants, meticulously, spraying leaves, etc.
-Amongst various bird illustrations, posters, and sighting
logs, Gary fills the different feeders with the right mix of
birdseed.
-He dishes out food for his cats in bowls labeled "ID" and
"EGO." Soon they are all silently eating together.
GARY (V.O.)
I know on the surface my life looks
simple, a little plain. A guy
feeding birds and living alone with
his cats in the suburbs, but I
liked my inner life. I was pretty
happy - at least content.
-Gary grades papers, works on an upcoming lecture, rehearses
sections for Id and Ego.
Gary's bookshelf includes: "The Complete Works of
Shakespeare"... "The Chemistry of Consciousness"... lots of
Jung...
GARY (V.O.)
Oh, by the way, my name is Gary
Johnson and for a few years I'd
been teaching psychology and
philosophy classes at The
University of New Orleans. While
I'd always enjoyed living in a
world of questions and ideas, I
also had a flair for all things
electronic and digital and found
myself supplementing my income by
working part time undercover with
the New Orleans Police Department.
Nothing shakes Gary from his routine.
INT. POLICE STATION - DAY4 4
Gary walks into the police station.
2.
3.
INT. GUN RANGE5 5
BANG! BANG! We see Gary practice at a gun range.
GARY (V.O.)
After some obligatory training, I
was soon hiding cameras, mics, and
getting good at recordings, mostly
in murder-for-hire cases.
EXT. PHO BANG RESTAURANT PARKING LOT - DAY6 6
We now see a run-down Vietnamese Food joint in a low rent
strip mall. Down the alley beside the restaurant, and in the
back, we find a CAR and a VAN.
GARY (V.O.)
What can I say? I was minding my
own business when my life took the
oddest of turns.
INT. POLICE SURVEILLANCE VAN - DAY7 7
Inside the secret surveillance control room, we see Gary, his
eyes locked on a monitor, fingers dancing between tapping
keys and adjusting levels. He masterfully controls a joystick
that zooms in on an EMPTY TABLE. His cohort PHIL looks
through a file.
PHIL
Jasper better watch his ass with
this Craig guy.
Several assault charges, possession...
Suddenly, the door opens and DETECTIVE CLAUDETTE looks in.
CLAUDETTE
Hey, Gary...
CLAUDETTE (CONT’D)
Look, we just heard - Jasper can't
go in. Chief officially suspended
him for those teenagers he jacked
up.
PHIL
Finally...
CLAUDETTE
Anyway, we're thinking you're up.
3.
4.
GARY
I'm up? What is "up"?
CLAUDETTE
Congrats, Gary, you just got
promoted to contract killer.
Gary puts it together. Doesn't like the picture.
GARY
We reschedule - he's not even here
yet.
CLAUDETTE
Hitmen don't cancel the first
meeting.
GARY
Hitmen don't exist. What, are we
following made-up rules now?
PHIL
You've seen this a million times -
you can do it.
GARY
Why don't you do it?
PHIL
No way. Tried years ago - almost
got killed.
GARY
Well, I don't want to almost get
killed either. I'm a civilian.
PHIL
We got your back. We'll move in if
it starts getting pear-shaped.
CLAUDETTE
Clock's ticking - and you need to
get Jasper's wire.
Phil smacks a file into Gary's chest.
PHIL
And you might want to check this
out real quick. It's everything we
know so far, Billy.
GARY
What?
4.
5.
CLAUDETTE
Your alias: "Billy." Let's go.
GARY (V.O.)
Oh my God, I'm gonna die.
INT. JASPER'S CAR - DAY8 8
Gary gets in the passenger seat. Jasper is silent and
smoldering as he glares at his replacement.
JASPER
...What a bunch of cancel culture
bullshit...
GARY
I'm sorry about this, Jasper.
Claude sent me to...
JASPER
You know, A LOT of people are fine
with what I did, given the
circumstances, they actually had no
problem with it. If you read the
comment section, it's like two-to-
one my side.
GARY
Sucks...
JASPER
Fuck 'em. Fuck 'em. 120 day
suspension, WITH PAY. Fuck. Fuckin'
fine with me - I'm going fishin',
motherfuckers. I'll spend the whole
summer in Pensacola. See how
everyone around here does without
me... and why are you in my car?
GARY
Uh, Claude said to get your mic and
transmitter.
Jasper seems annoyed but starts to take it off.
JASPER
So, who's going in my place?
Gary looks at him blankly... points to himself.
JASPER (CONT’D)
You? Oh...
5.
6.
GARY
Right? I feel like there are better
candidates.
JASPER
Yeah, yeah. Eh, makes sense - you
got this unreadable face, perfectly
forgettable.
GARY
I know...so, I've been listening in
on these for a while, I kinda know
what to say, but... any wisdom? Or
tricks?
JASPER
Bottom line - they gotta believe
it. They want you to be this
killer, so you gotta be that - you
can't show any weakness. It's
constant aggression until you hear
the words out of their mouth.
GARY
Got it.
JASPER
But you gotta be relaxed... easy-
breezy...
GARY
Alright, so, I'm looking for --
Jasper's phone rings. He holds it out, puts it on speaker.
JASPER
Your job is to put these assholes
in prison... what's up, Claude?
CLAUDETTE
(over speaker phone)
New Billy's got to make moves.
Craig's here.
JASPER
Alright.
GARY
Oh, man...
Go time. Gary glances over to Jasper in a bit of a panic.
6.
7.
JASPER
You only get one first impression.
Don't fuck it up.
(points to shorts)
You're not wearing those in there,
are you?
EXT. POLICE SURVEILLANCE VAN - MOMENTS LATER9 9
Gary and Phil both in their undies, trading pants in the
confines of the van.
PHIL
Honestly, these are pretty good,
man.
GARY
They breathe really well.
PHIL
Yeah.
(Phil kicks)
Hah!
EXT. ALLEY - MINUTES LATER10 10
Gary in Phil's pants is walking slowly toward the restaurant
along the side of the building, psyching himself up,
summoning an intensity we haven't seen (and maybe neither has
Gary).
GARY
You're Billy. You're a killer! You
kill for a living!
INT. POLICE RENTAL CAR11 11
We see Phil watching the surveillance video of the restaurant
on the monitor.
INT. PHO BANG DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS12 12
Gary walks in determined, another person, crackling with new
energy. CRAIG sits across the mostly empty room, checking his
watch, impatient.
GARY
(On monitor)
Grab your shit. Sit down.
7.
8.
Craig complies, following Gary over to another table. Gary
looks right down the barrel of a HIDDEN CAMERA for approval.
IN THE RESTAURANT
GARY
Listen, this whole thing has got to
be based on trust.
CRAIG
Yeah, man. No shit. So, how long
you been doin' this?
Gary slams the table.
GARY
Now, THAT'S none of your FUCKIN'
BUSINESS!
IN THE VAN
CLAUDETTE
Oh, shit! Look at Gary.
PHIL
The man is a natural.
CLAUDETTE
Playing some offense here.
IN THE RESTAURANT
Gary throttles back a little bit, becomes a bit more
reasonable.
GARY
You called me to do a job. You
don't know me, I don't know you,
and at some point in the future,
that's going to be a good thing.
We're not going to be friends, you
got it?
CRAIG
Got it.
Suddenly, Gary goes blank, not knowing what to say next,
making for an uncomfortable pause.
GARY (V.O.)
Breathe... think...hitman thoughts.
8.
9.
CRAIG
Soo...
GARY
Sooo... you're assessing me.
(gathers steam)
Am I the right guy to eliminate
your problem? And, just so you
know, I'm assessing you too - are
you full of shit? Some big talker
who's not serious? And if you're
serious now, are you going to one
day find Jesus and be so
overburdened by guilt and remorse
and confess your sins? Are you
going to break under pressure,
Craig, and point a fucking finger
at me?
CRAIG
Never! Fuck, man, never. In fact, I
got it all worked out already.
GARY
Okay, let's hear it.
CRAIG
I work a seven and seven, so
starting this coming Tuesday, which
is crew-change day outta Houma,
every second of my whereabouts is
documented and accounted for. That
way, anything bad were to happen,
no one can think I did it, right?
Not Craig, nuh uh, cause Craig is
out on an oil rig, isn't he? A
hundred and twenty miles out in the
Gulf the whole time. Whatchu think
about that?
GARY
That's a good plan. Alright, then
I'd say Thursday or Friday is
probably the best time.
CRAIG
Sounds good.
GARY
So, what are you thinking exactly?
CRAIG
Uh, you know, just take care of
'em?
9.
10.
GARY
What does that mean exactly?
CRAIG
C'mon, man. You know what it means.
He just needs to just go away for
good.
GARY
So, what's your proximity
afterwards?
CRAIG
What do you mean?
GARY
You going to the funeral?
CRAIG
Funeral? Uh, in my ideal world,
there wouldn't have to be a
funeral, would there?
GARY
So, no funeral?
CRAIG
Dude, I'm sorry, are we actually
talking about the same thing here?
IN THE VAN
Claudette glued to monitor.
CLAUDETTE
Oh boy... going off the rails here.
C'mon... let's get back on track,
Gary.
IN THE BOOTH
Gary finds a new tactic - doubles down.
GARY
The reason I'm asking, is because
it sounds like to me you're talking
about the disposal of a body, which
is more risky for me.
CRAIG
Gotcha...
10.
(MORE)
11.
GARY
A faked suicide or botched robbery,
I'm in and out. What you're talking
about requires me to spend a lot of
time with the body, to make sure
it's never discovered.
CRAIG
Right... and I'm just curious...
How you do that?
GARY
Look, I'll let you in on a few of
my secrets. I got different ways,
but in this case I'll probably go
full on - separate the head from
the body and do what I call a bayou
burial. You know the Bayou Gauche?
CRAIG
Sure do...
GARY
Well, my family has land out there,
so, late at night, I'll drift in
undetected, drift out in a little
boat, and let the alligators take
it from there.
CRAIG
(slightly confused)
Now, we talking about the body, or
the head?
GARY
Body. Head... Head is a different
story. Head means teeth. And teeth
are a fuckin' problem.
CRAIG
Dental records, right? Okay. So,
what do you do about that?
GARY
Well, I find a spot in the middle
of nowhere, a stick of dynamite in
the mouth...BOOM. No more teeth, no
more problem.
CRAIG
Just blow that fucker up, huh? God
damn. Wow.
(thinking)
Hey, what about fingerprints, huh?
(MORE)
11.
CRAIG (CONT’D)
12.
I mean, those are kinda like teeth,
right? They can identify from that?
What do you do about that?
Gary talks low, becoming the hitman of Craig's dreams. He
grabs the roll on the table and dips it in sauce.
GARY
I can tell you're very thorough in
your thinking, which is good. Now,
in case the headless, uneaten body
is discovered, which has never
happened with me, but, yeah, no
more fingertips, I would have
already removed those, and
dispersed them separately.
(he takes a bite of the
roll)
Sounds kind of weird, but I've got
a ritual. So, I divide the number
of miles by the number of fingers,
so when I'm driving out to the
location, in this case 50 miles...I
roll down the window, toss one out
every 5 miles or so.
Craig is so impressed.
CRAIG
(Laughs) Just toss them fingers out
the window...shit, man, you're the
real deal, aren't ya?
IN THE VAN
Claudette glued to monitor.
IN THE BOOTH
Gary smiles.
GARY
And by the way, I'm not running a
fuckin' charity here - did you
bring the cash?
CRAIG
Oh shit, yeah, of course.
He pulls out a small envelope and passes it to Gary under the
table. I've got 25 hundred cash now, and I give you the other
25 hundred after, right?
CRAIG (CONT’D)
12.
13.
Gary smiles as he leafs through the envelope.
GARY
Great - now I just need your
absolute, final sign-off. We're
entering a contract here you won't
be able to walk away from in about
a week. So I need you to look me in
the eyes, and I need to hear the
words out of your mouth right now.
CRAIG
Chill. I just thought we'd agreed
to it already, but, yeah. Look man,
I want you to off this guy in
whatever way suits you best.
IN THE VAN
Watching the monitor.
PHIL
Got ‘em!
CLAUDETTE
I knew it.
EXT. PHO BANG - DAY13 13
Soon, they are shaking hands outside as they head into the
parking lot.
GARY
We'll be in touch.
CRAIG
Gotta say, man - hell of a
profession you're in.
GARY
Yep. The next time you see me,
you'll have a brand new life.
Craig chuckles as he heads over to his truck. Gary lingers.
CRAIG
I guess so.
POLICE CARS suddenly descend on Craig and the arresting
officers are on him quickly.
13.
14.
POLICE OFFICER 1
Freeze! Put your hands up!
POLICE OFFICER 2
Go, go, go, go.
CRAIG
What the fuck?
POLICE OFFICER 1
Let me see your hands, let me see
your hands. Turn, let me see your
hands.
CRAIG
The fuck did I do? Huh?
POLICE OFFICER 1 & 2 cuff Craig and push him against the
exterior wall of Pho Bang.
POLICE OFFICER 2
You have the right to remain
silent, anything you say can and
will be used against you in a court
of law. You have the right to an
attorney. You have the right to an
attorney. If you cannot afford an
attorney, one will be provided for
you. Do you understand these
rights? Do you understand these
rights?
Craig looks back to Gary, his Judas, in disbelief as they
arrest him.
CRAIG
I understand you should go fuck
yourself, how ‘bout that?
Gary wanders back down the alley to the van.
EXT. BACK OF RESTAURANT - DAY14 14
Gary is a little rattled as he approaches the Van. The door
is already open and there’s a celebratory mood in the air.
PHIL
Heey-ey!!!
CLAUDETTE
Okay, Daniel Day! Nailed that
fucker.
14.
15.
You got the cash, got the right words out of him, sheesh!
GARY
So, that was good?
CLAUDETTE
Yeah!
PHIL
You got him, man! Great job, Gary.
That was so smooth... who WAS that
guy in there?
GARY
I don't know.
CLAUDETTE
Open and fuckin' shut. You might
have just saved a life. How's that
feel?
GARY
Feels good. Feels really good.
PHIL
Hey, can I have my pants back now?
GARY
Yeah. (starts to adjust belt)
They look at Claudette.
CLAUDETTE
God, you guys are weird.
Claudette walks away as Phil and Gary unbuckle belts.
INT. POLICE RENTAL CAR - DAY15 15
Phil drives, Claudette is in the passenger seat, and Gary is
in a seat in the back.
PHIL
(to Gary)
Hey Gary, does your family really
have land out on the bayou?
GARY
Oh no, I made that part up. I have
been out there a few times,
birding.
15.
16.
PHIL
Birding?
CLAUDETTE
You don't say?
GARY
You know, I once saw three
pilleated woodpeckers at the same
time.
PHIL
Pill-e-ated?
GARY
Yeah. Just these big, beautiful
kinda pterodactyl-looking guys -
technically, it's the first cousin
to the illusive Ivory Bill, which
there was rumored sighting of back
in 2005 - first in over a hundred
years. Caused a big stir, because
most people think they're extinct,
but others think that they might
have just developed a successful
strategy to avoid people.
CLAUDETTE
Can we turn up the air, Phil? (she
blasts the AC)
EXT. POLICE STATION - DAY16 16
The Van pulls up and drops Gary off at his car.
CLAUDETTE
Well, great work, Gary.
PHIL
Yeah, man...
GARY
Alright, bye.
He gets in his car and is soon pulling out of the parking
lot, leaving Claudette and Phil behind.
CLAUDETTE
Oh, Jesus. Bye!
PHIL
Do you think he knows he was being
funny?
16.
17.
CLAUDETTE
I don't think so, but it's hard to
tell with Gary.
PHIL
You know, that throwing fingertips
out the window every 5 miles
shit...
CLAUDETTE
...who even thinks something like
that up??
PHIL
That's some specifically twisted
shit.
CLAUDETTE
I mean, it's safe to say we got our
new hitman, at least till Jasper
comes back.
PHIL
120 days... too soon if you ask me.
CLAUDETTE
Yeah, cause Jasper's a dick.
EXT./INT. NEW ORLEANS - DAY17 17
Gary's drive home in his Civic.
GARY (V.O.)
People feel almost disappointed to
learn that hitmen don't really
exist.
We see a montage of hitmen in film and TV, on erotic novel
covers - spanning decades. This idea that there are people
out there at a retail level you can just hire to eliminate
your worst relationship issues or facilitate some money
scheme, or the usual combination of both. It's a total pop
culture fantasy. But, because hitmen have been a staple of
books, movies, and TV for the last 50 years, good luck
getting anyone to believe their existence is all a myth. But
of course the job was not to DEBUNK the fantasy, but rather
BECOME the fantasy. And I took that part of the job very
seriously.
17.
18.
Back at Gary's home, we see him in his routine. While I
wasn't the kind of person that could ever get worked up
enough to want to kill or die for anything, maybe they had
cast me correctly, because the one thing that had prepared me
for my new job was my primary interest: the eternal mystery
of human consciousness and behavior.
INT. GARY'S HOME OFFICE - EVENING18 18
Gary is sitting at his desk. He carefully places down a FRESH
FILE.
Surveys his environment. Everything on his desk aligned.
WALT (VOICE)
So I, uh, got your number...from a
friend. Heard we should meet.
He opens the FILE to see:
WALT, the type of guy who storms the capitol.
Gary studies his face.
He combs Walt's FACEBOOK, notes his activities, hangouts,
political beliefs, sports teams, movies, books (or lack
thereof...)
WALT (VOICE) (CONT’D)
Sounds like you have a particular
set of skills and what not...
Gary at his desk, scans through Walt's arrests, parking
tickets, credit card history, mortgage payments.
WALT (VOICE) (CONT’D)
Shit, there was something else I
was supposed to say. Well, uh, I'm
sure you're picking up my drift
here of the nature of...anyway,
call me back. My name is Walt.
We push in on Facebook PHOTO OF WALT proud smile with a deer
carcass and MATCH-CUT to --
INT. DINER - MORNING19 19
Walt in the flesh. His current disposition, a little more
timid than the photo. He walks over to a man in a booth.
We don't see him yet, but Walt shifts nervously.
18.
19.
WALT
Uh, how's the pie?
GARY
All pie is good pie.
Walt's eyes bug out. It's on.
WALT
Alright. So...what's next?
FULL SCREEN MUGSHOT OF WALT.
VARIOUS NEW ORLEANS LOCATIONS20 20
We see a series of folks looking for a hitman:
- In a BAD PART OF TOWN, a BMW rolls down a window to a
DEALER on a corner...
GARY (V.O.)
I am forever fascinated and amazed
by the folks who actually think
some guy they just met 10 minutes
ago, for not that much money, would
risk the death penalty to help them
with some crazy murderous scheme.
- At an AUTO BODY SHOP, a WOMAN talks privately with a
MECHANIC...
GARY (V.O.)
I almost envy their naiveté and
passion. It doesn't matter who you
asked about finding a hitman...
At a burlesque club, a SLEAZY GUY is sitting in a booth with
a BURLESQUE DANCER...
SLEAZY GUY
You know... I've uh... been looking
for somebody to help me out with a
little... problem I've been having
lately. Figured you knew somebody
in that line of work...
BURLESQUE DANCER
I can ask around.
BACK IN THE BURLESQUE CLUB
19.
20.
The same Burlesque Dancer from the previous scene is now
backstage, on the phone with the cops.
STRIPPER
(on phone)
...I don't know how serious he is,
but dude was hella sketchy, and I
was scared.
GARY (V.O.)
...the referral usually finds its
way to the police.
We see a shot of a phone in Gary's hand, with several
messages from Unknown phone numbers.
GARY (V.O.)
...who make sure they get my
number.
AT GARY'S HOME, he watches YouTube videos on accents, hair,
make-up, fake teeth...
GARY (V.O.)
I realized not everyone fantasized
about the same fixer.
We see a Gary PREP SEQUENCE: Temp tats...beanie...stained
teeth...
GARY (V.O.)
So I found tailoring the hitman to
the individual client was much more
effective, and I had a knack for
being the person they needed me to
be.
INT. HIP-HOP CLUB - NIGHT21 21
We make our way to a back room, where a MUSIC PRODUCER is
talking with TREY.
MUSIC PRODUCER
With our album coming up soon, all
the drama and everything from that
is gonna be good for us. He's
beefin' with this cat, Rob49, this
real gangster motherfucker, so I
feel like everybody's gonna figure
'oh that's his shit'...you know,
I'm thinkin... and I'm gonna make
sure I'm out of town, so all you
gotta do is come through...
20.
21.
GARY/"TREY"
Guy, I don't need your reasons or
your fuckin' business plan. Just
give me the name and the money.
MUSIC PRODUCER
Alright! Straight to business. I
like that.
He hands over cash.
FULL SCREEN MUGSHOT OF THE MUSIC PRODUCER
PREP SEQUENCE: a wig...a snaggletooth...a poolboy uniform...
GARY (V.O.)
By the time they were sitting down
with me, they'd mostly made up
their minds. They've crossed that
psychotic Rubicon and just needed
me to confirm that their darkest
desires were the right desires.
INT. LUXURY CAR - DAY22 22
Gary as "BRANDON" sits passenger seat as a SOCIETY LADY has a
BLUEPRINT rolled out for him.
SOCIETY LADY
...If you come in the side
entrance, near the poolhouse, there
are no cameras.
GARY/"BRANDON"
Lady, this is quite the house.
SOCIETY LADY
And I'm not going to let that son
of a bitch take it from me. You do
your part...
Her hand finds his leg. She slides him a manilla envelope
STUFFED with money.
SOCIETY LADY (CONT’D)
...And I'll do mine.
GARY/"BRANDON"
Yes, Ma'am.
As he reaches for the envelope, she pulls it back.
21.
22.
SOCIETY LADY
And after he's gone, I'll be in
that big house all alone.
GARY/"BRANDON"
Big house?
SOCIETY LADY
Big house...
A FULL SCREEN MUGSHOT OF SOCIETY LADY.
GARY (V.O.)
Of course I'd charge a high society
person more just to seem more
realistic, but to me, any payment
is evidence, so I'd take whatever
they were able to give.
PREP SEQUENCE: Fake tattoo gets applied to neck...
INT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - DAY23 23
A 16-year-old, "MONTE", puts a pile of coins on top of
various 20s, 10s and ones, a little over a hundred total.
MONTE
It's not that much, but you can
have these too.
He hands over some video game cartridges, including "Call of
Duty" and "Mortal Kombat."
GARY/"BECK"
Do you really want to kill your
mom, Monte? You’re young, and
you’ll be making yourself an
orphan.
MONTE
That's the point. Did I ask your
opinion? Kill the bitch.
GARY (V.O.)
And they ended up giving this
little future school-shooter
adjudicated probation...
GARY/"BECK"
Okay, Boss.
22.
23.
FULL SCREEN MUGSHOT OF MONTE.
GARY (V.O.)
My would-be employers run the
gamut. Evenly divided between men
and women, young and old, rich and
poor.
PREP SEQUENCE: Gary puts on a tie... slicks his hair back...
puts in contacts...
EXT. MOTEL SUITE - DAY24 24
Gary is on the top floor of a grimy motel exterior. He knocks
at the door.
INT. MOTEL SUITE - DAY
Rita sits on a sofa in front of Gary as "X," meticulous and
manicured, very Patrick Bateman.
RITA
I like suicide -- that seems clean.
GARY/"X"
Doesn't it? That's the dream.
But...a left-handed person doesn't
shoot themselves with their right
hand. A person with a phobia for
heights doesn't jump. A well-tied
noose requires studying. Suicidal
people want to leave this world
quickly, they don't want to explain
themselves. Neither do I.
RITA
Maybe... surprise me?
GARY/X
Sounds lovely.
FULL SCREEN MUGSHOT OF RITA.
EXT. HOUSE - DAY25 25
Outside a trailer, Gary is in character as "NICO," a steely
Russian professional (Stringy black hair, gold tooth,
turtleneck). He walks around the side of the house, following
TAMMY, who smokes a menthol cig.
23.

TAMMY
See, I filed a mental health
warning against him a while back,
describing him as suicidal, so
it'll make sense to everyone. Then
I can sue his doctors for
malpractice.
GARY/"NICO"
You are smart lady.
TAMMY
I'm thinking cut the wrists and
then hold him till he bleeds to
death?
GARY/"NICO"
I 'em in service beezness.
TAMMY
I heard that's a fairly painless
way to go, bleeding to death... Now
I don't have the kind of money you
were talking about on the phone in
cash, but I have a deal that'll be
worth even more to you.
They've arrived at a large tarp covering a big object of some
kind.
Tammy pulls back the tarp, revealing a boat.
TAMMY (CONT’D)
See, you can have this boat, but
you can't sell it in Louisiana,
because there's an insurance claim
against it. But you take it over to
East Texas, Beaumont or Port
Arthur, I guarantee you'll get at
least 6 thousand for it.
GARY/"NICO"
Speed boat. Like Miami Vice.
TAMMY
Yeah! Like Miami Vice!

INT. NEW ORLEANS UNIVERSITY - LECTURE HALL - DAY26 26
We follow a woman, who we'll come to know as ALICIA, into a
classroom and find Gary mid-lecture (full chalkboard) to his
young college students:
GARY
...Believe me, we will get to all
of this eventually, but let me jump
in and pose a question, cause I
think it's going to be a lot of
what we're going to be exploring
this semester - these concepts of
personality, self, and
consciousness. My simple question
is: How many of you think you know
yourselves?
The class has no movement.
GARY (CONT’D)
Think you have a strong sense of
who you are?
The class is slow to respond, with half the hands going up.
GARY (CONT’D)
Oh come on, you don't know
yourselves?
He gestures for them to raise their hands. Slowly, silently,
the rest of the hands go up.
GARY (CONT’D)
Of course you do. Your entire being
is invested with this notion of
self, it has to be for its own
survival. But what we'll be doing
this semester is challenging this
notion. What if your SELF is a
construction, an illusion, an act,
a role you've been playing every
day since you can remember?
Gary pauses when he spots a WOMAN (Alicia) in the back.
GARY (V.O.)
It's always a poignant moment when
your ex is having a kid with
someone else.
GARY
We'll see.
25.
26.
EXT. CAMPUS QUAD - DAY27 27
Gary now sits across from ALICIA. Clinical psychologist.
She's got that over-educated bite to her.
ALICIA
Seems like a pretty good class.
GARY (V.O.)
I know many people despise their
exes, but Alicia might have been my
best friend.
GARY
I'm glad you approve.
GARY (V.O.)
Or at least the person who knew me
best.
ALICIA
So, if the self is a construct, and
it's all just role play, do you
think people can change?
GARY
Yeah, within our set-points, which
isn't really that much.
ALICIA
Yeah, I was never really sure about
that. You know, there's actually
been a lot of recent research and
data that says we can.
GARY
Enlighten me.
ALICIA
I mean, I've been reading a lot
recently about how researchers are
finding that people can change
their personalities well into
adulthood. I'm working with
numerous clients on it.
GARY
Define change.
26.
27.
ALICIA
K. The five traits that make up
personality - extroversion,
openness to experience, emotional
stability, agreeableness and
conscientiousness...they can all be
altered within just a few months.
GARY
In what sense, though?
ALICIA
Well, you have to embody the trait
rather than just think about it.
You know, the "as if" principle,
where you behave "as if" you are
the person you want to be, and then
pretty soon you might realize...
that is you.
GARY
And the old you goes... where,
exactly?
ALICIA
Still there, just dialed down
significantly, and the new you is
dialed up.
GARY
So, you just didn't have a couple
decades to wait for me to change?
ALICIA
Well, uh, if there was one thing
you seemed least interested in, it
was probably change.
GARY
I've accepted the idea - a normal
relationship isn't in my cards.
ALICIA
But what is normal? Look at it this
way: everyone is at least a little
fucked up. You just need to find
someone who is a little fucked up
in a way you like. Or at least, I
don't know, in a way that
compliments your own fucked-upped-
ness. That's a different kind of
survival technique, that would
involve another person.
27.
28.
GARY
Okay...
Alicia moves on.
ALICIA
Okay... Speaking of fucked up, I
thought... I don't know, I thought
you were just doing tech support
stuff for the police, and now
you're like a full-blown undercover
murder-stopper?
GARY
Yeah - that's me.
ALICIA
I'm sorry, that must be so weird.
GARY
I'm never gonna give up teaching,
but this undercover thing is like
field research.
ALICIA
How so?
GARY
Oh man, you would not believe the
side of humanity I'm hanging out
with. And a lot of it is seeing how
love has just curdled into hate,
and murder is just the best way
out.
Alicia is amused at the thought.
ALICIA
Wow. I have a feeling you never
wanted to murder me when we were
married.
GARY
You're saying it like it's a bad
thing?
ALICIA
No, no... It's just an observation.
I mean, to kill someone, I'd just
imagine you'd have to be capable of
some serious passion.
GARY
I'm not incapable of passion.
28.
29.
ALICIA
For certain things, yes,
definitely, but... I think you
should see someone.
GARY
Like a therapist?
ALICIA
No, no. Like a woman. Or whatever.
GARY
I have the loyal company of Id and
Ego.
ALICIA
(Laughs) Okay... You need to see a
woman and a therapist.
INT. POLICE HEADQUARTERS - DAY28 28
We come in mid-meeting amongst the undercover division and
their immediate supervisor, SERGEANT HANK.
JASPER
...I'm tellin' ya, I just don't
think it's the best use of my
skills.
SERGEANT HANK
Just remember, Jasper, if it
weren't for the police union, you
wouldn't even have a job right now.
JASPER
Understood, but now that I am back,
I should have my job back.
Indicates Gary.
JASPER (CONT’D)
At least I'm trained for it.
SERGEANT HANK
Maybe you hadn't heard since you
were on suspension, but Gary's done
a great job. His conviction rate is
higher, and frankly, he's got a
better range than you do.
Jasper scoffs and goes after Gary, who wants no part of this
argument.
29.
30.
JASPER
You believe that, Gary?
GARY
I...
JASPER
You guys think that's true?
They don’t know what to say. When confronted, Phil
reluctantly gives the truth.
PHIL
Stats don't lie...
SERGEANT HANK
You don't like your position,
Jasper?
Maybe I can find something for you over in traffic patrol.
JASPER
Well, shit. Why don't you just have
me clean the toilets around here,
Sarge? I can do that!
SERGEANT HANK
Since you're being the asshole,
I'll just come right out and say
it: we're trying to hide your face,
okay?
Hank pulls up his phone, mimes loading a video.
SERGEANT HANK (CONT’D)
(imitates a parent)
"Who's that beating up those
teenagers?!"
JASPER
Not for no reason...
SERGEANT HANK
Maybe you've forgotten, Jasper,
unlike the 9 million other people
who watched your video, but we got
an angry public out there, and we
don't want them in our business. So
take my advice, do yourself and all
of us a favor - lay low and keep
your goddamn mouth shut. Can you do
that?
Jasper steams, saying nothing.
30.
31.
SERGEANT HANK (CONT’D)
Anything else?
INT. GARY'S HOUSE - LATER29 29
We are back in Gary's domestic routine.
-He delicately opens a file -- with energy bill and deeds.
Gary continues to dig.
GARY (V.O.)
Mother was Miss Del Rio. They all
moved to New Orleans after Katrina.
Parents divorced... no father in
the picture. Short stints
hairdressing, flight attendant.
Married to husband, Ray Masters.
Works in his family's oil and gas
business.
Digs deeper.
GARY (V.O.)
Then nothing.
Gary looks through Police Log files of domestic disturbance
reports...
GARY (V.O.)
No criminal record... A couple of
domestic complaints... no arrests.
Gary looks at her picture as if trying to know her.
GARY
So, Madison, who is your hitman?
EXT. PLEASE U CAFE - MORNING30 30
We see the surveillance van parked across the street and then
follow a moving streetcar in time to catch Madison walking
into the Cafe.
INT. PLEASE U CAFE - MORNING31 31
Similar to the Walt meeting, Madison walks over to Gary's
booth. When she sees the half-eaten piece of pie in front of
him, she stops -- takes a deep breath.
31.
32.
We see Gary for the first time as RON, scruffy, dirty, sexy.
The guy you worry your wife will go back to after you have a
fight. Ron is a seducer, a charmer, with a big smile.
MADISON
Are you enjoying your pie?
GARY/"RON"
All pie is good pie.
"Ron" stands, offers his hand.
GARY/"RON" (CONT’D)
Ron.
MADISON
Madison.
They sit across from each other, not sure where to start.
GARY/"RON"
So, tell me, Madison, what do you
do for a living?
MADISON
Devoted wife.
GARY/"RON"
Obviously. I assume that's what we
are here to talk about.
MADISON
Mm hmm...and to answer your
question, he doesn't let me work.
He doesn't really let me do
anything. Can I have a bite of that
pie?
GARY/"RON"
Sure.
He slides it over and she takes a forkful.
MADISON
He has me on this stupid diet.
She takes a bite and smiles.
MADISON (CONT’D)
Oh, this is good.
Madison looks off, eyes catch a small dog at another table.
32.
33.
MADISON (CONT’D)
Oh, look, he's so cute.
(to Gary)
You a dog person?
GARY/"RON"
Do I look like a cat person?
MADISON
Yeah. I don't really get cats.
Kinda creepy...you know?
GARY/"RON"
Really?
MADISON
Yeah, all those stories...
GARY/"RON"
What stories?
MADISON
The ones about jealous cats
smothering babies, that kind of
stuff.
GARY/"RON"
Whoa.
MADISON
Uh huh.
GARY/"RON"
Do you know someone who's lost a
child to a murderous, jealous cat?
I'm just trying to do my fact-
checking here.
MADISON
Not, like, personally, but I've
heard it from like, a lot of
people.
GARY/"RON"
Then there you go. We need to get
to the bottom of this.
MADISON
I agree.
GARY/"RON"
Detective, did we pull any paw
prints off the victim?
33.
34.
MADISON
No sir, but we're herding suspects
now.
GARY/"RON"
Ugh, no small challenge as we know.
MADISON
Ugh... an utter Cat-astrophe.
A fun moment of connection.
GARY/"RON"
You're good.
MADISON
You too.
(a beat)
And what do you do...?
Off his look.
MADISON (CONT’D)
Oh. I'm sorry, I forgot.
Madison takes a few deep breaths.
GARY/"RON"
It's okay. This is a lot.
MADISON
Yeah. I can't believe I'm doing
this.
GARY/"RON"
You're in good hands with me.
A long beat.
MADISON
So...how does this usually work?
GARY/"RON"
How do you want it to work?
MADISON
I don't know. I'm just really
scared.
GARY/"RON"
Why are you scared?
34.
35.
MADISON
(truly frightened)
He's a bad person. You don't know
what I married into... and just
keeps getting worse and worse.
Madison feels she's said too much, and turns the focus onto
"Ron."
GARY/"RON"
I hear you.
MADISON
Did you always know you wanted to
be a...?
GARY/"RON"
Not exactly a childhood dream.
MADISON
Do you ever think about... like, if
you did something else? Or if you
chose a different path?
GARY/"RON"
I don't overthink things, I'm not
very sentimental.
MADISON
Well, we all have regrets...
GARY/"RON"
Well, in my line of work, I can't
afford to think that way.
MADISON
Wish I could do that. I just feel
like I'm in prison, and I am going
to die in prison.
Gary locks eyes with Madison. Deeper recognition.
MADISON (CONT’D)
But I'm not going to die in prison,
because what if me coming here and
meeting with you is the best
decision I've ever made because
it's for me.
A glimmer of hope in her eyes. It’s sweet. Her phone buzzes,
she checks it anxiously.
35.
36.
MADISON (CONT’D)
Sorry. Shit, it's him. I have to
go. I brought the...
Madison places an ENVELOPE on the table. Gary looks at it,
knows what happens if she slides it over to him.
GARY/"RON"
Can I throw something out there?
GARY/"RON" (CONT’D)
Listen, there's nothing in this for
me - technically, I'm un-employing
myself here, but do your future
self, the one that deserves a
happy, fulfilling life, that can
still have that, a big favor. Take
what's in there and get a new life.
Right now. Don't go home.
She looks at him, almost confused.
GARY/"RON" (CONT’D)
And, if you need anything or if you
change your mind... you have my
number.
INT. STREETCAR - LATER32 32
Gary rides home on a Streetcar. His phone rings.
GARY
Hello?
INT. POLICE STATION - SAME TIME33 33
In the briefing room, Claude and Phil hover over a CONFERENCE
TABLE SPEAKER PHONE as Jasper paces in the background.
CLAUDETTE
So, you're a fuckin' life coach
now?!
PHIL
Is what I just saw and listened to
what I saw and listened to? I'm not
believing it.
GARY
What?
36.
37.
CLAUDETTE
What?
Never mind the sting operation...
PHIL
...let me be your therapist?!
GARY
She's not a killer - she just needs
to get it together. I'm trying to
serve the overall public good.
Jasper can't take it any longer and comes over to the
speaker.
JASPER
Public good?! What you did was one
of the most unprofessional things
I’ve ever witnessed.
(to Claudette and Phil)
See? This is what happens when you
send an untrained boy to do a man’s
job.
GARY
C'mon - I steered clear of
entrapment...
JASPER
You let the jury decide that - at
least you got 'em in custody.
CLAUDETTE
Okay. We can agree to disagree on
technique. It's over.
Phil tries to lighten the mood.
PHIL
(to Claudette)
And did you notice how cute she
was? I wonder if that had ANYTHING
to do with it?
JASPER
Well, we'll never know since this
weirdo let her off before she could
start incriminating herself.
(beat)
It was, let's say, an unusual
outcome, and it'll be written up as
such.
37.
38.
GARY
Okay, fine...
PHIL
Okay, talk soon, Gary.
GARY
Bye.
CLAUDETTE
Bye, Gary.
GARY
Bye.
Jasper walks out of the room. Claudette goes to hang up, but
turns down the volume instead.
CLAUDETTE
Geez Louise, he's sweatin' Gary
hard.
PHIL
We've seen this before: starter
goes down, back-up comes in and
kicks ass forever more. Jasper is
Bledsoe, Gary is Brady.
Back to Gary on Streetcar, still listening.
POLICE STATION CLAUDETTE
I know he dropped the ball on this
one, but, what's the name he used?
PHIL
Ron.
CLAUDETTE
Yo, Ron is fuckin' dope. He's like
a caucasian Idris.
PHIL (ON RADIO)
I would love to grab a beer with
that guy - and I'm not talking
about GARY.
CLAUDETTE
I would get black-out drunk with
Ron.
PHIL
I'd let him talk me into ripping
lines on the way to Vegas.
38.
(MORE)
39.
CLAUDETTE
I'd rip my I.U.D. out for Ron.
I
wouldn't share a straw with Gary.
PHIL
Gary is hung like a straw, but Ron,
strictly nightstick.
CLAUDETTE
I mean, it's kind of sounding like
you would fuck Ron, too.
PHIL
I would take your sloppy seconds,
if it were Ron.
Back to Gary, who has overheard the entire exchange.
INT. COURTROOM - DAY34 34
We are in a Courtroom where the guy, CRAIG (from the opening)
is being tried. As he scowls at Gary from across the room, in
a closing argument statement, an over-the-top theatrical
DEFENSE ATTORNEY is pouring nothing but vitriol on Gary.
DEFENSE LAWYER
...This whole prosecution has been
nothing more than an entrapping,
sting operation! And this guy...
(points at Gary)
...is the most dishonest,
manipulative, fraudulent kind of
person there is! This Gary Johnson
isn't a human being. For a human
being has humanity. Empathy! A
human being AIDS in moments of
weakness. Gary Johnson PREYS on the
weak. As far as legal procedures
go, it's like this undercover ghoul
is using an AR-15 to kill a
mosquito!
Gary sits, expressionless.
GARY (V.O.)
I'm so used to this. While I've put
forth a ton of irrefutable
evidence, all they've got is to
somehow make me the villain.
(MORE)
39.
GARY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
40.
I know they're just doing their
jobs, but a personal attack is
still a personal attack and kind of
sucks to have to listen to.
MOMENTS LATER FOREMAN
We the jury find the defendant
guilty as charged.
Craig scowls at Gary.
GARY (V.O.)
...but in the "people are forever
mysteries" category, this would
often happen:
INT. COURTROOM - DAY35 35
A new day. A new trial. We see a guy testifying:
HUSBAND
I mean, I've forgiven her, she's
forgiven me, and hell, I've done
much worse. I think she deserves a
second chance...
We realize it's Tammy on trial, and that's her husband - the
intended victim - testifying on her behalf.
GARY (V.O.)
Which was usually followed by this:
QUICK CUT to Jury Foreman:
JURY FOREMAN
In light of all the evidence and
testimony we've heard, we find the
defendant not guilty.
There's a "whoop" of celebration in the courtroom and Gary
looks over to the prosecutor sitting next to him. All they
can do is shrug their shoulders, "oh well."
Tammy and her husband are now hugging, followed by occasional
ugly stares back at Gary.
GARY (V.O.)
Maybe their love wasn't perfect,
but it was something.
GARY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
40.
41.
EXT. SWAMP - DAY36 36
In the middle of nowhere Louisiana, we hear gunshots.
MARCUS
I hear ya - I swear our country's
legal system...PULL!
BAM! A redneck named MARCUS lowers a shotgun. A miss.
MARCUS (CONT’D)
Is fuckin' fucked.
Marcus turns to "Tanner" (Gary as a tatted-up-unstable-ex-
Veteran, tobacco stains, lots of camo), who's ready to launch
another, but is more ready to talk some shit with his new
buddy. Marcus hands Gary/Tanner his gun, which Gary turns
down.
GARY/"TANNER"
Ah, no. You need the practice a lot
more than I do! You can't blame
someone for taking the law into
their own hands. There's a thing I
really believe in, and that's
personal justice, for when our
pussified justice system fails.
When we do this, and, when we do
this right, personal justice,
that's gonna be yours. You didn't
take all that unfairness laying
down.
MARCUS
Hell, no I didn't.
PULL!
Tanner releases and a clay pigeon explodes.
MARCUS (CONT’D)
That's the America I miss right
there.
GARY/"TANNER"
Amen amen.
(flashes his fingers 9)
There are three things you need to
kill a man. The gun. The bullets.
And the balls. And, boy, I been
stockpiling all three of those
things.
Gary/Tanner ball-taps Marcus.
41.
42.
MARCUS
Son of a bitch, Tanner. PULL!
He powders another.
MARCUS (CONT’D)
That's what I'm talkin' about right
there.
FULL SCREEN MUGSHOT OF MARCUS.
INT. GARY'S HOUSE - DAY37 37
Gary is reading next to Id and Ego.
His phone DINGS, not Gary's phone, his "WORK" PHONE...
A TEXT from Madison:
"Hey, Ron! No pressure at all, just thought it may be your
speed. Hope you're well!"
Gary scrolls down to see FLYER: a pathetically cute puppy
with a leg cast and an eye patch that says: "Cause for Paws."
GARY (V.O.)
I would, of course, never cross
this line. I'm a professional.
INT. GARY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT38 38
Later that night, Gary lies in bed looking at the text again.
GARY (V.O.)
But technically she didn't text ME,
she texted RON. But, I don't think
I'm a dog person. In fact, I may be
allergic to them. Physically and
emotionally. I find them to be too
needy, just pandering to whoever
holds the meat.
Gary's thumbs hover over the phone.
GARY (V.O.)
But...at the end of the day, we're
all spineless...we beg for more,
embarrass ourselves for the scraps
of others...
42.
43.
EXT. CITY PARK - DAY39 39
A TONGUE licks Gary's face...as "Ron."
GARY (V.O.)
...Dogs just don't apologize for
it.
It's a gooey-eyed PUPPY.
"Ron" stands among a small section of the park turned into a
'dog carnival.' Refreshment stations, a volunteer sign-up,
lots of rescue dogs behind temporary fencing, looking for
their forever homes. Madison approaches him.
MADISON
You made it!
Wow, I thought I loved puppies.
GARY/"RON"
Well, I gargle barbecue sauce like
Listerine before these things.
Keeps the bitches bitchin'.
He gently puts the dog back.
A little later, they are walking slightly away from the
group.
MADISON
I'm glad you came.
GARY/"RON"
I'm glad you invited me.
They subtly wander away from the crowd.
MADISON
So, how are you?
GARY/"RON"
I'm fine, I'm fine. The real
question is, how are YOU?
MADISON
I'm great. I got out of there
almost immediately. I have my own
place now in St. Roch - it's a mess
but it's mine, so I love it. I'm
getting a divorce... Sometimes you
just gotta make a move.
43.
44.
GARY/"RON"
I'm so happy for you. You know,
when I saw your text, I thought, is
she picking a dog charity as the
place to re-engage me?
They both laugh a little.
MADISON
No! Oh God no, that crazy moment
has long passed. New me, new life,
he's like...
She makes a gesture of "it's over" by wiping hands.
GARY/"RON"
And look at you now.
Indicates her new curly hair.
MADISON
Do you like the hair?
GARY/"RON"
Love the hair.
MADISON
He hated it. He hated dogs, hated,
so, you know what? I'm just making
up for lost time.
GARY/"RON"
Well, I'm just so happy this is how
it's all going for you.
MADISON
Thank you. No, but really, thank
you. I don't want to be weird, but
I couldn't have done it without
you. There! I said it.
GARY/"RON"
I don't get a lot of thank you's in
my line of work.
MADISON
Yeah, I guess not.
One of Madison's co-workers, JILL, approaches.
JILL
Madison, we have a situation in the
husky cage. Code brown.
44.
45.
GARY/"RON"
Hi.
JILL
Hi.
MADISON
Ron, Jill. Jill, Ron.
GARY/"RON"
Nice to meet you. Need any help?
MADISON
No, no, we're good. You okay?
GARY/"RON"
I'm great! I've got things to do!
Madison is all smiles.
Gary/"Ron" takes off running across the field where four 8-10
year-olds throw a football. He intercepts a pass.
GARY/"RON" (CONT’D)
Okay, who's going long?
A COUPLE KIDS take off. Ron gestures for them to go deep as
he then hurls a long bomb which one kid manages to catch.
GARY/"RON" (CONT’D)
There it is!
INT. VAUGHN'S LOUNGE - NIGHT40 40
A little later, they sit across from one another, a few
drinks in. Madison is finishing up a funny story and they are
both laughing. She gathers herself, looks at Gary, as if
studying him...
MADISON
No, no, no. I don't buy it.
GARY/"RON"
What?
MADISON
You're not a hitman. You can't be.
You cuddled puppies, you played
with kids, you've opened every door
for me tonight. And yet...you kill
people for money?
45.
46.
GARY/"RON"
Chivalry may be dead, but I didn't
kill it.
MADISON
And I tried looking you up, and
nothing. It's like you don't exist.
GARY/"RON"
I guess I'm just your fantasy.
MADISON
Okay. We'll see about that. How
many? Wait, I don't want to know.
(off his look)
What? Does a gentleman not kill and
tell?
GARY/"RON"
Okay. For the record, I love
people.
MADISON
And yet you kill them.
GARY/"RON"
Not just randomly. It's always with
a purpose. To protect. And make no
mistake, there are some people who
need killing, right?
MADISON
Right. (Beat) So what's the
difference between the real you
and...your occupation.
GARY/"RON"
Hmmm... I guess the real me is a
people person, I like to have a
good time. But to be most effective
in this job, I have to be a bit of
a lone wolf. I have to never draw
any attention to myself, I don't
want anyone to remember my face. I
don’t want to over or under tip, I
don’t want to be pulled into
memorable conversations. That’s why
I drive a Honda Civic... I want it
to seem like I don’t exist. That’s
the professional side of me.
46.
47.
MADISON
Tell me a little more about the
unprofessional side.
(she takes a sip)
GARY/"RON"
I'd say being here with you right
now is pretty damn unprofessional,
but hey...
MADISON
Good. I don't want you too
professional.
GARY/"RON"
How do you want me?
Madison gives him "that" look.
MADISON
What? Do I scare you?
GARY/"RON"
No. Do I scare you?
MADISON
Should I be scared?
GARY/"RON"
That depends on what your
intentions are.
A loaded beat.
GARY/"RON" (CONT’D)
Okay. You want to know all about
me, but what about you?
MADISON
You know all you need to know.
GARY/"RON"
Is that right?
You could cut the sexual tension in here with a knife or
another lethal weapon.
INT. MADISON'S HOUSE - LATER41 41
THEY ENTER, slamming against the shut door, devouring each
other. He picks her up and she wraps her legs around him.
47.
48.
GARY (V.O.)
I was once told I think too much to
be a good lover. She said
exceptional sex requires a lack of
thought - a certain amount of
animal abandon...
He carries her to the kitchen island, she pulls his shirt
off...
GARY (V.O.)
I liked Ron - he wasn't a thinker,
he was a doer.
...in the kitchen, Ron seductively pushes her back as he goes
down...
INT. MADISON'S BEDROOM - LATER42 42
Madison and "Ron" are in the throes of sex.
GARY (V.O.)
...So, I don't know if I was just
better as Ron, or if it was that
electric charge going through both
of us...After all, in her mind, she
was having sex with someone who had
murdered a bunch of people, and I
was having sex with someone who was
clearly capable of having a lover
killed.
We see Gary, shirtless in the bathroom, drinking water from
the sink, as Madison appears behind him in the mirror in
lingerie.
GARY (V.O.)
I'm not proud to say this, but it
upped my game.
INT. BEDROOM - LATER43 43
Hardly dressed, under the sheets, they are having an intimate
conversation between kissing, etc.
MADISON
You know, I haven't been with
anyone else in so long... Can I
tell you something?
GARY/"RON"
What?
48.
(MORE)
49.
MADISON
This is fun.
GARY/"RON"
I agree.
MADISON
I like this, us.
Ron smiles.
GARY/"RON"
Yeah.
Look, on a full-disclosure, cautionary note: I've had a few
girlfriends, and that early marriage, but, because of my line
of work, I generally have trouble maintaining what most would
consider a normal relationship.
MADISON
Fuck normal.
GARY/"RON"
Amen.
MADISON
Do you wanna see me again?
GARY/"RON"
Yeah, but it's a little
complicated, isn't it?
MADISON
It doesn't have to be.
GARY/"RON"
Is this is a bad idea?
MADISON
I suppose it is.
A charged moment, then --
GARY/"RON"
For instance, we can never go to my
place --
MADISON
Good. I don't want to.
GARY/"RON"
I can never give you any info about
my whereabouts, at any time.
(MORE)
49.
GARY/"RON" (CONT’D)
50.
If I'm tracked or traced, you'd be
pulled right into the middle of it.
MADISON
I will see you when I see you.
GARY/"RON"
And we can only get so personal.
The less you know about me, the
less I know about you --
MADISON
Okay, what's your next line, "don't
fall in love with me?" I know what
this is. I don't want to know where
you live, or what you're doing at
any given moment. We're just going
to meet here whenever we want and
nothing outside of here matters.
GARY/"RON"
Well, okay then.
MADISON
Well, okay.
A seductive grin.
GARY
So, we agree to the terms?
MADISON
Where do I sign?
He points to his lips. She kisses them.
MADISON (CONT’D)
Anywhere else I need to sign?
Points to his chest.
GARY/"RON"
Initial here.
She kisses. She moves lower.
MADISON
Anywhere else I need to initial?
She moves lower, soon under the covers...
MADISON (CONT’D)
We gotta make sure...this
document...is air tight.
GARY/"RON" (CONT’D)
50.
51.
EXT. NEW ORLEANS STREET44 44
We see the cross street for Piety and Pleasure.
INT. LECTURE HALL - DAY45 45
Gary paces in front of his class.
GARY
The Freudian concepts of the Id and
the Superego, are, in Jung's view,
in constant struggle with each
other. The "Superego" is our
conscience.
EXT. MADISON'S BUNGALOW BALCONY - NIGHT46 46
Madison pours wine on her naked body as Gary licks it off of
her neck.
GARY
It rewards us for behaving
properly, adhering to societal
norms and moralistic standards.
INT. LECTURE HALL - DAY47 47
STUDENTS scribble away.
GARY
So, the "Id"...
INT. MADISON'S BUNGALOW - NIGHT48 48
GARY (O.S.)
...As humans we have desires and
instincts that are primitive...
Legs, arms, and skin.
GARY (O.S.) (CONT’D)
...Urges that are solely based in
the pursuit of pleasure, ignoring
the consequences...
INT. MADISON'S BUNGALOW - MORNING49 49
Gary leaves her place dressed as "Ron."
51.
52.
GARY (O.S.)
...now the "Ego" is the middle-man.
The bridge between instinct and
logic...
INT. POLICE STATION - LATER50 50
Gary walks into the station dressed as "Gary."
GARY (O.S.)
...the law and the lawless. Forever
attempting to maximize pleasure
while minimizing the cost...
EXT. COLLEGE CAMPUS - AFTERNOON51 51
Gary walks through the campus, a little more bounce in his
step.
INT. MADISON'S BUNGALOW - LATE NIGHT52 52
When Madison opens the door, we see she is dressed in a SEXY
FLIGHT ATTENDANT UNIFORM.
She uses her fingers to guide Ron in like a plane, and speaks
in a flight attendant voice.
MADISON
Welcome to Madison Airlines.
GARY/"RON"
Where we flying?
MADISON
Somewhere hot... and tropical.
Please follow me to the upper deck.
GARY/"RON"
First class all the way.
MADISON
Shh. Sir, please unbuckle your
belt. It's for your own safety.
She starts up the stairs seductively.
MADISON (CONT’D)
We're anticipating heavy
turbulence...
(look)
So prepare to brace for impact.
52.
53.
LATER, Madison puts a pilot's hat on Gary as they make out on
the bed.
A LITTLE LATER
Madison and Gary are in her old, "ironclaw" BATHTUB together,
candles, bubbles, and all. Gary is in front of Madison. They
both laugh, Madison at the end of a funny story.
She eventually segues...
MADISON
I know we agreed to not talk about
stuff like this, and you don't have
to answer if you don't want to, but
how do you do it and not get
caught?
GARY/"RON"
Well, you gotta be smart, thorough,
a few steps ahead of what you know
they're going to be looking for.
Gary pauses. Their contract above the shredder...
GARY/"RON" (CONT’D)
You know the dirty secret is, most
murders go unsolved - especially
around here. So, my M.O. is to
engage in a more controlled
environment, then move the body
somewhere that says - "chaos."
MADISON
Isn't that messy?
GARY/"RON"
Can be, if you're not smart about
it. Quick, you're going to shoot
me. Where?
He holds up his hands like she's got a gun on him -- she
points her finger at his head.
GARY/"RON" (CONT’D)
No! Lower.
(points at his neck)
Lower.
(points to crotch)
Okay! (laughs)
He gently takes her hand and aims
it at his chest.
53.
54.
GARY/"RON" (CONT’D)
The heart. I mean, certain areas
like the head or the neck, the
blood has nowhere to go, but out.
Talk about a bloody mess. I mean,
and people, we're just big skin-
bags of blood, and you have this
big, beautiful thoracic cavity to
hold it all in, until you move the
body... set the scene, tell the
story you want them to find.
PREP SEQUENCE: Velvet pants...black rubber gloves...
EXT. NEW ORLEANS POWER PLANT - MORNING53B 53B
GARY (V.O.)
You know, I was always too shy to
go out for the high school play,
but I had somehow found my stage,
and each arrest was like a standing
ovation.
Joe stares at an unsettling ginger, "DEAN."
GARY/"DEAN"
We're about to go into the deep end
of the pool here. This is serious.
If I take this envelope and
leave... This time tomorrow, her
head is in a Winn-Dixie bag, the
rest of her is pig slop in
Opelousas. Now, be absolutely clear
with me.
Is that what you want?
Joe considers.
JOE
I got this woman, she's into this
iPhone swiping... she boyfriend
findin', right? And she's slingin'
her kitty across the Causeway with
this manager from the Piccadilly,
AND then wanna take everything too?
Now, I don't know how things work
where you from... but from around
here, you don't take a man TV, his
dog, AND his boat. No way, T. -
Kill da slut.
54.
55.
GARY/DEAN
With pleasure.
JOE
(giggles excitedly)
A FULL SCREEN MUGSHOT OF JOE.
INT. COURT - DAY54 54
Gary sits in the witness box as a Defense Lawyer works the
floor in front of him.
DEFENSE LAWYER #2
...Your Honor, a psychopathic
predator will always be a threat to
society. On the other hand, someone
who once commits a crime of
passion, or sudden passion as it is
known legally, is no more likely to
commit that crime again than any
other member of society. In this
case, I would characterize just the
intent to entertain the
solicitation of murder, although no
one was ultimately harmed, as a
kind of "sudden passion" as opposed
to attempted premeditated murder.
PROSECUTION
Objection!
JUDGE
Overruled. A question would be
welcome.
The defense lawyer closes in on Gary.
DEFENSE LAWYER #2
Mr. Johnson, you testified
previously that you felt this was a
premeditated act. By that, did you
mean YOU conjuring this whole thing
and coercing them into a murder
scheme was premeditated?
GARY
There was nothing sudden or
impulsive about our meeting. The
intent was clear. The follow-
through was detailed.
55.
56.
DEFENSE LAWYER #2
If you were not attempting
coercion...why the research? Why
the costumes? Why the disguises?
Sure, my client has found himself
in compromising circumstances...but
my question to you, Mr. Johnson:
What are your circumstances?
PROSECUTION
Objection, your honor!
JUDGE
Sustained.
DEFENSE LAWYER #2
What are you hiding with these
costumes? Who are you trying to
fool?
GARY (V.O.)
What would Ron do?
PROSECUTION
Objection, the defense is badgering
the witness --
The Judge waves him off.
GARY
My job is not to analyze the events
around my meeting. My job is to
meet the client at those
circumstances. Complete the picture
they've already drawn for
themselves...
Gary locks on the Defense. A side they haven't seen.
GARY (CONT’D)
...and I am not in the business of
second chances.
INT. MADISON'S LIVING ROOM - DAY55 55
Madison slowly approaches Gary with her hands behind her
back, grinning.
MADISON
I got something we can play with.
56.
57.
GARY/"RON"
I like the sound of that. What do
you got back there?
MADISON
Pick a hand.
GARY/"RON"
Left.
She throws up a PISTOL in her right hand.
MADISON
You lose.
GARY/"RON"
Whoa! Shit. What is that for?
His cautionary tone catches her off guard.
MADISON
What do you think? I'm a woman
living by myself, I gotta protect
myself.
Plus, all that talk of murder freaked me out.
GARY/"RON"
Trust me, that is NOT gonna be
making you any safer.
MADISON
You have a gun.
GARY/"RON"
It's a little different - I'm a
professional.
MADISON
Are you going to show me how to use
it or what?
GARY/"RON"
Now?
Didn't we have a contract or something about nothing outside
of here matters?
MADISON
We have to leave our love nest at
some point, don't we?
GARY/"RON"
Do we?
57.
58.
BANG! BANG!
INT. GUN RANGE - LATER56 56
BANG! BANG!
Madison holds the PISTOL steady, all focus downrange.
Gary/"Ron" looks down the gallery - flips a switch, sending
the SILHOUETTED TARGET back toward them.
No bullet holes. All misses.
MADISON
Okay. I suck.
GARY/"RON"
Self-healing targets.
MADISON
Why is this so hard?
GARY/"RON"
It just takes practice.
MADISON
Why don't you show me, hot shot.
We see a flash of "Gary," before he pivots back to "Ron."
He takes the GLOCK from her, toggles a SWITCH, sending the
target even closer toward them on a rail...
GARY/"RON"
Well, this distance is for
weekenders, tourists.
The target comes closer, closer, closer...
It stops. TWO FEET AWAY FROM THEM.
Gary, while looking Madison in the eyes, quickly FIRES almost
point blank at the target's heart.
GARY/"RON" (CONT’D)
That's my usual distance.
INT. VIRGO'S ALLEY - NIGHT57 57
Madison passes a JOINT to Ron as they laugh.
58.
59.
MADISON
Okay, hear me out: if the moon
controls the tides, and if we're
mostly water, then how could a full
moon not affect you? Think about
it.
GARY/"RON"
Well technically, that makes no
sense.
MADISON
No, it makes sense.
GARY/"RON"
A phase of the moon has nothing to
do with gravity - it has to do with
shadows. A phase is just how much
of the sun's light we are blocking
on the way to the moon. The
gravitational relationship between
the moon and Earth, these two
planetary bodies, is fixed...so the
moon may look different throughout
the month, but nothing is actually
changing on Earth, ya know?
MADISON
Okay - I didn't know I was out with
Neil fuckin' deGrasse Tyson.
GARY/"RON"
Gotta keep you guessin'.
MADISON
Let's go dance, white boy.
GARY/"RON"
Yeah.
INT. VIRGO NIGHTCLUB - LATER58 58
Madison leads "Ron" to the dance floor through smoke, laser
lights, and grinding bodies. The music is loud -- too loud to
talk, too loud to think.
Gary tries to find the beat. He isn't a dancer, so neither is
Ron.
But Ron has something Gary doesn't - thoughtless confidence
and some joy in just being there. She laughs and smiles.
He looks at Madison -- she's sweaty and completely alive...
59.
60.
EXT. ALLEY ENTRANCE TO BAR - NIGHT59 59
LATER, Madison and Gary stumble out the exit, laughing.
Madison is draped over him, kissing his neck.
RAY'S BUDDY
Ray...
RAY
Madison?
MADISON
Fuck...
She pulls herself off of Gary. Ray stares at her as Madison
shrinks. A version of her we've never seen.
RAY, looks loaded on Jaeger and cocaine. Right now he is
overwhelmed, even like he might cry.
RAY
Fuck. I've been calling you.
MADISON
Ray, please.
RAY
Guess your hands have been too busy
to pick up.
Ray looks to Gary.
RAY (CONT’D)
Who the fuck is this?
GARY/"RON"
I'm her boyfriend.
RAY
Oh, really? Well, I'm her husband.
MADISON
Ray, can we just keep it --
RAY
Keep it what, Maddy? You tell me.
You tell me, Maddy. You want me to
keep it cordial?
GARY/"RON"
Great. Nice to meet you.
They keep walking.
60.
61.
RAY
Yeah, you too, boyfriend! Madison,
you're pathetic!
He follows them.
RAY (CONT’D)
You know what? No.
RAY'S BUDDY
Ray... Ray!
RAY
No, I'm not done, okay? Just get
the fuck off me. Get the fuck off
me. Hey! I'm just fuckin' around,
guys. C'mon! What, is it a crime
now to have a little fun with your
new friend here?
MADISON
Ray, can you just leave us alone?
RAY
Goddamn it, Madison. Don't walk
away from me. DON'T YOU FUCKING
WALK AWAY FROM ME, YOU UNGRATEFUL BITCH!!
Ray grabs Madison aggressively.
Gary pulls the GUN out and points it at Ray's forehead.
People react.
RAY
SHIT.
GARY/"RON"
Apologize, motherfucker.
Madison is shocked. Then --
MADISON
He said apologize, motherfucker.
He's a professional, he'll do it.
Show him.
Ray sizes up Gary -- doesn't want to be wrong -- starts to
back away.
Gary lowers the gun.
61.
(MORE)
62.
GARY/"RON"
C'mon.
RAY
Professional what? Professional
asshole. Really moving up in the
world, aren't you, Madison? See you
again, professional.
RAY'S BUDDY
C'mon, Ray, let's get outta here.
RAY
You know what? FUCK Y'ALL...
fuckin' deserve each other.
RAY'S BUDDY
C'mon, dude. Get the fuck outta
here.
RAY
Shut the fuck up!
Ray and his friend walk off in the opposite direction.
RAY'S BUDDY
Not fucking cool, man.
INT. LYFT - NIGHT60 60
Gary is still processing what just happened while Madison is
still charged up.
MADISON
I can't get over how amazing that
was! You were incredible. That
entitled fuck doesn't back down for
anybody. Did you see his face?
GARY/"RON"
Yeah...
MADISON
He just walked. That was wild.
GARY/"RON"
(scoffs it off) Well...
MADISON
Alright, cool guy.
(she kisses his cheek
between
words)(MORE)
62.
MADISON (CONT’D)
63.
Nobody has ever stood up for me
like that.
EXT. TED'S FROSTOP - NIGHT61 61
At an outdoor picnic table in one of those 24-Hour-Late-Night-
Eats, Madison and Gary share an ice cream sundae. She's still
bubbling, Gary's a little shaken but putting on a good front.
She holds up her spoon of ice cream.
MADISON
Here. Best date ever.
Gary "toasts" with his spoonful, and eats it.
GARY/"RON"
Wow... that's good.
MADISON
Oh, that is SO good.
GARY/"RON"
So, it seems like you and Ray have
different takes on your divorce.
MADISON
I'm clear - I can't help it if he's
being all crazy. I mean, you saw
how crazy he is.
GARY/"RON"
Yeah. You are divorced, though,
right?
MADISON
Do you see a ring on my finger? DO
you see a ring on my finger?
GARY/"RON"
No. (new thought)
MADISON
Exactly.
GARY/"RON"
It's just like... what are the
chances that the same club we're at
is the same club he's at?
MADISON (CONT’D)
63.
64.
MADISON
Okay, what's up with all these
questions? Fine! I fucked up. I
broke the contract.
(seductively)
But I will happily sign a new one
when we get home...
Just then, Gary glances through the take-out window and sees
Jasper, grabbing an order to go.
He quickly turns away, returning to the sundae.
MADISON (CONT’D)
(off his look)
Right, well... you seem upset.
GARY/"RON"
I'm not upset - me pulling a gun on
some dickhead is not a big deal.
I'm just saying, you don't see me
bringing you to where all my
friends and former lovers are
hanging out. We gotta keep this
clean.
MADISON
It was a coincidence!
JASPER (O.C.)
Whoa. Lookee who's here.
Gary looks up to see Jasper, smiling creepily from ear-to-
ear.
JASPER (CONT’D)
Thought that was you.
Gary has to play it cool even though he's wondering if Jasper
is stalking him.
GARY/"RON"
What's up?
JASPER
Just grabbing some takeout. Saw you
across the way. What are the odds
of this...? This is crazy.
MADISON
Are you gonna introduce me to your
friend?
64.
65.
JASPER
Jasper.
MADISON
Madison.
Jasper knows very clearly WHO she is...
JASPER
Madison, Madison? Madison...Have we
met before? You look so familiar.
MADISON
No, I don't think so.
He subtly looks to Gary and gives a slight smile, although
the "please get the fuck out of here" vibes emanating from
Gary are unmistakeable.
JASPER
Eh, whatever, maybe it'll come to
me...
GARY
Maybe it will.
He relishes Gary's uncomfortable situation for an extra beat,
then let's him off his hook.
JASPER
Okay, well I'll let you guys get
back to your dessert. Just wanted
to say hi. Have a good night. Enjoy
the weekend.
GARY/"RON"
Good to see ya.
JASPER
Alright.
Jasper walks off.
MADISON
Bye!
JASPER
Bye.
MADISON
Now, THAT was a coincidence. Who's
he?
65.
66.
GARY/"RON"
Just some guy I used to work with.
MADISON
Mm... So ex-husband, ex-co-
worker... are we even?
GARY/"RON"
(flirty)
No.
MADISON
Yes. I'll sign the contract again.
EXT. GARY'S CAR - MORNING62 62
Gary pulls up to a lot behind the SHONEY’S parking lot, next
to the van. As he approaches, the door opens, revealing
Claudette, Phil, and Jasper in the back. Gary's a bit
flustered.
GARY
What are we doing? I got no notice,
I got no research, feel like I'm
going in naked.
JASPER
This is when you actually have to
be good at your job. Halloween's
over. No more costumes, man.
PHIL
Alright. We did not get much on
him.
We didn't even have time to get a Title 3 warrant, so it's
audio only.
His name is Mike, he's already in there waiting, and he seems
a little volatile.
JASPER
Ewww... this is gettin' scary.
GARY
Do we even know what this guy looks
like?
CLAUDETTE
No, but he said he'd be the guy
sitting alone reading "Catcher in
the Rye."
66.
67.
PHIL
Which, historically speaking, is
never a good sign.
CLAUDETTE
It's going to be fine, Gary - you
could do this in your sleep. Just
another pussy too scared to do it
himself.
PHIL
You got this, G.
GARY
Okay...
Gary starts to walk away.
JASPER
Enjoy your breakfast.
EXT. SHONEY’S - MORNING63 63
As Gary walks toward the front door, he glances through the
big windows to get a feel for how crowded it is, etc.
He suddenly notices the client, alone in a booth by the
window, reading a book.
...RAY (Madison's ex)...
INT. SHONEY’S - MOMENTS LATER64 64
Gary takes a seat in the empty booth right before Ray's, and
slides over so as to be sitting in a kind of back-to-back
fashion.
GARY
Mike?
Ray begins to turn to the man's voice.
RAY
Uh, yeah. Judd?
GARY
Eyes forward! It’s for your own
protection. So, tell me, Mike, how
can I help you, Mike?
Ray is a little confused, but continues.
67.
68.
RAY
So, you're...
GARY
I am.
RAY
And you...
GARY
I do.
They slightly turn their heads toward one another as they
talk, but never enough to get a good look at each other.
GARY (CONT’D)
So, tell me what you're thinking.
Unless you came here for the
pancakes.
RAY
My wife.
Gary grips the napkin, tries to keep his cool.
GARY
What do you have in mind?
RAY
What do you think? This slut's
killing me. I can't live just
knowing she's out there... with
someone else. So, now I'm here,
with you.
Gary breathes harder.
GARY
So, why do you need me? Why aren't
you taking care of this shit
yourself?
RAY
Believe me, I want to, but we're
going through a divorce right now
and I'd be the number one suspect.
So, I need the perfect front, the
perfect alibi.
GARY
So, you're not technically divorced
yet?
68.
69.
RAY
What's it to you?
(beat)
I forgot to mention, it might be a
twofer.
She's got this new boyfriend... a real douche.
GARY
...and?
RAY
And, if he's there, you can take
him out too.
GARY
I've got no problem with that, but
it's gonna cost you more. You good
with it?
RAY
Yeah, fuck ‘em both.
GARY
Done. You bring the money?
Ray pulls out an envelope.
RAY
Yeah, it's right here. This should
be enough for both of them. I have
a special request though.
GARY
I'm in the service business.
RAY
When you do it, I want her to know
why. Right before you do it, look
her in the eye and say "this is
from your loving husband." I want
that to be the last thing she
fuckin' hears.
Gary slowly turns his head around, quietly speaking to the
back of his head.
GARY
You know what? Maybe I'll throw in
the boyfriend for free.
Ray turns around - recognition.
69.
70.
RAY
What the fuck?
They're soon up on their feet, Gary quietly walking toward a
retreating Ray.
GARY
What? It's very simple - you give
me the money and I'll take care of
it.
RAY
(under his breath as he
leaves)
I'll take care of this shit
myself...
Ray makes a quick exit.
EXT. SHONEY’S - MOMENTS LATER65 65
Gary is walking to the van. The door is open.
CLAUDETTE
The hell was that about?
Gary's mind is moving a million miles a minute.
GARY
I don't know. He just freaked out.
Happens...
CLAUDETTE
Does it?
GARY'S CAR - MOMENTS LATER66 66
Gary gets in, disconnects his hidden mic, and immediately
pulls out his CELL PHONE, dials. Ring, ring, ring, message.
GARY
Madison, if you get this, stay out
of the house. I'm hearing some
stuff about Ray. Call me...
Suddenly, the passenger door opens and Gary hangs up.
JASPER SITS NEXT TO HIM.
JASPER
What the fuck was that?
70.
71.
GARY
What?
JASPER
Guy just bolts out?
GARY
I don't know - he panicked. You
can't win 'em all.
JASPER
No, you sure can't with that
attitude. If they're uneasy, you
put 'em at ease. From my
perspective, you're getting a
little sloppy.
GARY
Maybe so.
(shifts gears)
Look, I wanted to talk with you
about the other night...
JASPER
Oh?? What about it?
Jasper is loving watching Gary squirm and is going to milk it
for all he can.
JASPER (CONT’D)
Oh, her? Hey, I get it, man. All
makes sense to me now. It's cool -
I've fucked my share of suspects.
It's no big deal - it's good for
ya.
GARY
I just ran into her...she was just
thanking me for steering her in the
right direction.
JASPER
Uh huh, I bet she was.
Jasper smiles.
GARY
I just don't want things to get
misconstrued.
JASPER
Gary, you can trust me.
About the most insincere line you've ever heard.
71.

INT.
MADISON'S MASTER CLOSET - DAY67 67
Gary and Madison are in the middle of an intense exchange.
He's attempting to gather her things.
MADISON
Wait, wait, wait... Tell me this
one more time - he's trying to put
a hit out on me?
GARY/"RON"
Yes!
He's trying to hire me to kill you! What do you not get about
that? We gotta go.
MADISON
And he saw you in person?
GARY/"RON"
Yeah.
MADISON
And he knows what you do?
GARY/"RON"
Yeah.
MADISON
So...are you going to kill me?
GARY/"RON"
What are you talking about?
MADISON
Are you gonna kill me?
GARY/"RON"
No.
MADISON
Then I have nothing to worry about.
GARY/"RON"
I think he might do it himself.
She pulls him close.
MADISON
He won't. He won't.
72.
73.
They kiss. He takes a deep breath.
EXT. STUDENT QUAD - DAY68 68
Gary's STUDENTS are standing on a beautiful lawn, broken into
TWO GROUPS.
Gary turns to one group.
GARY
So, I ask the modern day jury, what
is your verdict?
MINDY
We've decided on life without
parole.
GARY
How very modern of you. How did you
arrive at that conclusion?
MINDY
Well, even though we felt this
person is guilty of a heinous act,
we don't think a state-sanctioned
killing accomplishes anything and
only causes more pain and
suffering.
He turns to the other group.
GARY
Okay, a nice example of a legal
system that is set up to respond to
the will of its citizens. Now,
let's jump back in time to our
Paleolithic friends, 25,000 years
ago, where things are very
different. You have no jury, you
have no official legal system -
you're just a nomadic community.
So, what are you going to do about
your problem, this existential
threat in the form of your unhinged
leader who's invading other tribes,
he's killing, he's raping, he's
pillaging, seems like he's going to
get you all killed? What're your
options?
73.
74.
MELANIE
We're kinda mixed. Some us think we
should exile him --
PETER
We don't have the means to exile
him. We gonna put him on a boat?
JERREN
The MAJORITY OF US want to
eliminate him. Whatever we have to
do for our own survival.
GARY
Woo, don't mess with Jerren. So,
how do you solve this problem?
PETER
Execution.
GARY
Ruthless...but historically,
potentially the right choice.
There's been a lot of scholarship
on this very subject recently. And
the NEW THINKING is that these kind
of targeted killings actually play
a larger part in our social
evolution than previously thought.
This impulse to weed out these
destabilizing forces is likely a
dark thread in our historical DNA.
These killings are thought to have
ultimately served a twofold purpose
- they not only protected social
coherence and norms, but ALSO
eliminated a certain kind of
abusive and uncooperative person
from the gene pool.
(to Jerren and Peter)
Melanie leans over to her
girlfriend.
MELANIE
When did our professor get hot?
GIRLFRIEND
I know.
INT. POLICE STATION - DAY69 69
Toward the end of their weekly meeting:
74.
75.
SERGEANT HANK
...and you'll get those reports
over to headquarters this
afternoon?
Phil gives a thumbs up.
SERGEANT HANK (CONT’D)
(to Claudette)
They know about the body?
CLAUDETTE
No - I haven't had a chance to tell
them yet.
JASPER
What body?
SERGEANT HANK
You remember the lady that came in,
trying to have her husband killed,
that we let go?
JASPER
No, that HE let go.
CLAUDETTE
Madison Figueroa Masters.
PHIL
The one you were Ron.
CLAUDETTE
Yeah, her husband was just found
dead.
W T F. Gary's mind is racing.
GARY
I'm sorry... What happened? Where?
SERGEANT HANK
The body was found in Cabbage Alley
off Chef Menteur.
CLAUDETTE
Possible drug deal gone bad. Single
bullet to the aorta.
A .38.
Gary looks like he's going to be sick - struggles to choose
his words.
75.
76.
SERGEANT HANK
Gary?
GARY
Yeah, when I was researching her,
the guy seemed like he had a lot of
drug problems... Any suspects?
CLAUDETTE
Not really. Sounds like she and the
husband got into it outside of a
bar called Virgo's, and then the
guy she was with pulled a gun on
him.
HANK
Did we ID that guy?
CLAUDETTE
Not yet.
JASPER
Maybe it's a new boyfriend or
something? Should we go try to find
this guy, talk to him?
Jasper looks to Gary.
SERGEANT HANK
I'm liking that. Let us know what
you find out.
JASPER
I think Johnson and I should tag-
team this. Is it alright if I bring
him?
SERGEANT HANK
Sure.
CLAUDETTE
Are you cool with it, Gary?
GARY
Yeah.
INT. JASPER'S CAR - DAY70 70
Jasper and Gary are silent as they drive, into the alley of
the nightclub where it all went down.
76.
77.
EXT. VIRGO'S NIGHTCLUB ALLEY - CONTINUOUS71 71
As Gary stands outside the car, Jasper is strangely on all
fours, looking under the car.
GARY
What are you doing?
JASPER
Looking for the boyfriend...
Jasper continues to sniff like a bloodhound, bringing him to
Gary's shoe.
JASPER (CONT’D)
Oh shit! Found him!
He stands up.
JASPER (CONT’D)
Fuuuck. I'm good.
GARY
C'mon. What are we doing here?
JASPER
Hey, look... I'm not going to tell
anybody.
GARY
Tell 'em what?! So I ran into her
again - doesn't mean I'm the
boyfriend, doesn't mean I have
anything to do with anything.
Jasper reaches into his back pocket and pulls out a picture,
something he printed.
JASPER
Whoa, whoa. So defensive. Look,
nobody's accusing you of anything.
I was just wondering if you knew
this guy? Does he look familiar?
He shows him a PHOTO OF RAY. Looks like Gary has to play some
cards right.
GARY
Yeah, that's the guy that ran out
of the restaurant... was his name
Mike?
JASPER
Ray... Madison's husband, right?
77.
78.
GARY
Right.
JASPER
You see, I went back and listened
to that conversation that you guys
had, and it just took on a whole
different layer of meaning for me.
You really knew what button to push
with that whole boyfriend line,
huh?
GARY
What are you getting at?
JASPER
Nothing. Look, we're friends,
right, Gary? I'll let you in on
something, over the years, I've
sort of learned to follow my nose
on these hunches that I have and -
usually something turns up pretty
interesting... valuable.
GARY
Let me know what you find.
Jasper has him -- so why isn't he going in for the kill...?
JASPER
Maybe. Well, I don't know...
There's nothing here.
INT. MADISON'S BUNGALOW - DAY72 72
Gary walks in quietly. Getting milk out of the refrigerator,
at first Madison doesn't see him.
MADISON
You scared me!
Tries to read her.
GARY/"RON"
Hi.
MADISON
Why are you looking at me like
that?
GARY/"RON"
Like what?
78.
79.
MADISON
You're looking at me like
something's wrong.
GARY/"RON"
IS something wrong? Anything out of
the ordinary?
MADISON
Okay, what are you doing? Look,
Ron, it's too early for this shit.
GARY/"RON"
Did you hear about Ray?
Madison stops.
MADISON
That he's dead? Yeah - how do you
know that?
GARY/"RON"
I just know. Were you ever going to
tell me?
You just didn't think it would come up?
MADISON
Yeah, but who told you?
His phone rings. He briefly checks it and then silences.
GARY/"RON"
This is sort of my area. I listen
to police scanners, I tend to know
who's being killed in this town.
I'm wondering if you're okay. Cause
you seem weirdly okay.
MADISON
I was obviously going to tell you,
but I'm still just processing it
all. I really don't know what to do
with it. It's a weird position to
be in. Am I supposed to be playing
the role of grieving widow? Well, I
don't know how to pretend. Was he a
good guy? No. Did I love him? I
mean, I loved him. People grieve in
different ways.
(new thought)
I just have to know if you had
anything to do with this.
79.
80.
He can't believe the question and is kinda pissed at her for
the insinuation.
GARY/"RON"
Why the fuck would I have anything
to do with it? What motive? I’m the
one that talked you OUT of killing
him in the first place, remember?
You think I’m just out there on my
own killing people, for no money?
MADISON
Okay, I just had to ask. I'm sorry.
GARY
It's okay... I understand.
Madison breaks down. She buries her face in Gary's shoulder,
sobbing.
MADISON
I'm really happy you're here.
Gary consoles her.
GARY
Me too. So what happened? Did the
police call you to let you know?
MADISON
Yeah.
GARY
And what are they saying? Any
suspects? Arrests?
MADISON
I think there was a drug deal going
on.
They just found him shot.
She starts crying again. He hugs her.
MADISON (CONT’D)
I'm so scared.
GARY
I know, it's so weird, so out of
the blue. You don't have to be
scared. Why would you be scared?
MADISON
Because I killed him.
80.
81.
GARY/"RON"
You killed him?!
MADISON
Yeah.
Gary's phone RINGS, he silences it.
GARY/"RON"
Why would you do that?!
MADISON
You told me yourself, he was gonna
come and kill me!
GARY/"RON"
So, he was attacking you, like self-
defense.
MADISON
Technically...
GARY/"RON"
Technically, what? What was he
doing?
MADISON
He was either passed out or asleep.
GARY/"RON"
And you KILLED HIM?!
MADISON
Yeah, and I made a story, and
they're believing it.
GARY/"RON"
OH MY GOD...OH MY GOD!
MADISON
Why are you getting so worked up
about this? You do this shit all
the time.
GARY/"RON"
I don't do this all the time. I've
never done this. I'VE NEVER KILLED
ANYONE.
MADISON
What are you talking about?
81.
82.
GARY/"RON"
I'm a fake hitman. That's why I
didn't put you away, I didn't have
you arrested. Because, I was
working undercover.
MADISON
You're a cop?!
GARY/"RON"
No. I teach at a college. This
hitman thing's just a part-time gig
that's... gotten out of hand.
MADISON
You've been lying to me this whole
time?!
GARY/"RON"
I was stuck. I didn't want to lose
you, and you met Ron first, and you
liked Ron... I liked Ron. So, I
didn't want to show you Gary.
MADISON
Who the fuck is Gary?
GARY/"RON"
I'm Gary.
MADISON
I don't even know your name!!
GARY/"RON"
My real name is Gary Johnson.
MADISON
Gary?
GARY/"RON"
I know!
The phone RINGS. He looks at it: CLAUDETTE.
GARY/"RON" (CONT’D)
They've called three times -
something must be going on... a
situation probably...
He answers.
GARY/"RON" (CONT’D)
Hey, how's it going, Claude?
82.
83.
CLAUDETTE (ON PHONE)
Gary, where are you?! We need you
back at the station now.
GARY/"RON"
Now?
CLAUDETTE (ON PHONE)
Yes, now. We got a new development
on this Madison Masters.
GARY/"RON"
Okay...I'll be right there.
Hangs up.
GARY/"RON" (CONT’D)
I'm sorry, I'm gonna, I gotta
handle something really quickly and
then I'm gonna be right back...
MADISON
Don't.
Just leave, whatever your name is.
GARY (V.O.)
I might have walked in as Ron, but
I left as Gary.
INT. BRIEFING ROOM - POLICE STATION - DAY73 73
Gary walks into the police station. Jasper approaches him
with a cup of coffee.
JASPER
Johnson's here!
Phil, briefing room.
They soon are all entering, Phil pulling up the rear.
JASPER (CONT’D)
Wait till you hear this.
PHIL
Hey! Lookin' good Gary.
Phil gestures to Gary's "Ron" clothing.
CLAUDETTE
Glad you could make it.
83.
84.
Hank, Claudette, Phil, and Jasper are dialed in. They know
something Gary doesn't.
SERGEANT HANK
This is looking more and more like
we messed this up. Madison Figueroa
is now the number one suspect.
GARY/"RON"
Really?!
SERGEANT HANK
Really. Have a seat.
(to Claudette)
Tell him what we just found out.
CLAUDETTE
About 6 months ago, Ray Masters
increased his life insurance policy
by one million dollars. A policy in
which, of course, the wife was
named the sole beneficiary.
GARY/"RON"
Hmmmm...
PHIL
The policy pre-dates her initial
solicitation attempt, but homicide
now thinks there might be some
connective tissue here. Maybe after
your meeting, she coerced someone
else to do it, or she did it
herself.
JASPER
(to group)
That's what happens when you let
someone off the hook.
CLAUDETTE
Not helpful.
SERGEANT HANK
That's a long time ago.
A sphinx-like Jasper kicks it up a notch.
JASPER
Gary, did you ever talk to her
again after that time at The Please
U?
84.
(MORE)
85.
What's Jasper up to with this line of questioning, these
questions he knows the answers to?
GARY/"RON"
Yeah. Actually, I did.
CLAUDETTE
You did? When?
GARY/"RON"
Yeah, I ran into her at Ted's
Frostop. She just thanked me for
helping her out, giving her good
advice.
(calls Jasper's bluff)
Actually, that was the same night I
ran into you. You talked to her.
CLAUDETTE
You talked to her, too?
JASPER
Oh... I didn't realize that was
her.
GARY
Yeah, that was Madison.
JASPER
Huh...
CLAUDETTE
Huh. So, do you think she could be
involved in his murder?
GARY
There's always a chance, but I
would be very surprised. She just
seemed so happy. She left her
husband, got her own place, just
seemed like she was doing really
well.
SERGEANT HANK
So, what are we doin' next here,
guys?
JASPER
Well, we could pull her in for
questioning anytime, but she'll
probably just get a lawyer, clam
up...if she's really behind this,
she's probably got all her lies and
alibis in order.
(MORE)
85.
JASPER (CONT’D)
(MORE)
86.
I'm thinking we got a one-time
opportunity to maybe get the
unvarnished story from her.
THIS GUY.
GARY
Me?
JASPER
Yeah. Question: when you ran into
her, were you Gary or were you the
hitman - which one were you going
under on that one?
GARY
Ron.
JASPER
Okay, so you're still Ron the
hitman to her?
GARY
Who else would I be?
JASPER
This is great. Look - she forever
knows that he knows that she wanted
to kill the guy, and she must like
him or trust him enough to be
sharing a Sundae at Ted's Frostop.
(to group)
Let's face it - they got the goods
on each other, I mean, she'd never
in a million years suspect he's
recording their conversation. I
think we got an opportunity here.
Gary's heart sinks as he sees where this is going.
CLAUDETTE
So we manufacture a random
encounter where he can get her
talking.
JASPER
Not random - surprise encounter.
I
say we put a wire on Gary and we go
now. I'm thinking you can just play
this as just a concerned check-in.
JASPER (CONT’D)
(MORE)
86.
I (CONT’D)
87.
You read about the husband's death,
and you're up front about why you
want to talk with her.
SERGEANT HANK
I'm liking this. There's no tellin'
what she'll say, but once you get
her talking, you'll be able to tell
if she's lying to you.
JASPER
Exactly.
CLAUDETTE
You good with that, Gary?
Gary and Jasper lock eyes. He can't believe this is
happening, but has to go along.
GARY
I think it's a good plan. Very
good. So, you send me the address,
I'll meet you over there. Let's
nail her.
JASPER
I'll ride with you. Get you
prepped. See you guys in the van.
INT. GARY'S CAR - DAY74 74
Gary drives while Jasper sits shotgun.
JASPER
You good?
GARY/"RON"
Yeah.
JASPER
Okay. (laughs) You're making me
nervous.
EXT. SURVEILLANCE VAN - DAY
Gary pulls up next to the surveillance van and is handed an
earpiece.
CLAUDETTE
Really? Does he need that?
I (CONT’D)
87.
88.
JASPER
Yeah, I want to be in his ear on
this one.
PHIL
Go get her, Ron!
Phil holds out his fist for a fist-bump, which Jasper knocks
away. Gary walks away and Jasper pulls out the mic.
JASPER
Hey. I got you.
He winks and shuts the door, leaving Gary with his thoughts.
EXT. MADISON'S BUNGALOW - DAY75 75
Gary walks down St. Roch Street as he adjusts his earpiece
and types away frantically on his phone.
He takes a deep breath as he approaches Madison's.
GARY
You guys there?
INT. UNDERCOVER VAN - DAY76 76
Claudette, Phil and Jasper are in the van. Gary's voice comes
through his earwig.
GARY (O.S.)
Can you guys hear me?
CLAUDETTE
Loud and clear.
PHIL
Your ears working?
GARY
Yep.
PHIL
Great - remember, audio only -
gotta get a good recording.
GARY
Got it.
88.
89.
INT. MADISON'S BUNGALOW - DAY77 77
From Madison's POV, she whips the door open.
GARY/"RON"
We gotta talk...
Gary walks in and continues talking, as he shows her a notes
doc on his PHONE SCREEN: "Police are listening. Follow my
lead. We're on the same team."
GARY/"RON" (CONT’D)
..there's a bunch of shit coming
down that we gotta figure out quick
or we are both fucked.
MADISON
Wait, what?!
IN THE HOUSE
She keeps reading: “I'm still Ron. We're not dating.”
GARY/"RON"
Look, people know I handle shit
around here, so because of that
meeting we had that one time, I'm
catching heat for the death of your
husband - they're thinking one of
us did it.
MADISON
Well it wasn't me!
He points to the phone and she continues reading: “You are
innocent. Deny. Deny. Deny.”
GARY/"RON"
Look, I know you did it. It's
fuckin' obvious, and I don't
blame...
MADISON
I didn't kill him! Who's accusing
me of this? This is bullshit! You
out of all people should know I
wasn't capable of this!
GARY/"RON"
Okay, then so who did? What the
hell happened?
89.
90.
MADISON
I just know what they've told me...
INT. POLICE SURVEILLANCE VAN.
We see Jasper and Phil listening on headphones.
GARY/"RON" (ON RADIO)
Which is what?
MADISON (ON RADIO)
He got shot buying drugs! Guy was
an addict!
IN THE HOUSE
Gary points to his phone: "They know about gun outside
Virgo’s. Can't be me..."
GARY/"RON"
Okay, so you say you didn't kill
him.
When was the last time you
saw him?
MADISON
Not that long ago, at Virgo's.
GARY/"RON"
The club?
MADISON
Yes, the club. I was walking out of
Virgo's with this guy that I met on
the dance floor and boom, I run
into Ray. Ray loses his shit when
he sees me with this other guy and
starts running his mouth, gets all
threatening, and fucking grabs
me...And then this other guy,
trying to protect me, he pulls out
a gun out of nowhere and sticks it
in Ray’s face...
JASPER (IN EARPIECE)
Find out more about the guy with
the gun.
90.
91.
MADISON
... Ray freaks out, he leaves, I
just run away... and that was the
last time I saw him.
Gary points to the prompt: "NOT ME."
GARY/"RON"
So, who's this guy who pulled the
gun? What's his name?
Madison hesitates, looks to Gary for help. He gives her the
"keep going, all good" sign.
MADISON
I don't know.
GARY/"RON"
You don't know his name?
MADISON
I don't know his name. We were
having fun on the dance floor, I
asked him if he wanted to go
somewhere else. He said yes. We
walked out, all that stuff with Ray
happened. So, you know what, if he
said his name, I didn't hear it.
GARY/"RON"
So, you don't know his name, you're
just leaving the club with some
random stranger you just met?
MADISON
Hey, fuck off. I'm a grown woman.
I'm single, and he wasn't random.
He was a damn good dancer.
GARY/"RON"
Well, I'm happy for you. Cause your
mystery man...he's a suspect.
INT. POLICE SURVEILLANCE VAN.
We see Jasper and Phil listening on headphones.
GARY/"RON" (ON RADIO)
I'm hearing they're looking for
him...
JASPER
Nail her on the insurance policy.
91.
92.
IN THE HOUSE
Gary begins typing...
MADISON
Shit, so am I. Good men are rare
these days. He stood up for me, he
protected me. So, you know what? If
they find him, you let me know.
Gary smiles at this. A romantic moment in the hot seat.
Gary shows her his phone: "They know about insurance policy.
Put it on Ray."
GARY/"RON"
You know, that first time we met at
the Please U, your motive didn't
seem financial, like a lot of these
other pieces of shit I work for.
MADISON
Yeah, because it wasn't.
GARY/"RON"
Then what about this million dollar
insurance policy everyone knows
about?
Madison's eyes widen at this amount. Gary indicates "settle
down."
GARY/"RON" (CONT’D)
-- Don't act like a million dollars
is nothing. Don't fucking lie to
me. You know what I'm capable of.
MADISON
Ray's family has money - they do
shit like this, they take out
insurance. Look, I don't even know
if I get any of that money. For all
I know, he changed the beneficiary
when we broke up.
Gary begins to type...
MADISON (CONT’D)
Listen, I have no mind for
financial stuff - Ray would talk
about money and investments and
shit like that, and it would just
go over my head.
92.
(MORE)
93.
Gary shows her his PHONE: "Big Finale. Don't hold back. Kick
me out."
GARY/"RON"
So, you're giving me all the
answers, but you're not giving me
the right answers.
MADISON
I'm giving you the truth!
GARY/"RON"
I still know you did it.
MADISON
Fuck you! I didn't do it. How dare
you come into my own house and
accuse me. You know what?! Get the
fuck outta my house!
GARY/"RON"
Hey, I'm on your side - that is why
I'm here. I'm trying to help you
get away with this. Not because I'm
some great guy or anything, but as
soon as the heat's off you, it's
off of me, too. We can dig our way
out of this mess together.
MADISON
There is no together!
GARY/"RON"
I can push this whole thing off on
someone else, but before I do that,
you have to tell me the truth so I
can get this right.
MADISON
You know what? I'm done. I'm done
answering questions from a fucking
hitman. You’re not a cop - let them
find out who really did it - I’ve
told you everything that I know! I
had nothing to do with this! Ray
was a druggie loser asshole. Now
get the fuck out of my house.
Gary drifts toward door.
GARY/"RON"
Hey! Last time, I'm offering you a
way out. (MORE)
93.
GARY/"RON" (CONT’D)
94.
After I walk out of this door,
you're on your own. I coulda
helped.
MADISON
Good - I don't need it.
GARY/"RON"
And as far as we know, they could
be watching us right now, so we
should probably never see each
other again.
MADISON
Great.
GARY/"RON"
If you see me publicly, don't say
hi. Nothing personal. We just gotta
keep this clean.
MADISON
Fine by me.
Gary winks at her as he leaves out the front door. She stares
in disbelief.
MADISON (CONT’D)
(Quietly whispers) Fuck.
INT. UNDERCOVER VAN - DAY78 78
The door opens and Gary is there, post-meeting.
CLAUDETTE
What'd you think?
GARY
What did YOU think?
Gary looks from face to face, staring at him, the tension is
thick.
CLAUDETTE
You gave her plenty of rope to hang
herself.
PHIL
She's either the best liar we've
ever encountered...or she's
innocent.
GARY/"RON" (CONT’D)
94.
95.
CLAUDETTE
Damnit, I thought it was her.
PHIL
Yeah, me too.
GARY
Yeah, she seemed pretty honest in
there.
CLAUDETTE
What about you, Jasper?
Jasper looks to Gary, a small knowing grin.
JASPER
Yeah, I tend to agree. I don't
think she did it. Great work in
there, Gary.
Gary reads Jasper, and decides to really challenge him.
GARY
So, this mystery guy, the one who
pulled the gun on him? Should we
try to hunt that guy down?
Jasper almost appreciates the brazenness.
JASPER
Nah, he just seems like some guy
who pulled a gun on an asshole in
an alleyway. Nothing much happened.
CLAUDETTE
Yeah, we're done here.
INT. GARY'S CAR - NIGHT79 79
Gary drives alone in his car, deep in thought.
Paranoia prevails - he checks his rearview mirror, sees if
he's being tailed.
INT. MADISON'S BUNGALOW - NIGHT80 80
Gary opens the door to find JASPER sitting on a chair in
Madison's living room, drinking a beer, while she sits across
from him, not reacting much.

JASPER
Oh my god! Yeah! There he is. The
man himself. I figured you’d be
coming by here, man. C’mon,
celebration beer?
Jasper gets up and heads to the kitchen.
JASPER (CONT’D)
I'm gonna get you a beer.
(to Madison)
You got it the first time, I got
it.
MADISON
I'll get it.
JASPER
She's awesome.
GARY
So, what's going on, Jasper?
JASPER
I was literally just telling
Madison what phenomenal actors you
guys are. So, I had to get
backstage, poke my head inside the
green room. Your performance was
flawless, but you, you my friend,
knocked my fucking socks off. Maybe
I never gave you enough credit,
Gary. Or... Ron. Sorry.
Gary...Ron...
(to Madison)
I get them mixed up sometimes. Do
you?
MADISON
Sometimes.
GARY/"RON"
What the fuck is going on?
JASPER
I was literally just telling the
lovely Madison that I was going to
be fine with whatever way it went
this afternoon. If it all blew up
in your face, well, at least I'd
get my job back.

JASPER (CONT’D)
97.
But, if you got away with it,
which, congratulations, it seems
like you did, then I would just
have to settle for a fuck-ton of
money.
Madison remains quiet while Gary tries to figure all this
out.
JASPER (CONT’D)
This is where you'd go "what money,
Jasper?" or "money from where?" and
then I would say "the dead
husband's insurance policy." Okay.
This'll be our little
understanding, okay? The one that
keeps me silent, and you guys out
of prison.
Gary slowly moves in on Jasper.
GARY
You got nothing, Jasper...
JASPER
Well, I...
GARY
Because there isn't anything. That
we're dating?
JASPER
Oh shit, I didn't know that.
Congratulations.
GARY (OVERLAPPING) (CONT’D)
You think anybody gives a
shit? You've already played
your hand here, so fuck you,
get lost!
In his face, about to get physical.
MADISON
Hey!! Stop. Stay. Babe, sit down.
We're gonna hear him out.
JASPER
Yeah, babe, you're being a... dick.
Gary goes over to couch.
JASPER (CONT’D)
I'm just trying to help you guys
out.
GARY
Help us out?
JASPER (CONT’D)
97.
98.
JASPER
Oh, Jesus Christ, Gary! Enough.
Ok?! Enough! Ok?! Cut the bullshit.
Here, I'll go first, alright? I've
been following both of you. And
I'll be even more honest, I wanted
my job back. Nothing against you
personally, ok, but holy shit! I've
got enough evidence to put you away
for life, and you... accomplice to
murder? Whoooa dogggie. You're
gonna be there for a while, and the
only reason that I'm 100 percent
sure you did it, is because I'm 100
percent sure that your Mr. Tough
Guy here couldn't fucking kill a
thing.
Jasper starts swaying. He takes off his jacket.
JASPER (CONT’D)
This house is hot.
Gary looks confused. Jasper braces himself on the table as he
struggles to get words out.
JASPER (CONT’D)
Ironically, life insurance might
have actually saved you guys here.
That money got me thinking that
this dark, fucking adventure that
we've all been on can actually have
a happy ending.
Jasper continues to push through his words.. Clearly
struggling to breathe... bracing himself on the coffee table.
Gary blinks in confusion. Something is happening.
JASPER (CONT’D)
The day you hand over the cash...is
the...
He's getting more and more disorientated... He trails off.
JASPER (CONT’D)
Oh, man...
Jasper slides, knee to the floor, struggling to hold himself
up.
JASPER (CONT’D)
Fuck.
Jasper fully falls on the floor, unconscious.
98.
99.
Madison and Gary sit on the couch, trying to process what
just happened. Madison peeks over the coffee table.
MADISON
I'm fucked.
GARY
What just happened?
MADISON
I put drugs in his beer. I hope I
didn't over-do it... if he wakes
up, I'm going to jail... I drugged
a cop. I'm so fucked.
ON GARY, his mind moving...
...he moves toward the kitchen, walks with purpose...
MADISON (CONT’D)
What are you doing?
Gary returns with a WINN-DIXIE BAG.
MADISON (CONT’D)
What's that for?
Gary ties that bag around Jasper's head.
GARY
Commitment.
Madison realizes what's in process.
MADISON
We can't get away with killing a
cop.
A glint in Gary's eye...one we haven't seen...
GARY/"RON"
Not usually, but for Jasper these
days, I'm thinking we can. I mean,
the police are probably thinking
about him the way we are right now -
they'd just be better off if he
wasn't around anymore.
Madison looks at Jasper with his head covered in the bag and
walks to the kitchen in disgust.
99.
100.
MADISON
Oh God.
(beat)
So... what's our story?
GARY/"RON"
He gets found in his car in a
remote area. Drugs in his system...
a bag over his head... no
contusions or signs of struggle...
clearly a suicide. I mean, his wife
left him years ago - so no one to
question the story... He's a
racist, misogynistic, abusive,
dirty, dirty cop. Fuck him.
MADISON
Are we really doing this?
GARY
We don't have a choice.
(beat)
Look, I know you're taking a big
leap with me and there are some
factual loose threads we'll be
dealing with. But I think I'm in
love with you.
MADISON
It's always a leap... And for the
record, I think I'm in love with
you, too. For better or worse?
GARY/"RON"
(looking at Jasper)
And we can agree this is kind of
the worst, right?
A gasp from Jasper.
MADISON
Right.
They once again find themselves staring at Jasper's heaving
body.
GARY
So, we're in this till the end?
Till death us do part?
MADISON
Yes, because I don't believe in
divorce.
100.
(MORE)
101.
Gary freezes.
MADISON (CONT’D)
I'm kidding.
She pulls him close. They turn away from Jasper and stare
into each other's eyes, as if exchanging wedding vows.
MADISON (CONT’D)
So, do we agree on the terms?
GARY/"RON"
I do.
MADISON
I do.
GARY/"RON"
Where do I sign?
She points to her lips. He kisses them.
GARY/"RON" (CONT’D)
Anywhere else I need to sign?
Points to her chest.
MADISON
Initial here.
He moves lower.
GARY/"RON"
We gotta make sure...this
document...is air tight. There's a
little place down here I need to
initial.
As they fall out of the bottom of the frame, we can hear the
sounds of a honeymoon beginning as we settle on Jasper's
unconscious body.
He twitches...then stills.
INT. LECTURE HALL - DAY81 81
Gary stands in front of a packed assembly hall.
GARY
I know I've thrown a lot at you
this semester, but that's the
point, isn't it?
(MORE)
101.
GARY (CONT’D)
102.
To be inundated, overwhelmed by
perspectives and possibilities,
because that is what life is
offering you if you choose to look
at it that way. And I didn't always
- I used to believe that reality
was objective, immutable, we were
all just kind of stuck, in a
Plato/Descartes/Kant sort of way,
but over the years, I've come to
believe that the truth is created
through the integration of
different points of view, and there
are no absolutes, whether moral or
epistemological. Now, I find this
to be a much more empowering way to
go through life, this notion that
if the universe is not fixed, then
neither are you, and you really can
become a different and hopefully
better person. Now, the one thing I
know for certain is your reality
will change over time, in ways you
cannot even imagine, and I urge you
to be open for this transformation.
So, as we close out this semester,
if I have one piece of advice for
you moving forward in this
complicated world, it is this:
seize the identity you want for
yourself, and whoever you decide to
be after this class, be them with
abandon and passion.
A "whoop" comes from one of the students in the class,
followed by laughter.
GARY (CONT’D)
Best of luck to all of you on your
final exam. You may begin.
INT. SCHOOL CAFETERIA - DAY82 82
A little later, Gary holds GWEN (6) while Madison is working
out some details with another PTA MOM.
GARY
You see all those white birds out
there? Notice the long, orange
bill, right? That is the white
ibis. Look at those eyes... crazy.
GARY (CONT’D)
102.
103.
PTA MOM
Alright, so I know we have the
croissants and I know we have the
cupcakes. Are you bringing the
apple pie?
MADISON
Yeah, I'm bringing Gary's famous
apple pie.
PTA MOM
That's wonderful.
MADISON
And don't worry about the costumes -
I got it.
PTA MOM
Thank God. You're the best,
Madison. Thank you. We were hoping
someone would step in there and
help. Gabby just bailed for Aspen.
I could've literally strangled her
to death.
PTA MOM and Madison laugh.
PTA MOM (CONT’D)
Anyway, I'll see you next meeting.
EXT./INT. NICE NEIGHBORHOOD - EVENING83 83
They now have a cool house in a good neighborhood.
Between dinner and dessert, Gary scrapes some excess
spaghetti into the compost container.
GARY (V.O.)
As love can do, somewhere along the
way, it changed me. I eventually
found the proper cocktail of Gary
and Ron. After all, life is short.
You gotta live on your own terms.
At the dinner table, we realize they also have a 3-YEAR-OLD-
BOY, sitting in a kid's chair. Gary brings over a pie and
drops it on the table.
GWEN
(so innocent)
Mommy, where did you meet Daddy?
103.
104.
Gary sits down and they look at each other, the smile
replaced with a curious look. We knew this day was coming,
but...
MADISON
Well, daddy was the nicest guy I'd
ever met, even though he was being
all tough, I could tell it was an
act.
GARY
And your mother, well, what can I
say, it was love at first sight...
she ended up making a new man out
of me... But to answer your
question, we met at a magical
little place called the Please U
Cafe.
Gary takes a bite from the apple pie.
MADISON
Are you enjoying your pie?
GARY
All pie is good pie.
MADISON
It sure is.
