Ani slows down."}, {"character": "DIAMOND (CONT'D)", "dialogue": "Two weeks on the fucking nose. Ani turns and... explodes. She swings and charges Diamond. Igor tries to intercept but Ani is too fast. Ani tackles Diamond and their bodies hit the floor. Toros holds on to Ivan for dear life. Everybody tries to stop the fight making the moment even more chaotic. Full on brawl. Igor, Garnik, Jimmy, Dawn and a security guard are doing their best to stop it. Some girls are coming to Diamond's defense while Lulu and others defend Ani. Punches and kicks. A table is pushed over, glasses shattering on the floor. In the back lap dance area, three topless dances including Sunny react to the noise. Back on the floor..."}, {"character": "JIMMY", "dialogue": "Cut it! Eddie! Cut it!
