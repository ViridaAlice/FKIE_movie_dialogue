On black: “Rio de Janeiro - 1970
Under a military dictatorship.”
The low, unsettling thud of helicopter blades starts
encroaching on the movie theater.
EXT. SEA OFF LEBLON BEACH - DAY
Dark blue, the sea fills the screen. Down below, just past
the breakers, a woman is bobbing in the water.
EUNICE PAIVA, 40, slim and elegant in a discreet black
bathing suit, floats with her eyes closed.
Her ears in the water, her expression serene, she hears the
muffled noise coming closer. The helicopter's shadow passes
over her, and she opens her eyes.
The expanse of blue sky is broken by the military aircraft.
Eunice shields her eyes against the sun and watches the
chopper skirt the packed beach, flying low.
EXT. LEBLON BEACH - DAY
The helicopter flies over the sand, which is dotted with
SWIMMERS and SURFERS in colorful suits. Among them, MARCELO,
9, is kicking a soccer ball around with a group of boys.
At the net nearby, his sister ELIANA, 15, gets ready to serve
in a volleyball match with her friends.
A skittish PUPPY scampers through the forest of legs. It runs
out ahead and interrupts the match.
BEACHGOER (O.S.)
Whose mutt is that?
VOLLEYBALL FRIEND (O.S.)
Get it off the court!
Eliana's hands enter the shot and grab the mutt.
ELIANA
Is he yours?
PASSERBY (O.S.)
No.
She unceremoniously hands the dog over to her brother.
1.
2.
ELIANA
Marcelo, hold him. He's messing up
the game.
Eliana goes back to the match. Clutching the dog, Marcelo
runs over to his other sister NALU, 13. She and her friend
CRISTINA, 13, are rubbing Coke on their skin.
MARCELO
Check out our new puppy.
NALU
Mom won't let you keep that
fleabag.
MARCELO
Where is she?
NALU
Dunno.
Nalu and Cristina go back to their Coke tanning ritual.
CRISTINA
Dalal will kill us if we show up
tanned at the ballet.
NALU
That's what face powder's for.
Marcelo looks over at Eunice bobbing out in the surf, but
runs off in the opposite direction with a mischievous grin.
We follow as he and his friends run across the beachside
avenue. At the net, Eliana looks worriedly over.
ELIANA
Careful on the street!
The boys trot toward a two storey house on a corner, with
green windows and open doors.
EXT. PAIVA FAMILY HOME - DAY
The boys' sandy feet scamper through the garage, past a red
OPEL KADETT. Marcelo, dog in hands, leads his gang up to the
door to the living room.
INT. PAIVA FAMILY HOME / DINING ROOM - DAY
MARIA JOSÉ, 30, the aproned maid, and BABIU, 8, are setting
the table. As soon as she hears the boys coming:
2.
3.
MARIA JOSÉ
Wipe your feet. I just swept the
house.
They scuff the sand off their feet. Babiu notices the puppy.
BABIU
Can I hold him?
MARIA JOSÉ
What on earth is this now?
MARCELO
Our new puppy.
MARIA JOSÉ
It’s filthy. Does your mom know
about this?
MARCELO
Is Dad here?
MARIA JOSÉ
In the office, with Mr. Bocayuva.
Don't bother him.
MARCELO
It's urgent.
Babiu and Marcelo run through the cozy LIVING ROOM, its walls
covered with abstract paintings, an elegant china cabinet
against one wall. They come up to the closed study door.
INT. PAIVA FAMILY HOME / STUDY - DAY
RUBENS PAIVA, a stout man of 40, cigar protruding from his
mustache, studies a blueprint. By his side is "BABY"
BOCAYUVA, 50, his business partner and friend.
BOCA
It was crazy to take on a project
this size.
RUBENS
If it were easy, we wouldn't have
taken it on.
BOCA
I would've.
RUBENS
I know you would.
3.
4.
They both chuckle. There's a knock at the door.
RUBENS (CONT'D)
Come in.
Babiu and Marcelo emerge, dog in arms.
RUBENS (CONT'D)
No, no dog in the house. No way.
MARCELO
Can we keep him? Please?
RUBENS
What did Mom say?
Babiu looks to her brother, who doesn't blink.
MARCELO
She said to ask you.
RUBENS
What's this got to do with me?
(to Boca)
You take him.
BOCA
Me? No way. Dalal will kick me out.
Rubens can't resist the puppy's charms, and takes him.
RUBENS
I think this little rascal here looks
like a...
I/E. PIMPÃO'S DODGE CHARGER - LATE AFTERNOON
VEROCA
Pimpão! Let me do it, I know how.
VEROCA, 17, tries to put a film cartridge into a Super 8
camera. Next to her, PIMPÃO, 19, is driving with one hand as
he tries to grab the camera with the other.
PIMPÃO
If it doesn't click, it won't
shoot.
Veroca dodges him, turns the cartridge over and slots it in.
In the backseat, HELENA, 17, rolls a joint and REYNALDO, 20,
flips through a Pasquim, a counterculture magazine.
4.
5.
The stereo breaks into a rhythmic tune: Jimmy, Renda-se by
Tom Zé. Veroca turns the sound all the way up. Helena lights
the joint. Pimpão puts his foot on the gas.
Veroca sings along and brings the camera up to her eye.
SUPER 8 FOOTAGE
The song continues over the scenes framed by Veroca's Super
8, out of the car window:
Vendors hawking their wares, a cluster of men cheering at a
corner bar, workers nodding off on a packed bus. Living
fragments of the human geography of Rio in the '70s.
Veroca frames a YOUNG COUPLE with long hair on a motorcycle
alongside the car. We're led along the streets up to a tunnel
going through a large hill. Darkness takes over the shot.
I/E. PIMPÃO'S DODGE CHARGER / TUNNEL - LATE AFTERNOON
A blinding streak of light and shrill whistles cut into the
darkness. Veroca takes the viewfinder away from her eye.
Many cars are parked on the side of the road, trunks open,
dozens of people being searched. It's a checkpoint.
The couple on the motorcycle have pulled over. Pimpão shuts
off the radio, looking nervous.
PIMPÃO
Kill the joint, Reyna.
Reynaldo stubs out the joint and stuffs it into his jeans.
ARMED POLICE OFFICERS point their flashlights at the Dodge,
waving. Pimpão pulls over.
OFFICER 1
Cut the engine.
Veroca holds the camera up. A POLICE OFFICER points a gun at
her.
OFFICER 1 (CONT'D)
Put that camera down, dammit.
Everyone out. Hands on the wall.
Pimpão and Veroca get out with their hands up. Helena and
Reynaldo are yanked out and lined up against the wall.
5.
6.
The Officer shines his flashlight straight into Veroca's
eyes. She squints as he compares her to a list of photos of
YOUNG SUSPECTS, some with glasses, long hair, and beards.
OFFICER 1 (CONT'D)
(to Pimpão)
ID.
Pimpão takes a step toward the Dodge. Another Officer shoves
him, and he falls.
VEROCA
Hey, you can't do that--
OFFICER 2
-Shut your trap, kid.
PIMPÃO
It's in the car. Can I get it?
Pimpão pulls the ID out of the glove compartment and shows it
to the Officer, who turns the flashlight on him. Pimpão
stares into the light, cowed.
INT. PAIVA FAMILY HOME / LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Rubens is balancing on a chair to decorate the higher reaches
of the Christmas tree, with Eliana's help. Marcelo plays with
the puppy, nosing at the figurines in the Nativity scene.
Eunice, looking out the window, addresses Rubens.
EUNICE
How long was that movie supposed to
be, anyway?
RUBENS
She'll be home soon. Pimpão must've
dropped the others off first.
On the 16-inch TV playing in the background, the broadcast is
interrupted for a breaking news bulletin.
ANCHORMAN
...kidnapping in Rio de Janeiro...
RUBENS
(to Eliana)
Turn it up, would you?
Eliana runs over to the TV and turns up the volume. The
anchor reads a statement from the Armed Forces.
6.
7.
ANCHORMAN
...Giovanni Bucher's car was
intercepted en route to the embassy
this morning. Terrorists emerged
from multiple cars and captured the
diplomat after wounding his
bodyguard...
Rubens steps down from the chair and sits on the couch, next
to Eliana. Eunice walks over to the TV.
ELIANA
Didn't they let that guy go
already, Dad?
RUBENS
No, that was the German ambassador.
This one's Swiss, honey.
ANCHORMAN
...pamphlets were left at the scene
signed by the kidnappers, self-
proclaimed National Liberation
Alliance....
Eunice goes back to window. She notices a car outside,
driving off.
INT. PAIVA FAMILY HOME / KITCHEN - NIGHT
Eunice walks into the kitchen to find Veroca, on edge,
talking to Maria José while Nalu puts the dinner dishes away.
VEROCA
...I'm still shaking, look. It was
fucked up--
EUNICE
-Watch your language, Veroca. Where
on earth were you?
VEROCA
We got pulled over at a checkpoint
coming back from the drive-in. The
guys were going nuts, searching
everyone. It was awful.
EUNICE
Another ambassador's been
kidnapped. We just saw on TV.
7.
8.
VEROCA
Luckily, Pimpão had his dad's BBA
card.
NALU
What does BBA mean?
EUNICE
That's why it's good to have a
lawyer in the family.
MARIA JOSÉ
Sure wish I did.
EUNICE
(to Nalu)
Brazilian Bar Association.
(to Maria José)
Can you put the coffee on?
MARIA JOSÉ
Sure, Mrs. Paiva.
(to Veroca)
Want me to fix you dinner?
VEROCA
Thanks, Zezé, but I'm not hungry.
Behind Eunice, Nalu mouths to Veroca: “you're screwed!”
EUNICE
Go talk to your dad. He was
worried.
INT. PAIVA FAMILY HOME / LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Veroca tries to make it through the living room unnoticed.
Marcelo spots his sister going upstairs and runs up to her
with the new dog in his arms, grinning.
MARCELO
Look! Daddy named him Pimpão.
VEROCA
Don't tell him.
Rubens turns toward Veroca, and they exchange looks at a
distance. Marcelo runs over to the window.
MARCELO
Did he leave already? But I was
going for a ride in his dad's
Dodge. You promised.
8.
9.
RUBENS
Wallababy, I don't want you riding
in that playboy's car.
VEROCA
Funny, I thought playboys were the
type that drank whiskey and smoked
cigars all day.
Rubens laughs at the dig.
RUBENS
No, sweetie. That's who pays for
your matinées. What did you "not
see"?
VEROCA
Blow-Up. The sound was shitty.
RUBENS
You're going to give your mother a
heart attack if you keep on
disappearing like that.
VEROCA
Not my fault if the city's crawling
with pigs harassing everyone.
RUBENS
Look, while this ambassador thing's
still going on, I don't want you
going out at night.
VEROCA
What are you going to do, Mr.
Congressman? Lock me up at home?
Babiu comes in carrying the coffee tray, engrossed by the
task. Eunice follows. Veroca seizes the opportunity to
escape.
BABIU
Who wants coffee?
Eliana is still glued to the TV.
ELIANA
How many prisoners did they ask for
now, Dad?
Rubens looks over at Eunice, who's keenly awaiting his
answer.
9.
10.
RUBENS
I don't know.
EUNICE
Everyone to bed. Now.
ELIANA
I wanna finish watching the news.
EUNICE
No. Bedtime. And Marcelo, the dog goes
in the garage.
Eliana goes up in a huff. Babiu follows obediently.
EUNICE (CONT'D)
I'll call Dalva to see if Helena
got in all right. Sounds like it
wasn't pretty.
INT. PAIVA FAMILY HOME / CHILDREN'S ROOM - NIGHT
Marcelo is sleeping in his bunk bed, the dog beside him.
INT. PAIVA FAMILY HOME / MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
In his pajamas, Rubens brushes his teeth, leaning up against
the bathroom door, as Eunice vigorously brushes her hair in
front of her dressing table.
EUNICE
Dalva's still trying to get us to
go to London too. But then she
offered to take Veroca with them. I
think it might be a good idea.
RUBENS
(mouth full of toothpaste)
Do you?
EUNICE
Next year she'll start college. You
know how that goes.
RUBENS
Do I?
EUNICE
She'll get involved in student
politics, the way she is.
10.
11.
RUBENS
Let them settle down first. Then
we'll see. No rush.
EUNICE
Why are Gaspa and Dalva leaving all
of a sudden, then?
RUBENS
Gaspa's paranoid. Thinks he's being
watched.
EUNICE
Let's send her with them. At least
until this phase is over.
RUBENS
It'll pass soon. Remember the
macrobiotic phase? Lasted two
weeks.
EUNICE
Yeah, but no one gets arrested for
being macrobiotic.
The telephone rings. Rubens spits into the sink and hurries
over to pick it up on the nightstand.
RUBENS
(on the phone)
Hello? Speaking. Just a minute.
Rubens rests the phone on the nightstand.
RUBENS (CONT'D)
Work. I'll go pick it up in my
study. Hang up for me, will you?
EUNICE
What about Vera?
RUBENS
I'll talk to Gaspa. We'll figure
something out. Don't worry.
Eunice smiles, and Rubens goes out. She picks up a book from
the nightstand and opens it to a page marked by a black-and-
white photo of the couple in a carriage, surrounded by doves.
A few seconds later, she hangs up the receiver.
11.
12.
INT. PAIVA FAMILY HOME / STUDY - NIGHT
The door is ajar. Someone outside the study watches Rubens as
he puffs on a cigar and speaks in a low voice.
RUBENS
(on the phone)
...If I'm not here, you can leave
it at the office downtown. You have
the address, right?
A noise at the door catches Rubens' attention. He turns back
and covers the receiver with one hand.
RUBENS (CONT'D)
(on the phone)
We'll talk tomorrow.
He hangs up and goes over to the door. Marcelo is standing
there in his pajamas.
RUBENS (CONT'D)
Might I know what you're doing up
at this time of night?
MARCELO
I couldn't sleep and I smelled your
cigar. Who were you talking to?
RUBENS
Dad's on a secret mission. You know
what it is?
Marcelo shakes his head.
RUBENS (CONT'D)
To find out what are the odds of
you beating me at foosball.
The kid cracks a smile.
INT. PAIVA FAMILY HOME / LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Rubens and Marcelo play foosball. Rubens celebrates a goal,
Marcelo picks up the ball and puts it on the table. Father
and son, exhilarated, get back to their game.
EXT. PLOT OF LAND IN JARDIM BOTÂNICO - LATE AFTERNOON
Through the viewfinder of Veroca's Super 8, we see the Paivas
on the grounds of an old quarry, surrounded by dense forest.
They're visiting the site of their future home.
12.
13.
The footage is silent.
The family gathers around the scale model of the new house.
In Rubens' hands is the blueprint. He gesticulates, guiding
two LABORERS who put down markers across the plot.
Marcelo runs over to the edge of the area marked out by the
stakes and points at the statue of Christ the Redeemer up on
top of Corcovado and grins at the camera.
Babiu tries to go after her brother, but trips and falls on a
mound of sand. Eunice comes into the shot to pick her up.
At the other end of the plot, Eliana points to the lagoon,
off in the distance. Rubens takes the camera from Veroca and
films his daughter, who hides behind Nalu, smiling.
INT. DINER - NIGHT
The room is packed with FAMILIES and YOUNG COUPLES enjoying a
night out. At a large table, Eunice and the children share
fries and milkshakes.
ELIANA
You'll meet the next John Lennon
and never come back.
VEROCA
Of course I'm coming back. I want
to major in sociology here.
EUNICE
But you don't have to choose now.
Decide after the trip.
VEROCA
I've already made up my mind, Mom.
Rubens comes over with an ice cream cone, hands it to Eunice,
and sits down next to her.
RUBENS
Rum raisin for my Mediterranean.
MARCELO
What did you call Mom?
RUBENS
Mediterranean, Son. A mix of
Italian, Spanish, Greek, and
Turkish. Your mother, the most
beautiful woman in the world.
13.
14.
He kisses Eunice, oblivious to the children's wrangling. An
intimate moment in the midst of the hubbub.
EXT. GASPARIANS' BOOKSHOP - NIGHT
The OPEL KADETT is parked outside a small, charming
bookstore, which is closed. A light shining out from the
display window hints at life within.
INT. GASPARIANS' BOOKSHOP - NIGHT
Babiu and Marcelo run down the corridors of empty shelves.
Helena and her sister chat with Eliana and Veroca. Standing
by Eunice, DALVA GASPARIAN, 40, hands Nalu a book.
DALVA
This one's for you.
NALU
Thank you, Dalva.
EUNICE
Veroca promised not to give you any
trouble.
DALVA
She'll be no trouble at all.
NALU
I can always go in her place.
EUNICE
When the house gets off the ground,
we'll all go.
DALVA
Yeah, right, once you move into that
house, you'll never leave Rio again.
At the back of the store, FERNANDO GASPARIAN, 40, is sealing
up boxes of books. Rubens, crouched down beside him, is as
lighthearted as the rest.
RUBENS
I’m sending Veroca first to see if
it's not a scam.
GASPA
It's gotten too dangerous here,
Rubens. We are sitting ducks. You
should really come with us.
14.
15.
RUBENS
Offering shelter for a whole family in
London?
GASPA
You’re family, too.
RUBENS
You'll be back soon, reopen the
bookstore, the publishing house. It
won't be long. You'll see, Gaspa.
The friends exchange a moved look. In the backdrop, Dalva and
the kids say their goodbyes to the Paivas, heads hung low.
INT. PAIVA FAMILY HOME / GIRLS' BEDROOM - DAY
Veroca is packing. Nalu, in the bed beside her, pays close
attention as her sister rifles through a wooden box.
NALU
Are you taking that all?
Veroca picks a necklace.
VEROCA
Just this one.
She offers the box of costume jewelry to her sister.
NALU
Seriously?
VEROCA
Just don't let Eliana touch it.
Nalu crosses her fingers and kisses them, sealing the pact.
INT. PAIVA FAMILY HOME / MASTER BEDROOM - DAY
Eunice reaches for a hatbox on a high shelf in her closet.
She puts her hand into a wool cap and pulls out an envelope
with some foreign currency.
EUNICE
Don't spend it all on records. Buy
some boots. You need a good pair in
the cold.
VEROCA
Thank you. Do you still have that
brown coat?
15.
16.
EUNICE
Which one?
VEROCA
The fur-lined one.
Eunice picks out a worn suede coat lined with sheep's wool in
the armoire.
EUNICE
But it's so old. A gift from your
dad. Honeymoon in Bariloche.
VEROCA
Looks brand-new. Can I borrow it?
Eunice puts it on Veroca. She admires her daughter in the
dressing table mirror.
EUNICE
You'd better behave there. Dalva
has enough on her mind.
VEROCA
I can take care of myself, Mom.
EUNICE
All right. Take care of my coat,
then, I'll want it back.
VEROCA
I promise.
Victorious, Veroca gives her mother a kiss before leaving.
EUNICE
Don't run off right away. I'm going
to make a soufflé for you all.
EXT. PAIVA FAMILY HOME - EARLY AFTERNOON
Marcelo and his friends play soccer on the street outside.
GUESTS are trickling in through the open living room door,
dressed in bathing suits and casual clothes.
INT. PAIVA FAMILY HOME / LIVING ROOM - EARLY AFTERNOON
Je t'aime... Moi non plus, by Jane Birkin and Serge
Gainsbourg, spins on the turntable. Nalu and Cristina dance,
giggling. Babiu watches from the stairs, somewhat bemused.
16.
17.
BEATRIZ RYFF, 60s, e DALAL ACHCAR, 34, drinks in hand, chat
as they shimmy their shoulders to the music.
DALAL
Anyone interested in this house?
BEATRIZ
You, right?
DALAL
I'm looking for a place like this,
round here.
BEATRIZ
Rubens hasn't even started the new
house. But I can introduce you to a
great realtor.
DALAL
Please. Our townhouse can't handle the
new students.
Eunice comes back from the kitchen with ice for their drinks.
EUNICE
I don't know how Dalal manages to run
a school alone.
DALAL
I don't have five kids, right?
BEATRIZ
What a delicious smell. How do you
keep it from sticking to the pan?
EUNICE
You run a knife around the edge, put
it in a very hot oven and don't open
it.
DALAL
Look how sweet, the girls dancing. I'm
glad they don't understand French.
Eunice spots Nalu, who hurries to turn the record over. A
peppier pop song comes on.
NALU
I was just showing Cris.
EUNICE
Seen Veroca?
17.
18.
NALU
Isn’t she in the bedroom?
Eunice goes over to Babiu, who's wiggling her loose tooth.
EUNICE
Don't put that dirty hand in your
mouth.
BABIU
It's about to fall out.
EUNICE
Let it fall out on its own. Anybody
upstairs?
Babiu shakes her head. Eunice heads over to the study.
INT. PAIVA FAMILY HOME / STUDY - EARLY AFTERNOON
The room is swirling with smoke. Eliana, T-shirt over wet
bikini, is sitting on the arm of Rubens' armchair.
Around them, Boca, the journalists RAUL RYFF, 60, and FELIX,
30, and the lawyer LINO MACHADO, 50, smoke cigars, drink
whiskey and talk over one another.
RAUL
Brasília is a ticking time bomb.
The military will hit hard.
BOCA
Seventy prisoners for an ambassador
is unheard-of, they’re playing with
fire.
LINO
General Médici is going to be out
for blood, you can take that to the
bank.
RUBENS
How are things at the paper?
FELIX
Worse by the day.
ELIANA
If the military say no, will they
kill him?
The men look at each other, at a loss for words.
18.
19.
RUBENS
No, honey. I bet right now Mr.
Switzerland's playing cards and
smoking cigars.
Rubens' belly laugh is contagious.
ELIANA
How would you know, Dad?
Before he can answer, Eunice cuts in.
EUNICE
Soufflé's in the oven. Who's
hungry?
LINO
Don't need to tell me twice.
The men start into the living room.
EUNICE
Wet bikini on the couch, Eliana? Go
change.
ELIANA
It's too hot.
RUBENS
Go on, do as your mother says.
He strokes Eliana's hair, and she runs upstairs.
EUNICE
Have you seen Veroca?
RUBENS
I'll find her, don't worry.
INT. PAIVA FAMILY HOME / GARAGE - EARLY AFTERNOON
Hidden in the garage, Veroca, Pimpão and Reynaldo chat while
drinking whiskey straight from the bottle.
VEROCA
... a photo of me crossing Abbey
Road, just to make you jealous.
Veroca takes a swig just as Rubens opens the door.
RUBENS
How about some ice?
19.
20.
When she spots her father, she clumsily puts the bottle down
and knocks it over. Pimpão tries to wipe up the mess, looking
self-conscious.
PIMPÃO
We didn't mean to bother.
RUBENS
Lunch is almost ready.
VEROCA
We're just heading out to the
lagoon--
RUBENS
-This is your going-away party,
Vera. C'mon.
INT. PAIVA FAMILY HOME / LIVING ROOM - EARLY AFTERNOON
Eunice's soufflé is greeted enthusiastically by all. The
guests serve themselves and eat, scattered around the house.
INT. PAIVA FAMILY HOME / LIVING ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON
The puppy is napping next to one of the speakers. The record
on the turntable plays mellow British rock. Rubens' hand
lifts the needle, cutting the song off.
VEROCA
Hey! Isn't this my party? I get to
pick the music.
RUBENS
What happened to peace and love,
Vera? You'll get tired of this
gringo music.
Rubens picks out another record and puts it on. Take Me Back
to Piauí, by Juca Chaves starts up. The dog flees as the
music floods into the room.
The guests liven up. Babiu, dozing on Eunice's lap, wakes up
and joins Marcelo, who's dancing with Nalu, showing off.
Rubens goes over to Pimpão.
RUBENS (CONT'D)
Might I have the honor of a dance
with this young lady?
VEROCA
Why are you asking him?
20.
21.
RUBENS
Will you put me on your dance card?
VEROCA
No way.
Rubens pulls his daughter up as she rolls her eyes and
laughs. They start dancing. Eliana joins them.
Pimpão notices Eunice looking on with a smile on her lips and
invites her to dance. The two start whirling around the room.
Rubens, feeling a prick of jealousy, swaps partners. Eunice
murmurs in her husband's ear.
EUNICE
Can you believe our Vera's going
away?
RUBENS
Soon it'll be just you and me.
Rubens gives Eunice a passionate kiss. Babiu interrupts the
moment, showing off the tooth in her palm.
BABIU
My tooth fell out!
Everyone celebrates.
EXT. LEBLON BEACH - LATE AFTERNOON
The sun is setting behind the mountains, bathing the beach in
orange. The party has moved out onto the sand.
Marcelo and friends fly a kite. Rubens, at a distance from
the group, is helping Babiu bury her baby tooth.
BABIU
What if someone finds it?
RUBENS
Not a chance, sweetheart. Look at the
size of the beach.
BABIU
What if we don't find it?
RUBENS
Oh, we will. I counted the steps from
home to here.
21.
22.
They both pat the sand down over the spot where the tooth is
buried. From afar, Eunice, camera in hands, waves them over.
EUNICE
Come on, let's take a picture.
Babiu runs over to her mother. Rubens quickly digs up the
tooth and puts it in his pocket.
Eunice frames the guests in the viewfinder, their backs to
the sea. Lino comes up to her and puts out a hand.
LINO
Let me. You have to be in the photo.
Lino takes the camera. Rubens pulls Eunice to the middle of
the group photo, next to Veroca.
RUBENS
Nobody serious, okay? Attention.
"Ditch the Ditchtators"!
Everyone bursts out laughing. The photo is snapped, and the
group disperses.
Eunice is the only one to notice three ARMY TRUCKS rumbling
down the avenue in front of the family's house.
INT. PAIVA FAMILY HOME / LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON
Eliana is doing homework on the living room table while Maria
José and Babiu talk in the kitchen. The phone rings.
ELIANA
I'll take it, Zezé.
Eliana runs into the study to pick it up.
ELIANA (CONT'D)
(on the phone)
Hello? He's not at home. Who's this?
Hello?
The call cuts off. She puts the receiver down, suspicious.
INT. ENGINEERING FIRM / RUBENS' OFFICE - DAY
Leaning over his drafting table, Rubens squints as he revises
calculations. In front of him on the desk is a framed family
portrait. A COWORKER comes over.
22.
23.
COWORKER
Rubens, someone left this for you.
The man hands him a brown envelope.
RUBENS
Thanks.
Rubens' plump hands rip open the package. Inside are a few
letters with no return address. One is from Veroca,
accompanied by a roll of Super 8 film and a 7-inch record.
INT. PAIVA FAMILY HOME / LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Pimpão the dog, fatter after months with the family, observes
Eunice's well-manicured hands adjusting the Super 8 in the
projector. Nalu holds the turntable needle over the record.
NALU
Can I?
RUBENS
Hold your horses, Miss Mess, she
said we had to start it at the same
time as the movie.
Eunice keys up the film and signals to Babiu, who turns out
the lights and scampers over to the sofa with her siblings.
Nalu lets the needle drop. Eunice flips the projector on.
Rubens, standing next to a screen on a tripod, waits to read
the letter in his hand. A grainy image of Veroca appears,
wearing Eunice's coat. Everyone's eyes shine with delight.
RUBENS (CONT'D)
(reading letter)
Guys, this is no ordinary letter.
It's a sensory experience, like a
Mutantes concert.
Eunice ably adjusts the focus. Rubens waits for the next
scene. The Gasparians' house in London appears onscreen.
RUBENS (CONT'D)
(reading letter)
Look at our house, straight out of
Blow Up. All of the other ones on
the street are exactly the same.
It's really funny.
The footage now shows Gaspa, Dalva, and their children in a
snowy park. The kids are building a diminutive snowman.
23.
24.
RUBENS (CONT'D)
(reading letter)
It's a little weird to spend
Christmas without the beach, but
snow is pretty cool, too. We even
got to make our first snowman.
Veroca runs over to the snowman and puts a leaf under the
nose to make a mustache and a twig in its mouth for a cigar.
RUBENS (CONT'D)
(reading letter)
Remind you of someone?
Rubens lets out his belly laugh. On the screen, Veroca and
Helena emulate the cover of Abbey Road.
RUBENS (CONT'D)
(reading letter)
And how about this street? It was
so exciting. Can you believe my
feet touched the same ground as
John Lennon, Nalu? Hard to believe
the Beatles ever recorded here...
Now Veroca enters a record store, camera in hand. She focuses
in on the T.Rex single that came with the letter.
RUBENS (CONT'D)
(reading letter)
Look at this musical wonderland. I
could camp out in here. I only
bought one single, and it's for...
(skips a beat, irritated)
...for Pimpão, who's going to get a
kick out of this glam rock stuff.
Hearing his name, the mutt looks quizzically over at Rubens.
The film ends with Veroca and Helena on Portobello Road.
RUBENS (CONT'D)
(reading letter)
I hope you're all well. Love,
kisses, miss you all, Vera Lennon.
The projector lights up the screen, illuminating the Paivas'
smiling faces. Marcelo gets up, excited.
MARCELO
Put it on again, Mom!
Eunice rewinds the roll. Nalu hurries to start the song over.
24.
25.
ELIANA
Can I read this time, Dad?
RUBENS
Sure.
Rubens hands her the letter, sits on the couch and lights a
cigar. Tendrils of smoke pirouette up into the beam of light,
casting curlicues onto the screen as the film starts over.
ELIANA
(reading letter)
Guys, this is no ordinary letter.
It's a sensory experience...
Eunice goes over to Rubens and strokes his head.
RUBENS
Sit with me.
The children make room, and Eunice sits down next to Rubens.
The family watches the movie again, enraptured. After a few
seconds, the doorbell cuts into the happy moment.
EUNICE
Expecting someone?
RUBENS
Just a sec.
Rubens goes off. Eunice tries to concentrate on the film, but
can't. She turns to see her husband handing the package he
received at the office to someone she can't see.
INT. PAIVA FAMILY HOME / MASTER BEDROOM - MORNING
A ray of sunlight makes its way onto Eunice's sleepy face.
She turns over drowsily and notices that Rubens' side of the
bed is empty.
She walks decidedly over to the window, and opens the blinds.
Light rushes into the room, bathing it with gold, and Eunice
smiles at the sight of the sea shining in the distance.
INT. PAIVA FAMILY HOME / STUDY - DAY
The dog noses at the model of the house on the desk. Eunice
puts the Super 8 roll away in a box filled with photographs.
25.
26.
EUNICE
If I don't organize these photos
once and for all, I'm going to get
hopelessly mixed up.
She shoos Pimpão away, and her eye is caught by the model.
EUNICE (CONT'D)
Can’t we put air conditioning in
the kids' room?
Rubens, in shorts and a linen shirt in his armchair, is
staring intently at the pieces on a backgammon board.
RUBENS
The house will be breezy. There's a
cobogó wall, a big veranda.
He makes his move. Eunice joins Rubens and lights a
cigarette. The phone rings. She stays put, eyes on the board.
RUBENS (CONT'D)
Pick it up, honey.
EUNICE
I'm playing.
She rolls the dice. He gets up to answer the phone.
RUBENS
(on the phone)
Hello? That's right, at the corner
of Almirante Guimarães. We'll be
here all afternoon. Thanks.
Eunice finishes her move. Rubens sits down and rolls.
RUBENS (CONT'D)
Is there a good movie at the Pax?
EUNICE
We have dinner at Dalal's. Boca
didn't say?
RUBENS
We can go to the movies afterward.
Rubens finishes his move and picks up the culture section of
the newspaper.
Eunice rolls the dice and pulls the last pieces off the
board, victorious. She gets up, and Rubens playfully pulls
her onto his lap.
26.
27.
RUBENS (CONT'D)
Where are you going?
EUNICE
To start the soufflé.
He gives her a kiss as the door opens and Maria José comes
in, trying to stay calm.
MARIA JOSÉ
There's someone to see you, sir--
DR. SCHNEIDER, short, in a sweat-spotted shirt, marches into
the room. Behind him are SIX MEN in plainclothes with
revolvers and submachine guns. Eunice springs up, petrified.
RUBENS
What's going on?
DR. SCHNEIDER
Congressman Rubens Paiva?
RUBENS
I think there's been some mistake.
I haven't been in Congress for
years now.
DR. SCHNEIDER
No mistake, sir, you'll be coming
with us.
EUNICE
Where are you going to take my
husband?
DR. SCHNEIDER
To give a deposition. It's routine.
EUNICE
A deposition about what, Rubens?
RUBENS
(to Eunice)
It's all right, don't worry.
(to Schneider)
I just need to change.
DR. SCHNEIDER
(to two Men)
Escort Mr. Paiva.
Two Men follow Rubens out of the study.
27.
28.
DR. SCHNEIDER (CONT'D)
Anyone else at home?
EUNICE
Just my children. They're upstairs.
There's no need for weapons.
Schneider gestures to the Men, who hide their guns under
their shirts.
INT. PAIVA FAMILY HOME / LIVING ROOM - DAY
Eunice and Maria José walk in, trailed by Schneider. Men pull
the curtains shut and mutter into two-way radios.
Nalu comes in from the beach with Cristina, their hair wet.
They are oblivious to the Men moving around the house.
NALU
Hi, Mom. Where's Daddy?
EUNICE
Hi, dear. He's in the bedroom.
Nalu runs up the stairs. Cristina stays in the living room.
INT. PAIVA FAMILY HOME / MASTER BEDROOM - DAY
Nalu doesn't blink at finding two strangers with her father,
who's putting on a tie and struggles to act naturally.
NALU
Can I borrow a shirt, Dad?
RUBENS
Sure, Miss Mess. But give me a kiss
first.
She gives him a peck and adjusts his tie.
NALU
Where are you going all dressed up?
RUBENS
Up to the office for a bit.
NALU
But it's a holiday.
28.
29.
RUBENS
I'm just going to help these
gentlemen. I'll be back soon,
sweetie.
Rubens hands her a shirt with R.P. monogrammed on the pocket.
INT. PAIVA FAMILY HOME / LIVING ROOM - DAY
Nalu runs down the stairs wearing her father's shirt. Rubens
comes after her, followed by the Men.
RUBENS
Tell Sebastião not to be a
stranger, Cristina.
CRISTINA
I will, Uncle Rubens.
EUNICE
I changed my mind, honey. Sleep at
Cris's house and tomorrow you can
go to ballet together, all right?
The girls hurry out, elated. Rubens picks up the car keys.
EUNICE (CONT'D)
(to Schneider)
Can I go with him?
DR. SCHNEIDER
Your husband will be home soon.
RUBENS
I'll be back in time for the
soufflé.
He gives his wife a kiss and leaves. She goes out after him.
Schneider follows her.
EXT. PAIVA FAMILY HOME - DAY
On the porch, Eunice picks up Pimpão as he tries to follow
Rubens. Two Men get into the backseat of Ruben's OPEL KADETT
as he takes the wheel.
EUNICE
Where's the deposition?
DR. SCHNEIDER
I'm not privy to that information.
29.
30.
The Opel Kadett sets off, tailed by another unmarked car.
Eunice looks over at Schneider, who's standing by her side.
EUNICE
And what about you all?
DR. SCHNEIDER
We'll keep you company, ma'am.
She walks back in, followed by Schneider. The door swings
shut.
INT. PAIVA FAMILY HOME / LIVING ROOM - DAY
Marcelo, drowsy and in his pajamas, comes down the stairs.
EUNICE
Morning, honey. Did you sleep well?
MARCELO
Who are these guys?
EUNICE
They're from pest control. C'mon,
let's get you something to eat.
Marcelo joins Babiu in the kitchen, who's eating breakfast
with Maria José.
MARCELO
Is Dad at the beach?
MARIA JOSÉ
He went out for a bit.
Maria José whispers to Eunice.
MARIA JOSÉ (CONT'D)
I'm a bundle of nerves, Mrs. Paiva,
my hand won't stop shaking.
Eunice takes the maid's hand in hers and looks into her eyes.
EUNICE
Stay calm. You take care of the
kids, and I'll deal with these men.
The telephone rings. Eunice turns back to the door and finds
herself face to face with Schneider.
DR. SCHNEIDER
Where's the extension?
30.
31.
EUNICE
One in the office and another
upstairs.
Schneider signals for one of the Men to go upstairs, and for
another one to go into the study. The phone rings again.
Before Eunice picks it up, Schneider looks straight at her.
DR. SCHNEIDER
If it's for your husband, he's out
of town.
Eunice nods and brings the receiver up to her ear.
EUNICE
(on the phone)
Hello? Hi, Dalal. Yeah, but today
won't work. Rubens had to travel
last minute.
She stammers, hesitant.
EUNICE (CONT'D)
(on the phone)
Nothing serious. It's a family
matter, he'll be back tomorrow.
Eunice looks over at Schneider, who stares back soberly.
EUNICE (CONT'D)
Okay. I will. Give Boca my best.
She hangs up, tense, and tries to lighten the mood.
EUNICE (CONT'D)
We haven't been introduced yet. I'm
Eunice.
DR. SCHNEIDER
Schneider.
EUNICE
Have you gentlemen had lunch?
DR. SCHNEIDER
Oh, we wouldn't want to bother,
ma'am.
EUNICE
I insist.
(to Maria José)
Get the chicken out of the freezer.
We'll make a fricassee.
31.
32.
INT. PAIVA FAMILY HOME / LIVING ROOM - LATER.
At the table, Marcelo and Babiu are eating with Zezé. Eunice
smokes and bounces her leg, studying Schneider and his Men on
the couch, plates on their laps, watching TV.
POLICE CHIEF (O.S.)
...this wave of car thefts that's
taking over the city...
EUNICE
What is it that you do, exactly,
Dr. Schneider?
DR. SCHNEIDER
(chewing)
I'm a parapsychologist.
EUNICE
A parapsychologist?
Eliana comes in, baseball cap and T-shirt over her damp
bikini. Eunice notes the Men's eyes following her.
ELIANA
Why's the house all closed up?
EUNICE
Come have lunch, sweetie.
Eliana runs over to the kitchen and comes back with her
volleyball.
ELIANA
I'll eat after practice.
As she's midway to the front door, Schneider calls out.
DR. SCHNEIDER
Can't go out now.
She keeps on heading for the door, but one of Schneider's Men
blocks the way.
ELIANA
Move.
DR. SCHNEIDER
No one leaves til your dad comes
back.
ELIANA
Where did Dad go?
32.
33.
Eunice hastens over to her daughter, placing herself between
Eliana and the Man.
EUNICE
He went out. Let's go to your room.
ELIANA
But Mom, they're waiting for me at
the net.
EUNICE
You can play later. Now come on,
let's get you into some dry
clothes.
Eliana notices her mother's strained tone. She lets the ball
drop and heads upstairs with her, under Schneider's watchful
gaze.
INT. PAIVA FAMILY HOME / GIRLS' BEDROOM - DAY
Eunice shuts the door, which is plastered with Beatles
posters. On the nightstand between two twin beds, a portable
record player and a sticker album from the 1970 World Cup.
ELIANA
Who are these guys? Why can't I go
out?
EUNICE
Shhh. They took your father.
ELIANA
Where to?
EUNICE
I don't know. They said he had to
answer a few questions.
ELIANA
Are they policemen?
EUNICE
I think they're from the army.
Eliana knows what this means, and can't hide the fear that
overcomes her.
EUNICE (CONT'D)
Calm down, honey. It'll be okay.
Just don't tell the little ones.
They don't know what's going on.
33.
34.
INT. PAIVA FAMILY HOME / LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Eliana bounces her leg and watches Marcelo playing foosball
with one of the Men. Schneider talks into his radio. She
notices the bulk of his gun under his shirt.
Eunice comes down the stairs.
EUNICE
That's enough, Marcelo, come to
bed.
MARCELO
In a minute.
EUNICE
No, Maria José just finished
putting Babiu down.
MARCELO
(to the Man)
We can finish tomorrow.
EUNICE
These gentlemen won't be here
tomorrow.
The Men exchange glances, in silence.
MARCELO
(to the Man)
All right, then, you win.
Marcelo goes upstairs, pouting.
EUNICE
Is there anything else I can do for
you gentlemen? There's food in the
fridge, if you're hungry.
DR. SCHNEIDER
We'll get by all right, thank you.
EUNICE
Could you call in and check when
Rubens will be back? It's getting
late and I'm worried.
DR. SCHNEIDER
Can't do that. Unfortunately.
Eunice realizes she's not going to get anywhere with him.
34.
35.
EUNICE
C'mon, sweetie, let's go up to bed.
The Men settle down on the couch and around the living room
floor. Eliana goes up the stairs with her mother, whispering.
ELIANA
They're armed, Mom.
EUNICE
I know.
ELIANA
Can I sleep in your bed?
EUNICE
Best stay with your sisters.
INT. PAIVA FAMILY HOME / CHILDREN'S ROOM - LATE AT NIGHT
From her bed, Eliana looks over at Marcelo and Babiu sleeping
in their bunk bed. She rolls over, but can't get to sleep.
INT. PAIVA FAMILY HOME / MASTER BEDROOM - LATE AT NIGHT
Eunice smokes a cigarette as she leans on the windowsill,
staring out at the dark beach and the still, silent sea.
A car pulls up and parks in front of the house. She stubs the
cigarette into an overflowing ashtray and hurries off.
INT. PAIVA FAMILY HOME / LIVING ROOM - LATE AT NIGHT
Eunice rushes down the stairs and finds a new GROUP OF MEN
coming into the living room.
DR. SCHNEIDER
Just a shift change, Mrs. Paiva,
you can go back to bed.
EUNICE
I'm not tired.
Eunice heads up to the study. The Men watch her go.
35.
36.
INT. PAIVA FAMILY HOME / STUDY - LATE AT NIGHT
Trying not to make any noise, Eunice rummages through the
desk drawers in search of any potentially suspicious
material. All she finds is an address book, papers from
Rubens' work, a few sketches and handwritten notes.
She picks up some scattered photos and puts them into a box
with the rest. Through a crack in the door, she sneaks a
glance at the Men dozing in the living room. Then she notices
that one of them is staring back at her from the couch.
INT. PAIVA FAMILY HOME / GIRLS' BEDROOM - DAY
Eliana is sleeping, curled up in her bed.
EUNICE (O.S.)
Eliana. Wake up, sweetie.
Eliana opens her eyes and sees her mother.
ELIANA
Is Dad back?
EUNICE
Not yet. They want to ask us some
questions.
ELIANA
Me too?
EUNICE
Yes, sweetie. But don't worry,
we'll be back soon.
Frightened, Eliana sits up and rubs her eyes. Eunice goes to
the chest of drawers.
EUNICE (CONT'D)
C'mon, get dressed.
She hands her daughter a change of clothes and hurries out.
Eliana notices Babiu in her bunk bed, eyes wide open.
EXT. PAIVA FAMILY HOME - MORNING
Eliana and Eunice, purse in hand, are escorted by Schneider
and his Men. On her way out, she speaks to Maria José.
EUNICE
Stay with the children, please.
36.
37.
They are guided into the backseat of a POLICE CAR next to a
CREAM-COLORED VW BEETLE. The cars take off. Maria José looks
on uneasily from the porch, flanked by Schneider.
I/E. POLICE CAR - MORNING
The POLICE CAR speeds down the busy streets, siren wailing.
In the backseat, Eunice holds her daughter's hand.
The cars pull over abruptly. One of Schneider's Men reaches
for something in the glove compartment and then holds out two
black hoods.
SCHNEIDER'S MAN
Put this on, please.
EUNICE
There's no need for that.
SCHNEIDER'S MAN
It's protocol, ma'am.
Eunice takes the hoods and holds one out to Eliana. She nods
and covers her own head. Eliana does the same.
In the darkness, we hear the car taking off again. The roar
of the engine bleeds into all of the other city sounds, in a
stifling, crescendoing cacophony.
INT. MILITARY DETENTION CENTER / INTERROGATION ROOM - UNKNOWN
The hood is pulled off. Eunice is sitting in front of a table
under a bare lightbulb. There are two MILITARY OFFICERS with
her, one of them in the shadows at the back of the room.
EUNICE
Where is my daughter?
MILITARY OFFICER 1
Eliana's outside. Sorry about the
hood, Mrs. Paiva. Cigarette?
The Officer offers her a pack of cigarettes. Eunice shakes
her head no. She notices a piece of fabric covering the place
where the officer's name is sewn onto his uniform.
EUNICE
Where is my husband?
He lights a cigarette, takes a drag, and flips through a
folder of documents on the table.
37.
38.
MILITARY OFFICER 1
How long have you been married?
EUNICE
I want to see him.
MILITARY OFFICER 1
Here it says eighteen years. Was he
associating with communists back
then?
EUNICE
My husband was in the Labor Party,
and I'd like to call my lawyer.
MILITARY OFFICER 1
No need. These are just routine
questions.
EUNICE
I'll answer them after I see my
daughter and my husband.
The Military Officer takes another drag and exhales slowly.
MILITARY OFFICER 1
He's upstairs. He's already told us
everything he knows. You just need
to confirm.
EUNICE
Confirm what?
MILITARY OFFICER 1
That he left the country in '64 for
conspiring against the revolution.
EUNICE
Rubens was a congressman. He was
ousted and had to go into exile.
But since he came back, he hasn't
been involved in politics.
MILITARY OFFICER 1
So why is he still fraternizing
with terrorists?
EUNICE
He never--
A desperate cry is heard outside the room.
38.
39.
INT. MILITARY DETENTION CENTER / HALLWAY - UNKNOWN
A PRISONER struggles as he is dragged along by SOLDIERS. They
go by Eliana, sitting on a bench, face covered and arms
cuffed behind her.
PRISONER
(muffled under a hood)
You can't do this, you bastards--
The Prisoner is punched in the stomach and starts coughing.
He's pulled into a room at the end of the hallway. A metal
door slams shut. Under her hood, Eliana sobs in terror.
INT. MILITARY DETENTION CENTER / INTERROGATION ROOM - UNKNOWN
Eunice stays stock-still until the coughing fades away. The
Military Officer continues his questioning, unfazed.
MILITARY OFFICER 1
How does your husband keep in touch
with the terrorists?
EUNICE
I'll take that cigarette now.
He holds out the pack again, she takes one, and he lights it.
EUNICE (CONT'D)
Rubens is an engineer, a husband
and father. He's got nothing to do
with terrorists.
MILITARY OFFICER 1
We've been keeping an eye on the
comings and goings at your house
for a while now, Mrs. Paiva.
EUNICE
We like having friends over.
The Military Officer who's been in the shadows comes up and
puts an album down on the table. The Interrogator opens it
up. The pages are full of black-and-white ID pictures.
MILITARY OFFICER 1
And are any of those friends here?
Eunice quickly casts her eyes over the page.
EUNICE
No.
39.
40.
The Officer draws closer and looks into her eyes.
MILITARY OFFICER 1
Mrs. Paiva, all I'm trying to do is
make sure you can keep taking care
of your home, driving your kids to
school and playing your backgammon.
That's my job.
The Military Officer drops his cigarette and stamps on the
butt. Eunice notices, under his polished combat boot, a dried
bloodstain on the concrete floor.
MILITARY OFFICER 1 (CONT'D)
How's Vera doing in London?
EUNICE
Did you do something to my
daughter?
MILITARY OFFICER 1
Did she do anything wrong?
EUNICE
Of course not. What sort of a
question is that?
MILITARY OFFICER 1
Well, then there's nothing to worry
about. Shall we try again?
He points to Rubens' picture in the album.
MILITARY OFFICER 1 (CONT'D)
Who is this man?
EUNICE
Rubens.
MILITARY OFFICER 1
See, it's not that hard. Who else
do you recognize?
Eunice's eyes flit anxiously across the page.
MILITARY OFFICER 1 (CONT'D)
Look carefully.
She points to a picture of MARTHA, 55.
EUNICE
That's Martha, my daughters'
teacher. What is she doing here?
40.
41.
MILITARY OFFICER 1
Her son provides logistics for the
subversives in Chile.
EUNICE
What does Rubens have to do with
any of this?
He stares at Eunice for a moment before answering.
MILITARY OFFICER 1
Martha was intercepted at the
airport yesterday, bringing letters
for your husband. I want to know
how he delivers them to the
terrorists.
EUNICE
I told you, Rubens has nothing to
do with terrorists.
MILITARY OFFICER 1
Ma'am, you'd better start
rethinking your attitude.
A knock on the door. The Officer in the shadows opens it. A
SOLDIER, 20, head shaved, salutes him and heads to Eunice.
EUNICE
Will I see my daughter now?
The hood goes over her head again, muffling her voice.
EUNICE (CONT'D)
But you said that If I answered--
MILITARY OFFICER 1
-We're not done yet.
The Soldier handcuffs Eunice.
EUNICE
Why the handcuffs?
MILITARY OFFICER 1
It's protocol.
INT. MILITARY DETENTION CENTER / HALLWAY - UNKNOWN
The Officers watch the Soldier take Eunice out of the room.
EUNICE
Where are you taking me?
41.
42.
ELIANA
Mom?
Eliana, handcuffed, struggles to get up.
EUNICE
Honey, are you all right?
ELIANA
Where are we? What's happening?
The Soldier gives Eliana a shove, and she falls back onto the
bench.
SOLDIER
Sit down, kid.
EUNICE
They're just going to ask you some
questions, sweetie. We're going
home soon.
Eunice is taken away by the Soldier.
EUNICE (CONT'D)
Let me stay with my daughter.
Eunice vanishes down the dark hallway. Eliana is breathing
shallowly under her hood when Officer 1 calls her in.
MILITARY OFFICER 1
Your turn, Eliana.
INT. MILITARY DETENTION CENTER / CELL - UNKNOWN
Eunice's hood is pulled off. The windowless cell has a thin,
stained mattress on the floor next to a urinal.
EUNICE
Have you seen my husband? They said
he was upstairs. He's in a shirt
and tie. He's got a mustache.
The Soldier takes her handcuffs off and leaves the cell.
EUNICE (CONT'D)
His name is Rubens. Please, help
me. I need to see him. Please.
The Soldier slides the barred door shut, locks it and starts
walking away. Eunice presses her body to the bars.
42.
43.
EUNICE (CONT'D)
Rubens!
The Soldier comes back to the cell and speaks in a low voice.
SOLDIER
Quiet. You'll just rile 'em up.
Eunice absorbs this and changes her tone.
EUNICE
Please don't let them do anything
to my daughter. She's just a child.
The Soldier looks into her eyes before walking away again.
Eunice paces up and down, distraught, until screams come from
afar. She sits down on the floor and notices the names,
dates, and drawings etched on the wall by previous prisoners.
INT. MILITARY DETENTION CENTER / CELL - UNKNOWN
Eunice is asleep on the mattress. A FIGURE comes up to the
door and shines a flashlight on her stricken face.
FIGURE
Name?
EUNICE
How long have I been here?
FIGURE
Say your name.
EUNICE
Eunice Paiva.
FIGURE
Full name.
EUNICE
Maria Lucrécia Eunice Facciola
Paiva. Where's my daughter?
The flashlight goes out and the Figure retreats. Eunice hears
his voice pose the same question to the next prisoner.
FIGURE (O.S.)
Name?
In the next cell over, an OLD MAN answers in a tired whisper.
43.
44.
INT. MILITARY DETENTION CENTER / INTERROGATION ROOM - UNKNOWN
Eunice, haggard, her clothes dirty, is once again sitting in
front of the photo album. A new OFFICER is interrogating her.
EUNICE
Do you have a cigarette--
MILITARY OFFICER 3
-Look again.
EUNICE
Please, I've told you everything I
know. I need a change of clothes,
couldn't I just--
The Officer turns the page. Eunice runs her tired eyes over
it and spots, next to Rubens, a photo of Eliana.
EUNICE (CONT'D)
My daughter, Eliana. Where is she?
MILITARY OFFICER 3
I'm not privy to that information.
Who else do you recognize?
Eunice looks back at the page. Among the rows of frighten
faces, she recognizes her own, on the day she arrived.
INT. MILITARY DETENTION CENTER / HALLWAY - UNKNOWN
Handcuffed and hooded, Eunice is led by the Soldier with the
shaved head. They walk by a room with the door ajar.
Inside, a FEMALE PRISONER tied to an inclined board has her
face covered with a towel. TORTURERS pour water on the cloth.
She coughs, choking.
PRISONER
(stifled by the towel)
For God's sake, you're killing me.
Eunice wrenches free and backs toward the door.
EUNICE
Eliana?
The Soldier goes over to Eunice.
SOLDIER
She's not here anymore.
44.
45.
Eunice lets the Soldier lead her. The screams slowly fade
away as they walk on ahead.
INT. MILITARY DETENTION CENTER / CELL - UNKNOWN
Inside the cell, the Soldier removes the cuffs and hood.
SOLDIER
Your daughter only stayed one
night.
EUNICE
How long have I been here?
SOLDIER
Three days.
EUNICE
What about my husband?
SOLDIER
Don't know about him.
He steps out and locks the door. Eunice sits down on the mat
and finds a blank patch of wall. With a fingernail, she
scratches out three lines.
INT. MILITARY DETENTION CENTER / HALLWAY - UNKNOWN
SOLDIERS wash the bloodstains from the hallway floor.
INT. MILITARY DETENTION CENTER / CELL - UNKNOWN
Eunice is lying down, completely still, when the weary voice
of the Old Man in the next cell starts to rasp out a samba.
OLD MAN (O.S.)
Samba, black, strong, and bold,
Hounded like hell wherever you go,
On the corner, in the bar, at
worship...
The singing is interrupted by a low thud.
SOLDIER (O.S.)
Shut up!
Terrified, Eunice curls up. On the wall next to her, seven
scratches indicate how long she's been imprisoned. In the
distance, rain starts to drum on the metal roof.
45.
46.
INT. MILITARY DETENTION CENTER / CELL - UNKNOWN
In the dark, Eunice sleeps next to an untouched tray of food.
A FIGURE wakes her up once again with a flashlight.
FIGURE
Name?
EUNICE
Maria Lucrécia Eunice Facciola
Paiva.
The flashlight goes out. Eunice is shrouded in darkness.
INT. MILITARY DETENTION CENTER / CELL - UNKNOWN
Looking much thinner and worn down, Eunice is squatting by
the urinal, washing her armpits with dirty water. On the wall
beside her are twelve scratches.
The Soldier with the shaved head unlocks the cell. Used to
the protocol by now, Eunice goes over to the door and puts
her hands through the bars, waiting to be cuffed.
SOLDIER
No cuffs today.
She finds this strange. He slides the door open.
EUNICE
Where are you taking me?
SOLDIER
I want you to know that I don't
think it's right.
EXT. MILITARY DETENTION CENTER / COURTYARD - NIGHT
The doors of the detention center open, revealing Eunice's
fragile figure, clutching her purse to her.
She walks across the courtyard with an unsteady, silent step,
until she spots Rubens's OPEL KADETT. She takes a step toward
it, but notices a SOLDIER watching her from a guard booth.
Shaken, Eunice gives up and quickens her pace, hastening over
to the iron gates that lead out onto the darkened street.
46.
47.
INT. PAIVA FAMILY HOME / LIVING ROOM - NIGHT56 56
Eunice gingerly opens the door and tries to cross the living
room quietly. She trips over Babiu's doll and freezes. Maria
José appears in the kitchen door, cigarette in hand.
MARIA JOSÉ
Mrs. Paiva?
Unused to smoking in front of her employer, Maria José casts
around for someplace to stub out her cigarette.
MARIA JOSÉ (CONT'D)
I'm sorry, it's just that
everyone's already asleep--
EUNICE
-Can I get one?
The maid comes over and holds out her pack of cigarettes.
Eunice takes one and steps back.
EUNICE (CONT'D)
I'm in dire need of a shower.
Maria José watches Eunice lighting the cigarette, her hands
shaking ever so slightly.
EUNICE (CONT'D)
Is Eliana here?
MARIA JOSÉ
Yes. She said you were coming back
with Rubens.
Eunice takes another drag, silent.
EUNICE
How is she?
MARIA JOSÉ
She's never at home anymore. Always
out playing volleyball.
EUNICE
And the little ones?
MARIA JOSÉ
Shaken up.
EUNICE
What about Vera? Have you heard
from her?
47.
48.
Maria José looks away, seeming uncomfortable.
MARIA JOSÉ
She called the other day... I told
her you'd gone to São Paulo.
EUNICE
You did the right thing. I'm so
sorry about all this. Were those
men here for very long?
MARIA JOSÉ
No, they left right after they took
you all. And how are you?
EUNICE
I can't even begin to thank you.
Call a cab and go get some rest.
Eunice pulls a few bills out of her purse and hands them
over. She starts going up the stairs, bone-tired.
MARIA JOSÉ
Nalu's in your bed. Since you've
been gone, she only sleeps there.
INT. PAIVA FAMILY HOME / CHILDREN'S ROOM - NIGHT
Eunice peeks into the dimly lit room. Eliana is sleeping in
her bed. In the bunk bed, deep in sleep, Babiu and Marcelo
share the bed with the dog.
Pimpão gets up and comes over, wagging his tail.
INT. PAIVA FAMILY HOME / MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
Eunice sees Nalu curled up in the big bed. She walks quietly
across the room, goes into the bathroom, and closes the door.
INT. PAIVA FAMILY HOME / MASTER BEDROOM / BATHROOM - NIGHT
Eunice flips on the light and sees her reflection in the
mirror above the sink. The dark circles under her eyes, her
lank hair, her dull skin.
She undresses, revealing her fragile frame, and turns on the
shower. Eunice scrubs her body until she's covered with foam.
She steps under the water, which reveals her reddened skin.
She reaches for the sponge and is obsessively scrubbing under
her nails when the bathroom door opens.
48.
49.
It's Nalu, who jumps when she sees her mother's thin,
reddened body. She starts sobbing.
EUNICE
Sweetie. C'mere.
Eunice wraps herself in a towel and dries the tears running
down her daughter's face.
EUNICE (CONT'D)
I just need to take a shower.
NALU
What's going on?
EUNICE
Everything's going to be all right,
honey.
Nalu wipes her nose, holding back her tears.
NALU
There's leftovers from lunch. Want
something to eat?
EUNICE
Go to your bed, and we'll have
breakfast together in the morning,
ok?
INT. PAIVA FAMILY HOME / CHILDREN'S ROOM - NIGHT
Nalu nudges Eliana. She whispers, trying not to wake their
siblings in the bunk bed.
NALU
Mom's back.
Eliana startles, suddenly awake.
ELIANA
What about Dad?
Nalu shakes her head. Eliana sits up.
NALU
She said nobody should go in. Can I
sleep with you?
Eliana makes room for her sister, who lies down beside her.
49.
50.
INT. PAIVA FAMILY HOME / MASTER BEDROOM - MORNING
The morning light falls on Eunice's sleeping, thin form. She
turns over in bed and opens her eyes. Eliana is sitting next
to her, watching over her. Her daughter chokes back tears.
ELIANA
I wanted to wait for you. But they
didn't let me. I’m sorry.
EUNICE
Don't cry, honey.
Eunice dries Eliana's tears.
EUNICE (CONT'D)
Did they do anything to you?
ELIANA
They asked lots of questions, but I
said I didn't know anything.
EUNICE
Did you see your father there?
Eliana looks down and shakes her head.
ELIANA
The papers say he escaped. But Lino
said it's a lie.
EUNICE
Lino was here?
ELIANA
No, everyone's over at Boca's. I go
there every day after school, we
were trying to find you.
Eunice struggles to digest this. Eliana comes closer and
lowers her voice.
ELIANA (CONT'D)
I told Zezé I was going to
volleyball practice so nobody would
get worried.
Eunice reaches for the phone on the nightstand.
ELIANA (CONT'D)
Mom, no. They said not to use the
phone. C'mon, I'll go with you.
50.
51.
EUNICE
No, Eliana. You have to go to
school.
Eunice checks the clock on the nightstand.
ELIANA
But I want to know what's
happening, why Dad still hasn't--
EUNICE
-Go get ready for school, honey.
ELIANA
But I'm helping them.
EUNICE
Your mom is taking care of this
now.
Marcelo and Babiu, in their school uniforms, burst into the
room and run over to her.
KIDS
Mom! Mommy!
They wrap her in a tight hug. Eunice strokes their heads.
EUNICE
My babies.
MARCELO
Where's Dad?
Eunice looks at her children, unable to answer.
INT. BOCA'S APARTMENT - DAY
Eunice, stricken, is holding a newspaper. The front page
shows a burned-out VW Beetle under the headline: "TERRORISTS
RESCUE PRISONER."
Around her are Boca, Raul, Felix, Lino, and Beatriz. They're
on edge and speaking over one another. Through the windows,
the light from the beach filters in.
FELIX
This rescue story is fabricated.
LINO
At least now it'll be harder for
them to deny that he really was
arrested.
51.
52.
EUNICE
They denied his arrest?
LINO
Said it had nothing to do with the
Army.
BEATRIZ
Same thing happened to the Pasquim
guys, and they're fine.
FELIX
Exactly. Vanished for two months,
then released.
RAUL
The international community is
watching closely.
Dalal comes in with a tray of glasses and ice, and joins the
conversation as she serves everyone.
DALAL
What about a photo? Of the family
without the father?
BOCA
Good idea. Put it on the cover and
Rubens will be back in no time.
FELIX
We can't do that.
BEATRIZ
Why not?
FELIX
We're only allowed to print what
the military brass lets through.
I'm thinking New York Times, Le
Monde. How's your French?
EUNICE
I don't even know what to say.
BOCA
Talk about being arrested. Eliana,
too.
Eunice lights a cigarette. Her hand shakes, and Dalal
notices.
DALAL
Didn't she want to come?
52.
53.
EUNICE
I sent her to school. Is she well?
DALAL
Yes. She's fine. A little scared.
FELIX
Look, they wouldn't do anything to
a former congressman. That'd make
too much of a splash. We just have
to keep the pressure on and show
them we're watching.
BEATRIZ
We have to do more than that.
LINO
Without any concrete evidence that
he was arrested, there's not much
else we--
EUNICE
-His car.
Everyone turns to her, surprised.
EUNICE (CONT'D)
Rubens' car is parked in the army
lot. I saw it yesterday.
INT. PAIVA FAMILY HOME / MASTER BEDROOM - DAY
The dog watches as Eunice hastily pack clothes into an
overnight bag laid out on the couple's bed. Each shirt has
the initials R.P. monogrammed on the pocket.
She reaches for the hatbox and pulls out Rubens' identity
documents. Maria José comes in.
MARIA JOSÉ
Mr. Machado's out front. Should I
put some coffee on?
EUNICE
No need, we're heading out.
Eunice shuts the suitcase.
EUNICE (CONT'D)
I'll pick the kids up at school.
Just taker care of lunch, please.
53.
54.
MARIA JOSÉ
What would you like me to make?
EUNICE
Whatever there is.
Eunice hastens out. Zezé picks up the dog and heads to the
window. Outside, Eunice gets into Lino's car, overnight bag
in hand. The car pulls out of frame.
EXT. MILITARY DETENTION CENTER / COURTYARD. DAY
A group of SOLDIERS jogs across the courtyard in formation.
SOLDIERS
(chanting)
...shoot some tear gas
in the middle of the mob
ain'ta be no oxygen
folks are gonna drop
an incendiary grenade
a fire-thrower flashes
that troublemaking mob
gonna trample on its ashes...
The group passes by Eunice and Lino, standing by the OPEL
KADETT as an OFFICER fills out a retrieval receipt. Eunice
hands the suitcase to the Officer, who ignores it.
EUNICE
This is a change of clothes and
medicine. My husband is diabetic,
he needs this.
OFFICER
I told you, there's no Rubens here.
EUNICE
Can you tell us where he's been
taken?
OFFICER
(to Lino)
If you want that, you've got to put
in a request to the federal police.
Eunice is about to snap back, but Lino cuts in.
LINO
Okay, then. Can we have the
receipt, please?
54.
55.
The Officer hands over the receipt and the car keys, and
heads back into the barracks.
EUNICE
Where do we make that request?
LINO
No use, they'll just deny it. We'll
have to go through the courts.
Lino hands the car keys to Eunice but hangs onto the receipt.
LINO (CONT'D)
But now, with this, I can file the
habeas corpus.
Eunice points at the folder in Lino's hand.
EUNICE
Can I at least have a look at that?
LINO
God, it's worse than Greek. Are you
sure?
EUNICE
I am. I'll leave the kids home,
then I'll stop by the office to
return it.
LINO
No need. I have a copy. If there's
any news, I'll let you know.
Lino hands her the folder. Eunice enters the car.
LINO (CONT'D)
I didn't know Rubens was diabetic.
EUNICE
He's not.
She tosses the bag into the backseat and takes off.
EXT. GRADE SCHOOL / HALLWAY - DAY
Eunice walks under the arcade surrounding the inner courtyard
while STUDENTS lined up on the lawn sing the school song.
55.
56.
STUDENTS
...pointing the way ahead
Always present in our thoughts
At every fork in the road
Treading the path of the righteous
Toward a life of contentedness...
Among the TEACHERS overseeing the rehearsal, Eunice spots
MARTHA, who was in the military's album. She waves at the
teacher, who forces a smile and walks over to her.
We can't hear their conversation at a distance, but we can
see the smile vanish from Martha's face. She signals at the
girls to keep singing while she leads Eunice away.
STUDENTS (CONT'D)
...with you, we learn the truth
And warmth of a noble heart
Teach us the joys and pleasure
Of fulfilling our mission...
INT. GRADE SCHOOL / CHAPEL - DAY
The children's singing echoes into the background. Eunice
follows Martha, who weaves between the pews picking up
booklets. They speak in whispers.
MARTHA
...I only found out who the letters
were for when I met your husband.
EUNICE
So you saw Rubens there?
MARTHA
We were put in the same car.
EUNICE
Where did they take you?
MARTHA
I don't know. They covered our
heads with a--
EUNICE
-A hood. They did it to me, too.
Martha avoids Eunice and ventures down another pew in search
of more scattered booklets.
MARTHA
What's so hard about putting them
back where they came from?
56.
57.
EUNICE
You've got to make a statement to
the police.
Martha turns to her, surprised.
MARTHA
But they're the ones who arrested
us.
EUNICE
And now they're saying they didn't.
MARTHA
I'm sorry. I can't get involved in
this.
Eunice grabs her arm and raises her voice.
EUNICE
You're the only person who saw him
in there. I need your help. If I
can't prove he was arrested--
Two NUNS come into the chapel. Caught off guard, Martha
smiles abruptly and hands Eunice a prayer booklet.
MARTHA
Please, Eunice, you've got to
leave.
EUNICE
My husband's in danger, Martha.
MARTHA
We're all in danger.
Martha goes over toward the Nuns. Eunice drops the booklet on
a pew and hurries out.
I/E. RUBENS'S OPEL KADETT - DAY
Eunice smokes as she drives, glancing nervously into the rear-
view mirror. Next to her, Eliana bounces a restless leg.
In the backseat, Marcelo plays with their father's oversized
hard hat. Nalu is talking loudly.
NALU
I've missed rehearsals. Cris said I
can go with her.
57.
58.
EUNICE
That's enough, Ana Lúcia.
BABIU
Why's Daddy's car back, but not
him?
EUNICE
He's still on a trip.
NALU
I can walk there!
EUNICE
From now on, you come straight home
from school. And nobody goes out on
their own anymore.
Marcelo notices the overnight bag on the floor. His curiosity
piqued, he opens it up and spots his father's clothes.
MARCELO
But this is Dad's bag!
EUNICE
Leave it there, Marcelo.
In the rear-view mirror, Eunice sees the CREAM-COLORED VW
BEETLE. She changes lanes.
NALU
But what about my ballet? What
about Eliana's volleyball practice?
ELIANA
I quit the team.
EUNICE
Why?
ELIANA
I don't feel like practicing.
Eliana snaps on the radio, avoiding her mother's gaze.
ANNOUNCER
...the search for the terrorists
who carried out the kidnapping...
Eunice turns the radio off. Eliana turns it back on.
ELIANA
Lemme hear, Mom. They're talking
about the ambassador.
58.
59.
ANNOUNCER
...help from the public in locating
the suspects...
Eunice checks the rear-view mirror again and snaps the radio
back off again.
EUNICE
Not for children's ears, honey.
Eliana slouches down in a sulk.
EXT. PAIVA FAMILY HOME - DAY
Maria José, in her maid's uniform, is hosing down the front
walk. The OPEL pulls into the garage. The passenger's door
opens, and the children clamber out and run into the house.
Eunice notices the CREAM-COLORED VW BEETLE on the other side
of the street, two MEN inside. She picks up a barking Pimpão,
and tries to close the gate, which is rusty and sticking.
EUNICE
Where's the key?
MARIA JOSÉ
Does it even have one?
She yanks at the gate, but it won't budge. Maria José puts
down the hose and tries to help.
EUNICE
Let me do it.
Maria José steps back, surprised at her reaction. Eunice puts
Pimpão down and heaves the gate shut. Both women go in. The
water from the hose keeps on trickling down the sidewalk.
INT. PAIVA FAMILY HOME / LAUNDRY ROOM - DAY
Maria José is ironing clothes next to the radio playing a
romantic tune. Eunice comes over and turns the radio off.
EUNICE
What about that car with those men
in it?
MARIA JOSÉ
It's been there for days, Mrs.
Paiva.
59.
60.
EUNICE
But do they do anything?
MARIA JOSÉ
They just sit there. Staring over
here all day.
Eunice notices Maria José's threadbare apron.
EUNICE
Your apron's frayed. I told you
should buy a new one.
MARIA JOSÉ
The cash ran out, so I had to use
the money Mr. Paiva gave me to buy
groceries while you were away.
There wasn't enough for a new one.
Eunice smiles weakly.
EUNICE
Of course. I'll go by the bank
tomorrow and get us some more cash.
MARIA JOSÉ
And... Mrs. Paiva, could you see
about my pay, too? I know you've
got an awful lot on your plate, but
Mr. Paiva only paid me through
December.
EUNICE
I'm sorry Zezé, I'll sort it out.
MARIA JOSÉ
Thank you.
Eunice walks out. Maria José turns the radio back on.
INT. BANK - DAY
In a glass-walled room, Eunice is sitting in front of RITOR,
her stout bank manager, who drops an Alka-Seltzer tablet into
a tall glass of water.
RITOR
Rubens can call to authorize the
withdrawal.
60.
61.
EUNICE
He's overseeing a construction site
in the mountains, and there's no
phone up there. Is there really no
way you can help me, Ritor?
RITOR
I understand, but without his
signature there's nothing I can do.
Ritor takes a drink, eyes closed. Eunice spots a framed
picture of the manager with his family on his desk.
EUNICE
Tell me, how's Miriam doing? We've
got to get together when Rubens is
back.
Ritor shakes his head, giving in.
RITOR
We should.
EUNICE
Well, I brought some dollars and
pounds I had at home. Can you
exchange them for me?
RITOR
Of course, Eunice. I'll get someone
to help you.
EUNICE
Thank you, Ritor.
Ritor goes out. On the wall behind the desk, a uniformed
portrait of General Médici, the military-installed president,
stares straight at Eunice.
INT. PAIVA FAMILY HOME / MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
Nalu opens the parent's closet carefully. She picks out one
of her father's shirts. She goes over to the nightstand and
finds a pack of cigarettes in the drawer.
She puts the shirt on and leans on the windowsill. The girl
lights a cigarette when the bedroom door opens. It's Marcelo.
The children look at one another in silence.
MARCELO
Hey. Where'd Mom go?
61.
62.
NALU
I dunno.
He stares at her cigarette.
MARCELO
Can I have a drag?
NALU
No way.
INT. ENGINEERING FIRM / RUBENS' OFFICE - NIGHT
On the wall are photos of Rubens at construction sites: an
elevated highway, putting down asphalt in a tunnel, during
the building of Brasília.
Eunice, sealed envelope in hand, looks at a framed picture of
the Paivas propped up on a clipboard of unfinished projects.
Boca searches for something in the drawers of Rubens' desk.
BOCA
Gilda called again today. She
managed to get Vera on the waiting
list for a flight next week.
EUNICE
I think it'd be better if she
stayed a while longer. Do you know
how much the ticket is?
BOCA
I'll work it out with Rubens. He'd
better come back soon, to deal with
this mess.
Boca opens the last drawer and cackles.
BOCA (CONT'D)
Son of a bitch.
He pulls out a bottle of imported whiskey.
BOCA (CONT'D)
Do you mind? I'll buy him another.
Eunice shakes her head and lights a cigarette. Boca pours two
glasses with ice.
BOCA (CONT'D)
You sure you don't want to stop by
our place? Everyone's coming--
62.
63.
EUNICE
-Why did they arrest Rubens?
He's taken aback by the question and tries to dodge it.
BOCA
I don't know. The military are
shooting blind, going after anyone.
EUNICE
Don't give me that, Boca. I was
there, in that place. I saw it. I
deserve to know what my husband was
up to. Don't you think?
BOCA
I do.
He puts the bottle down on the desk and speaks quietly.
BOCA (CONT'D)
There's no way to just stand by,
Eunice. Especially us. We have the
means to help. So me, Rubens,
Gaspa, Raul, we all do what we can.
One talks to the foreign press,
another one provides shelter to
people on the run, deliver letters
to families with no news.
Eunice looks at the envelope in her hands.
BOCA (CONT'D)
But we're not involved in the armed
struggle. Much less Rubens.
She nods, taking this in, and snaps back at him.
EUNICE
So you decided not to say a word to
me, to Dalal, to Dalva to protect
us.
BOCA
Of course.
EUNICE
Of course.
She takes a drag and shakes her head.
EUNICE (CONT'D)
And you think Rubens will be
released?
63.
64.
BOCA
I do. He'll be back soon. C'mon,
come have dinner with us. Dalal
will love to see you.
She stubs out her cigarette.
EUNICE
I'm not really in the mood. Too
many kids to raise. Thank you.
INT. PAIVA FAMILY HOME / GIRLS' ROOM - DAY
In Eunice's hands is the open letter. At the top of the page,
we see Veroca's neat handwriting: “London, April '71.”
Eunice is sitting on one of the beds. On the floor, Marcelo
and Eliana are looking at photos we can't see.
EUNICE
(reading aloud)
...These photos are on the subway.
One out front, one inside the
train. We were going to a party at
the Arraes' house...
NALU
Pass it on, Marcelo.
EUNICE
(reading aloud)
You won't believe who was there.
On the other bed, Nalu, who's brushing Babiu's hair,
interrupts.
ELIANA
Caetano?
NALU
Gil?
EUNICE
(reading aloud)
Gilberto Gil! He was wearing polka-
dot velvet pants. A Bob Marley song
started playing, and he asked me to
dance.
NALU
No way.
64.
65.
ELIANA
Such a liar.
Eunice hesitates before carrying it on.
EUNICE
(reading aloud)
I miss the beach, the soufflé, and
you all. I miss everything, Vera.
Nalu stops brushing Babiu's hair as the baby of the family
turns to look at their mother.
BABIU
Is that it?
Eunice folds the letter and puts it back in the envelope.
EUNICE
That's it.
ELIANA
Let me see.
As Eunice reaches to take the photo from her children, they
hear the sound of screeching brakes followed by an agonized
howl. She looks out the window and then closes the blinds.
EUNICE
Stay here.
EXT. PAIVA FAMILY HOME - DAY
Eunice throws the gate open. On the hot asphalt, Pimpão the
dog is lying in a heap. From the CREAM-COLORED VW BEETLE, the
Men stare at her.
MARCELO (O.S.)
Pimpão!
Eunice turns back to the house. Nalu holds her brother back
as he moves to run, desolate, over to the dog. Babiu clutches
Eliana in fright.
Eunice stalks over to the VW BEETLE.
EUNICE
What are you looking at? What do
you want?
The DRIVER puts the key in the ignition and turns it, but the
engine doesn't catch. Eunice raps on the window.
65.
66.
EUNICE (CONT'D)
Where is my husband?!
She keeps on slapping the glass until the car peels out.
EUNICE (CONT'D)
Get out of here!
Worried, Maria José looks at her employer standing in the
street. Eunice smooths down her hair and speaks calmly.
EUNICE (CONT'D)
Zezé, please get me a blanket.
EXT. PAIVA FAMILY HOME / BACKYARD - DAY
Under a drab sky, Babiu and Nalu dig a small grave with their
hands. Eliana watches, stock-still. Maria José tries to calm
Marcelo. Everyone seems devastated.
Eunice places the blanket with the dead dog into the hole and
sticks her hands into the pile of dirt, covering the bundle
as fast as possible.
She notices as Eliana goes back into the house.
INT. PAIVA FAMILY HOME / MASTER BEDROOM - DAY
Eunice finds Eliana holding Veroca's letter.
ELIANA
(reading aloud)
... The Brazilian exiles were asking
about Dad, Mom, and Eliana. I didn't
know what to say. I got this awful
feeling.
EUNICE
Give me that letter.
ELIANA
(reading aloud)
Why don't you tell me anything? I
found out about your arrests from the
papers. What's going on?
The girl turns to her mother, looking furious.
ELIANA (CONT'D)
Why didn't you read the rest?
66.
67.
EUNICE
That's not for children's eyes.
Eunice grabs the envelope, but Eliana won't let it go.
ELIANA
You skipped the part about Dad and
me--
EUNICE
-Enough, Eliana. Give it to me.
Eliana yanks the letter back, and it rips in half.
ELIANA
You're lying to us!
Rattled, Eunice slaps her daughter across the face.
EUNICE
Go to your room.
Eliana stares at her, in shock, and runs off to her room. We
hear the door slam.
Eunice slumps down onto the stool in front of the dressing
table. She puts the ripped letter back in the envelope and
notices the dirt on her hands.
In the bathroom, Eunice scrubs her hands under hot water.
INT. PAIVA FAMILY HOME / STUDY - LATE NIGHT
Rain. Eunice rereads the writ of habeas corpus. There are
notes in the margins, and she's jotting down observations. As
she lights a cigarette, there's a noise at the door.
Startled, she slowly straightens up in the chair.
INT. PAIVA FAMILY HOME / LIVING ROOM - LATE NIGHT
Headlights rake across the dark room. Through the wet window,
Eunice spots a car idling outside.
A FIGURE comes out of the car and up to the house. Eunice
quietly makes sure the front door is locked. An envelope is
slipped under the door, addressed simply to EUNICE.
She opens the door, and her eyes meet Martha's through the
car window before the vehicle vanishes down the dark, empty
street.
67.
68.
INT. PAIVA FAMILY HOME / STUDY - LATE NIGHT
The torn envelope lies on top of the scale model of the
house. Eunice is on her feet, smoking anxiously as her eyes
scan the letter.
We hear Martha whisper, in the same tone as when Eunice met
her at the school chapel.
MARTHA (O.S.)
...I still can't describe the
excruciating hours I spent in
prison, but I can guarantee you
that I was there with your husband.
Although I couldn't see him, I
heard him say: Rubens Beyrodt
Paiva. Before I was transferred, I
heard his voice one last time,
asking for water. I pray that the
family will be reunited soon. Give
my best to my old students Vera,
Eliana, and Ana.
Eunice grabs the phone and dials hastily.
EUNICE
(on the phone)
I'm sorry to call this late, Lino,
but we've got a witness.
She smiles. In her hands, the hope of reuniting with Rubens.
INT. PAIVA FAMILY HOME / LIVING ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON
The doors open and the children file in, wearing their school
uniforms and backpacks. Eunice follows, carrying her purse
and the folder with the writ of habeas corpus.
EUNICE
There's still time for a swim.
Anyone?
NALU
It's kind of late.
MARCELO
I'm hungry.
Maria José comes out of the kitchen with Babiu.
EUNICE
Zezé, no need to cook. We're going for
ice cream.
68.
69.
MARCELO
I want French fries.
BABIU
I want a strawberry sundae.
EUNICE
Today, you can order whatever you
want.
EXT. LEBLON BEACH - LATE AFTERNOON
Elegant in her black swimsuit, Eunice swims through the sea
with strong, determined strokes. She pierces the surf and
makes her way through the darkening waters of late afternoon.
Then she's floating, looking up at the orange-tinted sky. She
closes her eyes and takes a deep breath. Time seems to stop
for a moment. Until peace is shattered.
ELIANA (O.S.)
Mom!
Eunice opens her eyes.
ELIANA (O.S.) (CONT'D)
Mom!
Eunice looks back at the beach. Eliana is standing next to
Felix, on the sand. The faint smile vanishes from her face.
INT. PAIVA FAMILY HOME / STUDY - NIGHT
Sitting in Rubens' armchair, Felix avoids Eunice's gaze. Her
hair wet, in a towel and leaning up against the desk, she
hugs herself as if she were cold.
FELIX
‘Died in combat,' Médici said.
That's all.
Eunice doesn't move for a long time. She turns her face away
and searches for the pack of cigarettes on top of the desk.
EUNICE
Can you publish that?
FELIX
Not yet. Not even abroad. They
won't admit it officially.
69.
70.
EUNICE
We have to talk to Lino. He'll know
what to do.
FELIX
There's nothing we can do now.
EUNICE
What do you mean? We have to force
them to admit it publicly. A
subpoena, a court order.
FELIX
We believe we have to keep asking
for his release, as if we didn't
know what happened to him.
EUNICE
So my phone will keep on being
tapped? To have someone parked
outside my house all day long?
FELIX
You're not alone in this.
She nods ever so slightly, then goes back to searching for
cigarettes. She finds it and speaks in a low voice.
EUNICE
What about the body?
FELIX
All I know is what I told you.
EUNICE
But what do you think happened?
Tell me.
Felix looks at Eunice. Her eyes are welling up.
FELIX
I've heard it all. Buried in the
forest, dropped into the sea from a
helicopter, mass graves. It's all
rumors. There's no way to know,
'cause nobody will talk. They're
afraid of disappearing, too.
She brings a cigarette to her lips, but doesn't light it.
EUNICE
Do you mind if I don't walk you
out?
70.
71.
FELIX
I'm sorry. I wish I were the bearer
of better news.
INT. PAIVA FAMILY HOME / LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Eliana is hovering by the study door. On the couch, Nalu
paints her nails. Marcelo is watching TV with a bag of snacks
on his lap. Babiu, doll in hand, pesters her brother.
BABIU
C'mon, let's play.
ANCHORMAN
...the inauguration of the Trans-
Amazonian, the first federal
highway to cross Brazil from east
to west, built in record time, is
slated for early next year...
Felix emerges, and Eliana walks him out.
ELIANA
What were you talking about?
FELIX
I just came by to bring your mom
something.
ELIANA
Did you find out where my dad is?
Eliana looks at Felix suspiciously.
FELIX
Not yet. Take care, okay?
He strokes her head affectionately and rushes out. Planted
squarely by the couch, Babiu tugs on her brother's shirt.
BABIU
The news is so boring.
MARCELO
Then go play with your stupid doll.
NALU
Cut it out, you two.
BABIU
But you promised.
71.
72.
MARCELO
Scat!
Marcelo yanks the doll out of his sister's hands and throws
it on the floor. Its plastic body breaks into pieces.
INT. PAIVA FAMILY HOME / STUDY - NIGHT
Babiu, holding the pieces of her doll, barges in. Eunice is
in the same position, her back to the door.
BABIU
Mommy, Marcelo broke my doll.
Babiu realizes she's been crying and takes a step back,
alarmed. Eunice turns her face away and dries her tears.
EUNICE
C'mere, give it to me.
Babiu gives her the doll and watches as her mother ably snaps
the pieces together.
EUNICE (CONT'D)
There you go.
BABIU
Were you crying?
Eunice hands the doll back and gives her daughter a kiss.
EUNICE
Tell the others to get dressed.
Let's go out for ice cream.
INT. DINER - NIGHT
At the same large table in the back, the kids dip into
sundaes. Eliana shoots a worried look at her mother, who is
smoking, lost in thought.
Eunice's gaze wanders across the families out for a Sunday
treat. From her perspective, they move slowly and the hubbub
of voices fades away, as if time had jolted out of joint.
Gradually, sounds of helicopter blades cut into the scene.
INT. PAIVA FAMILY HOME / MASTER BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT
The thudding of the helicopter crescendoes into a deafening
roar.
72.
73.
Eunice awakes with a start. The emptiness beside her seems to
take her breath away. She turns on the lamp and sees her
disheveled and confused reflection in the dressing-table.
She walks over to the window and smokes looking blankly out
at the vastness of the sea, invisible in the dark of night.
EXT. PLOT OF LAND IN JARDIM BOTÂNICO - MORNING
A stake is ripped out of the dirt. Then another.
Eunice grabs a third stake, marking the bounds of the house
that will never be completed, and rips it up furiously. A
fourth stake, stuck deep into the earth, resists.
Eunice keeps on until she yanks it out, and dusts off her
hands without dirtying her dress.
INT. ENGINEERING FIRM / RUBENS' OFFICE - DAY
There are new EMPLOYEES in the firm now, huddled around a
drawing board. They take discreet looks at Eunice and Boca as
they stand around Rubens's old desk.
The only thing of his left is the family portrait. Eunice
waits as Boca fills out a check.
BOCA
Look, are you sure? If you wait
till the deed is in order, we can
get a much better price.
EUNICE
I've got too much to do. I prefer
it this way.
BOCA
I can loan you money, that's no
trouble. That piece of land is a
gem, and you can still build the
house someday.
EUNICE
Thanks for managing to sell it
without the proper papers.
Boca signs the check and hands it to her.
BOCA
I'm so sorry, Eunice. I wish I
could've done more--
73.
74.
EUNICE
-It wasn't your fault.
BOCA
If you need anything, anything at
all, for you or for the kids, just
let me know.
Eunice takes the check, picks up the family photo and leaves.
Boca, sitting in what was once his friend's chair, buries his
head in his hands.
INT. BANK - DAY
Eunice's hand takes the check out of her purse, puts it on
the counter and slides it under the glass towards the TELLER.
TELLER
For deposit?
EUNICE
Cash, please.
On the other side of the glass, behind the Teller, Eunice
spots Ritor talking to someone out of frame. Their eyes meet
and the manager awkwardly goes off without greeting her.
The teller's hands slip a wad of bills under the glass.
Eunice picks it up and puts it in her purse.
INT. PAIVA FAMILY HOME / MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
Sitting in front of the mirror on her dressing table, Eunice
sets aside a number of bills from the wad. She counts again,
checks the sum, and puts them in an envelope.
INT. PAIVA FAMILY HOME / LAUNDRY ROOM - NIGHT
Eunice knocks on a door at the back of the laundry room,
Maria José's bedroom. In her other hand is the sealed
envelope. The door opens and Eunice goes in. The door closes.
After a few moments, Eunice comes out, empty-handed.
Her eyes are drawn to the clothes on the line. She touches
them: they're dry. Without a second thought, she starts
pulling them down and putting them in a basket.
74.
75.
INT. PAIVA FAMILY HOME / MARIA JOSÉ'S ROOM - NIGHT
Maria José's calloused hands pick up a framed photo of her
and her son from the small bureau. She nestles the picture
among her clothes, alongside a statuette of the Virgin Mary,
in a suitcase open on the single bed.
Maria José goes over the window and lights a cigarette, her
hand shaking slightly. Leaning on the windowsill, she smokes
looking at the laundry room. The line of clothes is empty.
INT. RIO INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT / ARRIVALS - DAY
Veroca, darker hair and paler skin, walks across the arrivals
lobby, toting a backpack covered with bands' buttons. She's
wearing her winter boots, already battered.
She spots a group of SOLDIERS checking baggage and IDs.
Veroca looks down and picks up the pace.
She makes her way past other PASSENGERS around the baggage
carousel, headed for a revolving door under an exit sign.
INT. RIO INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT / MAIN TERMINAL - DAY
Veroca comes through the door and spots Eunice, Babiu and
Marcelo waiting for her in the cramped, bustling terminal.
Her face tenses as she tries to hold in her emotions.
Her mother waves, smiling ear to ear at the sight of her. Her
siblings run over, followed by Eunice, who wraps Veroca in a
hug and, eyes closed, takes in the smell of her daughter.
EUNICE
We missed you so much.
MARCELO
Did you know Pimpão got hit by a
car?
EUNICE
Marcelo!
BABIU
He's talking about the dog.
Marcelo guffaws, as does Babiu. Veroca strokes her sister's
hair.
VEROCA
You got bigger, Babiu.
75.
76.
Babiu points at the buttons on Veroca's backpack.
BABIU
Can I have one?
VEROCA
As many as you want. And where are
Nalu and Eliana?
Eunice looks around, checks her watch and starts heading for
the door. Veroca finds her reaction strange.
EUNICE
They stayed home to wait for the
reporters from Manchete.
VEROCA
Why are those shills coming over?
EUNICE
They need a picture today to get it
into the next edition.
The children trail after their mother as she walks quickly
out, weaving between the families waiting for other arrivals.
I/E. RUBENS'S OPEL KADETT - DAY
Veroca's hand tunes the radio until she finds a Brazilian
music station. She sits back and watches the city roll past
through her sunglasses.
While she's relieved to be back home, there's a strange note,
as if everything has changed while she was gone.
Eunice lights a cigarette, catching Veroca's attention. She
turns the radio down and leans over to her mother.
VEROCA
Mom, I have to tell you something.
EUNICE
What's that?
VEROCA
Your jacket... I left it with
Helena. She begged me so long I
just couldn't say no.
Veroca shrinks, expecting a telling-off.
76.
77.
EUNICE
That's all right, it'd been stored
away for so long. Helena will make
better use of it in London.
Veroca is surprised by this response. She notices that her
mother is gripping the wheel tightly, her eyes flitting to
the rear-view mirror.
VEROCA
Are you all right?
Eunice turns to her daughter with a smile on her face.
EUNICE
Sure I am, honey. How about you?
Veroca looks back at the backseat: Babiu and Marcelo are
examining the buttons on her backpack. Veroca leans over to
her mother and speaks quietly, choosing her words carefully.
VEROCA
Have you heard any news?
Eunice cuts her daughter off brusquely.
EUNICE
Vera, please, the kids.
VEROCA
In London, it's in all the papers--
EUNICE
-Honey.
Eunice turns up the radio, cutting the conversation short.
Veroca sits back and looks out the window. Outside, the broad
lanes of Avenida Brasil slip past under the harsh noon light.
EXT. PAIVA FAMILY HOME - DAY
Behind a camera on a tripod, a PHOTOGRAPHER squints through
the viewfinder and gesticulates with his hands held high.
PHOTOGRAPHER
Closer, get closer in.
The lens frames the family, posed on the front steps.
PHOTOGRAPHER (CONT'D)
Just scooch in a little more. Got
to fit all of you.
77.
78.
They all squeeze in a little closer.
EUNICE
Is everyone in the picture?
PHOTOGRAPHER
Yep. All ready? Three... two...
He's about to press the shutter when Eunice speaks.
EUNICE
Smile.
Marcelo starts laughing. Babiu tries to hold it in, but soon
explodes in giggles, too. The JOURNALIST working with the
Photographer addresses the family.
JOURNALIST
You don't have to smile.
EUNICE
Why not?
PHOTOGRAPHER
The editor asked for it.
EUNICE
For what?
PHOTOGRAPHER
He asked for a photo that's more...
more... you know, less happy.
EUNICE
He wants a sad photo?
The comment makes the children guffaw even harder. Now Nalu
and Eliana are laughing, too. Eunice notices, and smiles.
PHOTOGRAPHER
It doesn't have to be sad, but just
no smiling.
EUNICE
We're going to smile.
Eunice breaks into a broad smile. Veroca, still out of place,
can't make sense of her mother and siblings' reaction.
JOURNALIST
How about serious? Can we get
serious for a second?
78.
79.
EUNICE
Smile.
Defeated, and a little irritated, the Photographer takes the
photo. In the picture, everyone is smiling except Veroca.
INT. PAIVA FAMILY HOME / LIVING ROOM - DAY
Veroca comes down the stairs, fresh from the shower. She
hears Eunice's voice in the study. Through the half-open
door, she spots her mother smoking and speaking in a
deliberate tone as the Journalist takes notes.
EUNICE
I really don't understand, how in a
country with an allegedly
functioning justice system, someone
can break into your house, take a
father away, throw him in jail, and
then simply say “he's gone.” And
there's not a thing you can do?
Every single stage of the legal
process was flouted, and after
three months, the nature of the
crime my husband allegedly
committed remains a mystery, as do
his whereabouts.
JOURNALIST
The inquiry was recently archived,
right?
EUNICE
My lawyer has filed a request to
reopen it. This is unacceptable
behavior by the State, which is
protected by a system of false news
designed to cover up the unlawful
acts committed by its own agents...
Veroca watches Eunice: a woman she no longer recognizes.
INT. PAIVA FAMILY HOME / KITCHEN / DINNING ROOM - DAY
Nalu in an apron heats up lunch, Marcelo sets the table and
Babiu puts out napkins. Eliana is the only one seated,
waiting for lunch. Veroca is surprised by the whole scene.
VEROCA
Is Zezé off today?
79.
80.
NALU
She doesn't work here anymore.
VEROCA
Why?
NALU
We can't afford to pay her.
Veroca tries not to let her surprise show.
VEROCA
Let me help you, then.
NALU
That's okay. Tomorrow you can start
on the rotation.
Nalu points at the fridge. On the door, hung up with a
magnet, is a list of chores with the children's name next to
them. Veroca notices that Eliana's name under WASH DISHES.
VEROCA
Let me get the dishes for you
today, Eliana.
ELIANA
If you insist.
VEROCA
You okay?
Eliana looks up at her sister and nods soberly. Veroca lowers
her voice, careful not to let their siblings overhear.
VEROCA (CONT'D)
What's going on? I heard that they
took you along with Mom, but nobody
could tell me how--
ELIANA
--we can't talk about that at home.
Eunice's arrival interrupts the moment between the girls.
EUNICE
I wish I could've made a welcome-
home soufflé, honey, but there was
no time.
Nalu carries the dish over to the table. The children take
their seats. Veroca just stands there.
80.
81.
EUNICE (CONT'D)
Not hungry?
VEROCA
I think it'll take a few days for
me to get over the time difference.
NALU
Where's Veroca going to sleep now
that I'm in her bedroom?
VEROCA
I don't care.
NALU
Can't Eliana sleep with
Marcelo and Babiu and I stay
with Veroca?
BABIU
I don't want to sleep with
Eliana, Mommy, can I stay
with you?
ELIANA
I'm not going anywhere. Nalu
has to go back to the kids'
room.
MARCELO
Daddy said I'm going to have
a room to myself because I'm
a boy.
Eunice interrupts everyone, speaking loudly and firmly.
EUNICE
You can cut out the arguing right
now, because nobody's going to have
a room of their own anymore.
They all look at their mother, surprised.
ELIANA
What?
EUNICE
We're going back to São Paulo.
NALU
Are you serious?
EUNICE
I am. Grandma and Grandpa are
there, and you can stay with them
now and then. Because I'm going
back to college.
VEROCA
You're what?
ELIANA
I'm not going.
81.
82.
EUNICE
Eliana, please--
BABIU
-What about the new house?
EUNICE
It'll have to wait a little,
sweetie.
ELIANA
What about Dad?
The children look at Eunice, who puts down her utensils and
tries to keep her cool.
EUNICE
I know it's hard to understand, but
you'll just have to be patient.
This process is--
ELIANA
-And what if he comes back and
we're not here anymore?
Eunice speaks even more firmly.
EUNICE
This house is already rented out.
It's going to become a restaurant.
I want each of you to pack your
things, and on Friday, a moving
truck will pull up out front.
Eliana runs upstairs. Eunice doesn't budge. She takes a deep
breath and speaks quietly, seemingly unmoved.
EUNICE (CONT'D)
Pass the rice, Marcelo.
Marcelo obeys. Everyone starts eating as if nothing had
happened. Veroca sits down and serves herself in silence.
INT. PAIVA FAMILY HOME / STUDY - LATE NIGHT
The shelves are nearly empty, and there are piles of books
all over the ground.
Eunice gathers newspaper articles, clippings of interviews,
and the writ of habeas corpus. She puts it all away into a
moving box and writes RUBENS on it.
82.
83.
She comes across the box of photographs. Inside is the Super
8 film sent by Veroca, along with a jumble of family photos
from years past. She writes on the box: PHOTOS - ORGANIZE.
In a drawer, Eunice comes across Babiu's baby tooth. She
hears footsteps crossing the living room. Eunice closes the
box, goes over to the door and cracks it open, curious.
INT. PAIVA FAMILY HOME / KITCHEN - LATE NIGHT
The garage door is open. In the half-light, Eunice spots
Veroca and Pimpão leaning up against the hood of his car.
She watches her daughter's movements. Veroca is looking down,
worried. Pimpão strokes her hair, and she turns away.
EXT. PAIVA FAMILY HOME - DAY
A moving truck is parked outside the house, and MOVERS are
carrying out boxes and pieces of furniture. Marcelo says
goodbye to his friends, and hands one his kite.
MARCELO
Keep this for me?
Eunice comes out of the house with a box and gives it to
Veroca, who's helping to load up the car, along with Nalu.
EUNICE
Have you seen Eliana?
The girls shake their heads. Eunice finds Babiu holding her
doll, crestfallen. She holds out two closed fists.
EUNICE (CONT'D)
Pick one.
Babiu points at the left one. Her mother skillfully whirls
her hands around and winds up opening her right fist. In it
is the tooth.
BABIU
How did you find it? Only Daddy knew.
EUNICE
Your mom knows a lot of things, too.
Babiu smiles and gives her a kiss.
EUNICE (CONT'D)
Get in the car, it's time to go.
83.
84.
Babiu obeys. Eunice enters the house for the last time.
INT. PAIVA FAMILY HOME - DAY
Two MOVERS carry the armchairs from the study across the
living room. The place seems much larger now it's empty.
EUNICE
Eliana?
Eunice goes into the kitchen and comes back. She pokes her
head into the study.
EUNICE (CONT'D)
Sweetie?
She goes up the stairs. The children's rooms are empty as
well. From the bedroom window, Eunice spots something on the
beach.
EXT. LEBLON BEACH - DAY
Eliana stares out at the horizon, her feet sinking into the
wet sand. Eunice comes up to her daughter and the two of them
face the sea, in silence.
I/E. RUBENS'S OPEL KADETT - DAY
The doors of the Opel are closed. Eliana is sitting next to
Eunice. Squeezed into the backseat are Marcelo, Nalu, Babiu.
They're all quiet. Their reflective expressions reveal that
this is a rite of passage for the whole family.
Eunice starts the car and sets off. Veroca turns back and
notices the Super 8 camera in the trunk. She picks it up,
looks through the viewfinder, and pulls the trigger.
In the grainy image, we see the family's house pulling away.
INT. GYM - DAY - SÃO PAULO, 1996
There are only a handful of SWIMMERS in the clear waters of
the heated pool.
In one lane, a young woman swims quickly to the end and does
a flip turn without coming up. She reaches the other end and
pulls off her goggles to check the wall clock. It's Babiu.
84.
85.
EXT. OVERPASS - LATE AFTERNOON
Her hair wet, Babiu walks across the overpass, wearing
headphones and toting a gym bag.
Behind her is a landscape unlike anything we've seen yet:
tall buildings as far as the eye can see.
Babiu comes up to a corner building and goes in.
INT. EUNICE'S APARTMENT / LIVING ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON
The living room overlooks the overpass. In it are objects,
paintings, and furniture from the Paivas' old home.
Babiu drops her gym bag on the long dining room table and
takes off her headphones. The clacking of the electric
typewriter guides her down the hallway.
INT. EUNICE'S APARTMENT / STUDY - LATE AFTERNOON
Eunice, face marked by the years, smokes as she types away,
flanked by bookcases filled with archival storage boxes and
methodically organized folders.
On the shelves are PHOTOS OF HER GROWN CHILDREN, and of her
at her LAW SCHOOL GRADUATION CEREMONY.
Babiu emerges in the doorway.
BABIU
You got in early.
Eunice turns, pulls off her glasses, and smiles.
EUNICE
Hi, honey. I rescheduled my flight.
BABIU
I'm going to eat out with Daniel. Want
to come?
EUNICE
I can't, Babiu. I'll just heat
something up.
At the top of the page, Babiu reads: LAND REPOSSESSION. Among
the legal documents, marked-up books and colorful Post-Its,
she notices a PHOTO OF HER MOTHER BY A SINGLE-ENGINE PLANE.
85.
86.
BABIU
I can't handle you in those little
airplanes.
EUNICE
By land, it's impossible. It takes
three days and the area is swarming
with land grabbers.
BABIU
I thought you kicked them out last
time.
EUNICE
Yeah, me too.
Babiu pins the photo up on a cork board.
BABIU
When do you leave tomorrow?
EUNICE
Manuela will pick me up at six-forty.
(checks wristwatch)
I haven't even started preparing my
talk.
BABIU
We can have breakfast together.
Babiu leaves, and Eunice quickly gets back to her work. In
VOICE OVER, we hear Eunice in the next scene:
EUNICE (O.S.)
...The legal tools we have to try to
prevent the illegal occupation of
these areas...
INT. LAW SCHOOL / AUDITORIUM - DAY
In the half-light, Eunice speaks next to a tripod projector
screen showing aerial photographs of Indigenous villages.
CLICK. Eunice flips to the next slide as STUDENTS take notes.
EUNICE
...and the entire region affected by
the Transamazonian highway are: First,
file for the annulment of fraudulent
contracts by land grabbers, which
Manuela and I did for the Pataxós.
CLICK. The projector shows a single-engine plane in a
village, echoing the snapshot we saw in the previous scene.
86.
87.
EUNICE (CONT'D)
Second, enforce the 1988
Constitution, since it requires the
government to guarantee Indigenous
peoples' rights to their land.
MANUELA, 50, who's operating the projector, raises her voice.
MANUELA
Whoever's interested in reading
Eunice's full report, you can pick
up a copy after class.
The door opens, casting a ray of light into the dark. An
ASSISTANT steps in and whispers something into Manuela's ear,
pointing toward Eunice.
EUNICE
It's a lengthy process, but it was
important to establish the legal
precedent which--
Manuela gets up, cutting her off.
MANUELA
-Eunice, I'm sorry. Urgent phone call
for you.
INT. LAW SCHOOL / OFFICE - DAY
A receiver off the hook is awaiting her on a desk thick with
folders. Eunice hastens over to it and brings the phone to
her ear, tense. We're left out, wondering what she's hearing.
Suddenly, Eunice's knees give way. She puts a hand on the
desk to steady herself and then covers her face, in shock.
EXT. COURTHOUSE - DAY
A motorized wheelchair trundles across the pavement. In it is
MARCELO, kitted out in a white dress shirt and tie. Beside
him, Babiu and Eunice quicken their step.
EUNICE
Couldn't you comb your hair, Marcelo?
Eunice tries to fix her son's hair, but he dodges.
MARCELO
I already put on a tie, Mom.
Babiu laughs. The three of them enter the imposing building.
87.
88.
INT. COURTHOUSE / LOBBY - DAY
The wheelchair picks up speed on the marble floor. Eunice and
her children come up to the security checkpoint, amidst
LAWYERS and their CLIENTS.
MARCELO
Need some room here.
EUNICE
Excuse us, please.
Eunice shows her bar association card to MARLON, 30, a
uniformed guard who smiles at her.
EUNICE (CONT'D)
Good morning, Marlon. These are my
children Marcelo and Beatriz. Is your
little one better?
MARLON
Yeah, he's already back to school.
EUNICE
Give Ivone my best.
MARLON
Sure, Mrs. Paiva. And congratulations.
Marlon holds the turnstile gate open and they go through.
INT. COURTHOUSE - DAY
They come into an office. Eunice walks up to a reception
desk.
EUNICE
So is it really here, Carla?
From behind a PC emerges the clerk CARLA, 25.
CARLA
Yes, Mrs. Paiva.
Carla sets her coffee cup aside and motions to another CLERK,
who goes off to fetch the document. Carla leans over toward
Marcelo, bashful.
CARLA (CONT'D)
Sorry to bother, Marcelo, but when
your mom said you'd be coming in...
88.
89.
Carla picks up a battered copy of the book Happy Old Year and
hands it to Marcelo.
CARLA (CONT'D)
Do you mind signing it?
MARCELO
Of course not. It's Carla, right?
Carla nods, and hands Marcelo a pen. He signs with some
difficulty, given his weakened hand.
MARCELO (CONT'D)
Did you like it?
CARLA
I cried a lot.
MARCELO
Really? It was supposed to be funny.
CARLA
The story of your accident... Wow. It
got me right here.
MARCELO
Was there too much swearing?
CARLA
No.
MARCELO
(to Eunice)
See? You're the only one who gets on
my case about my language.
The Clerk hands RUBENS' DEATH CERTIFICATE to Eunice, who
stares at the official document, a smile on her lips.
EUNICE
Thank you.
BABIU
Can I see it?
She hands the document to her daughter, moved by it.
CARLA
The press is here, Mrs. Paiva. Can
I let them up?
89.
90.
INT. COURTHOUSE / LOBBY - DAY
CAMERAS FLASH. Eunice proudly holds up the death certificate
for the JOURNALISTS to see. Marcelo is by her side. Babiu, at
a distance, watches her mother field questions.
EUNICE
It's odd, you know, to feel relief
with a death certificate.
REPORTER (O.S.)
How did you deal with the void left
by your husband?
EUNICE
Forced disappearances were one of
the regime's cruelest acts. You
kill one person, but condemn all
the rest to eternal psychological
torture.
REPORTER 2 (O.S.)
After the return of democracy,
doesn't the government have more
urgent issues than fixing the past?
EUNICE
No. I think it's absolutely
necessary to compensate the
families and do the most important
thing, clarify and judge all crimes
committed during the dictatorship.
Otherwise, they will continue to be
committed with impunity.
More CAMERAS FLASH.
INT. EUNICE'S APARTMENT / LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Marcelo, without his tie, lights a cigarette as he stares at
the death certificate lying on the dinner table. Behind him,
Eunice looks for something in a cupboard.
MARCELO
Mom, not the cheap stuff, eh?
EUNICE
After the third round, who can tell?
Eunice brings over a bottle of imported whiskey and pours out
three glasses.
90.
91.
MARCELO
Now that this is finally over, how
about retirement?
EUNICE
Retirement, Marcelo?
Babiu comes up with the same box of photos we've seen in the
past and puts it down on the table.
BABIU
Take a break. Come visit me and Daniel
in Bern, take a little rest.
EUNICE
To rest I have to be at the beach.
MARCELO
Then go for it.
They toast. Marcelo makes an approving face.
MARCELO (CONT'D)
Yep, it's the good one.
Babiu picks up the certificate, brimming with pride.
BABIU
Mom, you did it.
Eunice smiles discreetly before taking the document from her
daughter's hands and setting it aside.
EUNICE
This piece of paper might well get the
ball rolling, but it doesn't say what
happened. And it doesn't say who's
responsible. We've still got a long
way to go.
Babiu opens up the box of photos.
EUNICE (CONT'D)
We're not opening that now.
BABIU
I just did.
EUNICE
I still have to organize this mess.
BABIU
The paper asked for a photo of Dad.
91.
92.
EUNICE
You do that, and I'll call Vera.
The kids must be back from school.
Eunice goes over to the phone. She dials, waits as it rings,
then smiles.
EUNICE (CONT'D)
(on the phone)
Hi, honey. Yeah, it went fine. We
just got home.
BABIU
Send my love.
MARCELO
Give my best to George.
Eunice goes into the bedroom. Marcelo takes a photo from the
box.
MARCELO (CONT'D)
Look at Pimpão and Zezé.
Babiu finds the photo of Veroca's going-away party.
BABIU
Remember what this was?
MARCELO
Was it Nalu's birthday?
BABIU
No, Dalva and Gaspa aren't in it.
Marcelo picks up a photo of him and Babiu with their father.
MARCELO
Look at us.
They look at the photo in silence. Then Babiu says quietly:
BABIU
When did you bury him?
MARCELO
What do you mean?
BABIU
The day you realized he wasn't coming
back?
Marcelo looks away, thoughtful.
92.
93.
MARCELO
I think it was when I saw Mom donating
his clothes. About a year and a half
later. What about you?
BABIU
I think it was when we left Rio.
Seeing the house all empty.
MARCELO
That soon?
EUNICE (O.S.)
Vera sends her love.
Eunice comes back, digital camera in hand. Babiu shows her
the photo of Veroca's send-off.
BABIU
When was this?
EUNICE
I think it was Vera's birthday.
Eunice tucks it away in the box of photos and shuts it.
EUNICE (CONT'D)
Shall we take a photo for your
sisters?
She rests the camera on the box of photos.
MARCELO
Can she use the timer?
BABIU
We're about to find out.
Eunice pushes a button, and a light starts blinking. It
flashes faster as she takes her place between her children.
EUNICE
Smile.
The three of them smile. FLASH!
INT. EUNICE'S APARTMENT / BABIU'S BEDROOM - DAY
Babiu is finishing packing her suitcase. Among her clothes,
she tucks away the photo that her mother took on the night
they got the death certificate.
93.
94.
She shuts the suitcase and puts it on the floor, next to
another bag. The room is emptied out – only a few books and
objects remain.
INT. EUNICE'S APARTMENT / EUNICE'S BEDROOM - DAY
Eunice counts foreign money. She gets confused halfway
through and begins again. She loses her count once more and
before she can start over, Babiu comes in.
BABIU
Need help, Mom?
Eunice hides her confusion, shuffles the bills together and
hands them over.
EUNICE
Check it, I think it's all in order.
BABIU
As soon as I get the grant, I'll pay
you back.
Eunice jots figures down in her notebook.
EUNICE
It's all set out here, don't worry.
Let's go before rush hour.
BABIU
You really don't need to, Mom.
Daniel's coming to pick me up.
Eunice looks at her daughter, trying to hold in her emotion.
EUNICE
Oh, okay. Call me when you get in?
BABIU
I will. I'll miss you.
EUNICE
Me too, honey.
EXT. EUNICE'S APARTMENT / FRONT - LATE AFTERNOON
We see at a distance as Eunice hugs Babiu and DANIEL (35),
who has a ponytail, next to a taxi. The couple goes in, and
the car takes off.
Eunice stands there for a while. Then she looks around, turns
on her heel and strides back into the building.
94.
95.
INT. EUNICE'S APARTMENT / ELEVATOR - LATE AFTERNOON
Eunice notices her reflection in the mirror, alone. She steps
closer and checks the graying roots in her hair.
INT. EUNICE'S APARTMENT / STUDY - NIGHT
Eunice looks at the death certificate for a moment before
picking up a bulging binder labeled RUBENS.
She flips through pages full of newspaper and magazine
clippings, remnants of years of struggle. We see fragments:
- Jornal do Brasil, 1979: “Who killed Rubens Paiva?”
- Afinal Magazine, 1985, a photo of Martha, with the
headline: "Teacher states in court that she saw Rubens Paiva
being beaten."
- Amilcar Lobo in Veja Magazine, 1986: “Former military
officer breaks silence and reveals that Rubens Paiva was
murdered at state police headquarters."
Eunice comes to the last page, where she tucks away the death
certificate. She closes the binder matter-of-factly, puts it
back on the shelf, and picks up the box of photos.
She opens it, and the first one she sees is the family photo
on the beach. She looks at the image, concentrating. Then she
turns the photo over and picks up a pen.
The ballpoint hovers in the air for a moment, then she writes
with a firm hand: VEROCA'S FAREWELL PARTY, 1970.
As she puts the photo back in the box, she notices a roll of
Super 8 film among the jumble of snapshots.
INT. EUNICE'S APARTMENT / LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Eunice places the old projector on the dining table, turned
toward the blank wall. She ably slots in the film – her hands
still know what to do.
She turns on the projector. Eunice's eyes shine damply. Far
from all the rest, she finally lets herself melt as she
watches happy images of a time that will never return.
95.
96.
SUPER 8
The Paivas are on the beach on a sunny morning in 1970.
Rubens plays with the children in the sand and kisses Eunice,
who grins.
EXT. VEROCA'S HOUSE / BACKYARD PATIO - DAY - SÃO PAULO, 2014
The image of JOAQUIM, 2, fills a cell phone screen. He's
being filmed by Marcelo, who smiles as he sees his son dance
clumsily on the lap of his mother, SÍLVIA, 35.
MARCELO
Blow a kiss to Daddy.
They're finishing up lunch with GUESTS and FAMILY MEMBERS. It
almost feels like the house in Leblon, with people scattered
all around the backyard and music playing.
At one end of the long table is Eunice, her hair white, in a
wheelchair. Her eyes are fixed on her grandson. It's as if
nothing else exists for her.
MARCELO (CONT'D)
I was looking for that one of them in
Bariloche.
ELIANA
I have the one from Manchete, the
one at the beach...
VEROCA
I have the ones from college.
MARCELO
And from Brasilia, are there any
left?
ELIANA
I don't think so. None survived.
But there’s the one with the
pigeons.
VEROCA
It's great for the cover.
MARCELO
That's up to the publisher.
ELIANA
I'll check what I have, scan and
send it to you.
96.
97.
BABIU (O.S.)
Put them on a pen drive for me,
please.
Babiu comes from the kitchen with a carton of ice cream,
along with Nalu, bearing a dish with a withered soufflé.
VEROCA
We have soufflé!
NALU
A total failure, it deflated. No
jokes, okay?
Marcelo comes over to get a look at the dish.
MARCELO
A sorry sight, eh, Mrs. Paiva?
NALU
If Mrs. Paiva had written down the
recipe...
BABIU
Now it's Mom's fault. Lucky us, I
brought some ice cream.
The siblings chuckle.
VEROCA
Anything else, Mom?
Eunice doesn't respond. Veroca wipes her mouth and addresses
RAQUEL, a uniformed nurse.
VEROCA (CONT'D)
Would you take her over to watch a
little TV, Raquel?
RAQUEL
Sure thing.
Raquel pushes Eunice's chair back inside the house.
ELIANA
Mom seems less irritated, doesn't she?
NALU
I think Joaquim does her good.
VEROCA
I don't know. Sometimes it seems like
she's completely adrift.
97.
98.
EXT. VEROCA'S HOUSE / LIVING ROOM - DAY
Her chair parked in the living room, Eunice's gaze is vacant.
She hears something, quiet and muffled: a voice. She looks
for the source and eventually locates a TV in front of her.
REPORTER
...twenty one years of military regime
in Brazil and the countless crimes
committed against those who opposed
it. The Commission heard over twelve
hundred witnesses, including State
officials and victims of the
dictatorship. The document reveals
systematic torture and murder that
victimized over twenty thousand people
and left hundreds more missing...
She focuses on the screen, which is showing the news. The
sound gradually becomes clearer. Eunice's expression changes.
REPORTER (CONT'D)
...The report identifies two
hundred and thirty locations where
these crimes were committed, such
as army barracks, as well as areas
used for disposing bodies, such as
Marambaia, in Rio de Janeiro...
Eunice seems transfixed by what she's seeing.
REPORTER (CONT'D)
...Some of these victims became
icons of resistance against the
military regime, like the
journalist Vladimir Herzog, the
student Stuart Angel...
The screen shows a photo of Herzog, followed by Stuart Angel.
REPORTER (CONT'D)
...and Congressman Rubens Paiva.
Rubens' picture fills the screen. Eunice's face lights up.
She points at the TV and tries to speak, her voice faint.
EUNICE
Look... look...
Distracted, Raquel doesn't notice. For a few seconds, Eunice
is connected to Rubens and the world. The photo disappears,
and the segment cuts back to the reporter.
98.
99.
REPORTER
...Paiva's body, like those of at
least two hundred others, has never
been found.
Eunice rests her arm on her lap and sinks back into her void.
Out on the porch, Marcelo has his eyes fixed on her.
EXT. VEROCA'S HOUSE / BACKYARD PATIO - DAY
Marcelo watches his mother through the window, moved by what
he's just seen. He's the lone, silent witness to the moment.
VEROCA (O.S.)
Raquel, can you bring Mom out,
please?
INT. VEROCA'S HOUSE / LIVING ROOM - DAY
Raquel maneuvers Eunice's wheelchair.
RAQUEL
We'll be right back, Miss Eunice.
Eunice, still lost in thought, is taken outside.
EXT. VEROCA'S HOUSE / BACKYARD PATIO - DAY
Despite all the family, Eunice looks around as if she were
being dropped into a world of unfamiliar sounds and images.
Her chair is parked. She turns to Eliana, who's sitting next
to her, looking the other way and gesticulating. She turns to
the other side and sees Marcelo, who points out ahead.
Confused, she turns back that way and sees Raquel pointing a
phone at them. The caretaker is moving her arms, making
gestures she can't decipher.
Only then does she realize that they're posing for a picture.
She immediately straightens up in her chair and breaks into a
shy grin. Touched, Marcelo calls out to everyone.
MARCELO
Let's do this folks. Smile!
A FLASH goes off, and we see the full photo, with all the
children and relatives gathered around Eunice, who's smiling.
FADE TO BLACK.
99.
