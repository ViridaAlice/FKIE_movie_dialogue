THE ROOM NEXT DOOR
1. A BOOKSTORE IN N.Y. DAY
There is a long line that leads to a little crowd around the
table where Ingrid Parker is signing copies of her latest
book. The bookstore owners had set aside an hour for the
signing, an hour that has now passed, but there are still
quite a few people in the line, the end of which stretches out
into the street. It’s cold, but the fans defy the bad weather
without complaining.
The book of autofiction is called On Sudden Deaths. A non-
binary fan is waiting for Ingrid to sign her book.
INGRID
(Handing the book to a fan) Thank you so
much. (To Bobbi) Hi. How are you?
FAN
Good. Thanks.
INGRID
Who should I make it out to?
FAN
Bobbi, with an “I”… In the prologue you
say you wrote this book in order to better
understand and accept death?
INGRID
Yes. It just seems unnatural. I have a
hard time understanding that something
that’s alive has to die.
The bookstore owner comes over and interrupts the
conversation:
3
OWNER
Ingrid…
The fan realizes that her time is up.
OWNER
We’ve fulfilled the hour (she looks at her
watch). I mean, in fact, we’ve gone over…
Ingrid looks at the line.
INGRID
There are still a lot of people waiting…
OWNER
Yes… We’ll do what you want…
2. BOOKSTORE. INT. DAY.
The first person in the line interrupts:
STELLA
Could you sign mine?
Ingrid looks at her and recognizes a distant friend, more or
less her age.
INGRID
Stella! I didn’t even see you…
She gets up and they exchange a kiss. She introduces her to
the owner.
INGRID
Why didn’t you come straight up?
4
STELLA
I was embarrassed. You draw a crowd! A lot
of young people and not just women…
INGRID
Stella, this is Anh… Anh, this is Stella…
(To the owner, Anh) I’m staying until I’ve
signed for everyone.
OWNER
Yes, I’ll make sure no one else joins the line.
Ingrid tells Stella to sit across from her, at the table where
she signs the copies, for a few moments. (Or they continue to
talk while standing.)
INGRID
I haven’t seen you in forever…!
STELLA
I’m living in Boston now. I’ve come to see
my son, and visit Martha in the hospital.
You know that she has cancer, right? It’s
a bad one.
INGRID
Our Martha? Martha Hunt?
STELLA
Yes. She’s at Manhattan Memorial Cancer
Center. I thought you’d have heard…
INGRID
No… To be honest, I haven’t seen her in
years. Martha, sick? I can’t imagine it…
STELLA
If you go see her, it’ll make her very
happy.
INGRID
5
Yes, yes, of course. Of course I will.
She gives her back the signed book.
STELLA
Congratulations…
Stella leaves and Ingrid carries on signing, now less focused.
The news about her sick friend has disconcerted her. A friend
to whom she’d been very close but hasn’t seen much recently.
She has a new reader in front of her, a girl of about 20/25,
who looks at her nervously. She hands her the book.
INGRID
Hi… So, who do I make it out to?
GIRL
Frances.
INGRID
(Amiable) Is that you?
GIRL
No, it’s my girlfriend. She really admires
you. Well, so do I.
INGRID
Thank you.
Ingrid starts to sign the book and gives her a very warm
smile.
GIRL
Could you write, “it won’t happen again”?
INGRID
Of course I can.
GIRL
6
Yes. Thank you… It won’t happen again.
INGRID
Of course. I hope not.
CUT TO:
3. BY THE RIVER. DAY.
Ingrid walks along the river on the way to the hospital.
4. FAÇADE OF A HOSPITAL/HOSPITAL LOBBY INT./EXT. DAY.
Ingrid walks through the main entrance. In the reception, she
says who she is going to see and confirms the room number.
INGRID
Hi. I’m here to see Martha Hunt. I think
she’s on the sixteenth floor…
RECEPTIONIST
One sec. (searching for Martha Hunt on the
computer) Yes. Room 1614. The elevators
are at the end of the hall on the left.
Ingrid walks down a long corridor that leads to a hallway.
5. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR.
We see her walk along a corridor. She passes a few nurses,
typical hospital atmosphere. She stops at a door that shows
the number she’s looking for. She knocks at the door and goes
in.
6. MARTHA’S ROOM. HOSPITAL. N.Y. CONT.
A conventional room, with some personal details of Martha’s,
and windows through which we see the architectural splendor of
7
Manhattan. Seen from outside, it gives the impression that the
room is floating. On one of the side tables, there are
flowers, next to some books. And the typical paraphernalia in
a cancer hospital.
The meeting is a great surprise for both of them, a very
pleasant surprise, although at first they feel a bit awkward,
a hospital isn’t the place where you want to meet your
friends. Neither of them was expecting it. (Both women are at
that undefined age between 50 and 60, which in 2024 means that
they’re probably closer to 60.) And they are absolutely
delighted about the meeting. (Martha is in bed, her eyes
closed. She hears Ingrid’s voice, it’s as if she were dreaming
about her.)
INGRID’S VOICE
Martha...
Martha opens her eyes.
MARTHA
Ingrid! What a surprise! How did you hear?
INGRID
I ran into Stella, she told me.
Despite the joy produced by this reunion, Martha looks very
weak, pale and thin as a rake. Ingrid tries to hide how
shocked she is at seeing at Martha like this.
INGRID
I’m so sorry, I didn’t even know you were
sick.
MARTHA
You with your work and me with mine…
8
Time’s gotten away from us.
As if she had just discovered this.
INGRID
It’s true. And I was living in Paris.
MARTHA
I’d heard that. I’ve been reading about
you. I know you’ve published another book,
and that it’s doing very well.
Ingrid makes a gesture to say no, as if her success were of no
importance.
INGRID
How are you? I’m sure you’re tired of
explaining it to everyone.
MARTHA
It’s cervical cancer. Stage 3. It isn’t
operable, but they’re treating me and it
looks like I’m not going to die quite yet.
I’ve become a guinea pig for an
experimental treatment. The results are
much better than what the doctors were
expecting.
INGRID
That’s great! You seem in good spirits.
MARTHA
(Smiling) Well, I swing between euphoria
and depression.
INGRID
I’m so sorry.
MARTHA
It’s normal. The doctors warned me… to
9
have highs and lows…
Martha grows more cheerful and Ingrid relaxes. Perhaps she
helps her sit in an armchair.
MARTHA(CONT’D)
(Ironic) It might sound absurd, but after
all the accepting and preparing to face
the end, survival feels almost
disappointing.
INGRID
Don’t say that!
MARTHA
I was prepared to leave. In fact, when I
got the initial diagnosis, I didn’t want
any treatment.
Martha has already made her decision. Ingrid cannot suspect it
and will only find out a few weeks later.
INGRID
I’m glad you changed your mind. (Sincere)
Just the thought… you would… and me not
knowing…
MARTHA
I realized I really didn’t want to abandon
the party just yet, but I truly had gotten
used to the idea…
INGRID
I suppose it’s good to get used to the
idea… but without giving up… You’ve been
through quite a few wars, remember?
MARTHA
I live with them every day! (Changing her
10
tone. Smiling, grateful) I’m so happy
you’re here, Ingrid! I’ve almost called
you a thousand times.
INGRID
Me too. It’s ridiculous that we haven’t
seen each other for so long. I promise to
visit you until you get bored with me.
CUT TO:
7. ON ANOTHER VISIT. HOSPITAL. N.Y. INT. DAY.
The room hasn’t changed much, perhaps Ingrid is dressed
differently and the flowers are different too. Also it is
morning, the light is different. They are still talking as if
it were the continuation of the previous conversation. They’re
also sitting in a different way. We follow the conversation by
a direct cut.
INGRID
Your daughter knows, I guess.
MARTHA
Yes. When I’d first made up my mind to
forgo any treatment, I told her and she
just said: It’s your choice. Period. As if
it were something trivial, something that
had nothing to do with her.
Her joking tone at the start becomes harder and gives way to
maternal bitterness. Ingrid listens to her, upset.
INGRID
How are you two getting along?
MARTHA
11
Same as ever. We’re barely in touch.
INGRID
What does she do?
MARTHA
She’s doing well. She is an agent for
classical musicians.
Ingrid can’t think of what to say, but she’s a woman who knows
how to listen and accompany someone with her silence.
MARTHA
It might sound horrible, but I don’t feel
like she’s my daughter. I’ve fantasized
frequently about her being swapped at
birth.
INGRID
What! What are you talking about? She
looks just like you. She has your face.
Martha’s expression has totally changed. At the start, she was
euphoric and now she seems depressed. Highs and lows. Euphoria
and depression.
MARTHA
(Not understanding her daughter) I never
interested her as a mother.
INGRID
Why not?
Martha shakes her head. It’s hard to answer that question in a
few words.
MARTHA
I was a teenager when I had her. I didn’t
12
know what to do with a baby. And when we
started working on Paper Magazine,
remember?… we practically lived at night.
You remember? In New York, in the 80s,
anything important happened at night. And
then I went to work as a war reporter,
traveling constantly… that didn’t help. My
work totally took over. I was never what a
mother is supposed to be. But Michelle
hated me long before I was away so much. I
remember feeling her resentment, even when
she was still a little girl… she made
herself very clear. She couldn’t bear not
having a father. She saw other girls had
fathers and she wanted to know about hers.
At first, I told her that I didn’t know
who he was, but that kind of made things
worse…
8. FLASHBACK. INT. BOWLING ALLEY. EARLY 70S.
Martha is an adolescent of about fifteen or sixteen. She is
bowling with a group of friends whose ages range from 16 to
20. She has a special affinity with Fred, a boy of 20,
spectacularly handsome. Fred bowls a strike, causing a
tremendous uproar. Martha gives him a kiss on the mouth as a
reward and they carry on embracing.
As a background to these images, we hear Martha’s voice off
screen.
MARTHA (OFF)
I was lying to her. Of course I knew who
he was…
13
MARTHA (OFF)
His name was Fred. We dated for a few
months before he was drafted and he went
to fight, towards the end of Vietnam.
9. FLASHBACK. ADOLESCENT MARTHA’S HOUSE. EXT. AND INT. DAY.
Adolescent Martha heads for the door and opens it while we
hear the voice over of Martha Adult:
MARTHA (OFF)
When he came back a year later, he was…
somebody different… he was a broken toy…
Young Martha sees Fred, with very short hair, some scars on
his face, which is also burnt by the sun. There’s a glitter of
panic in his eyes and a traumatized expression on his face.
YOUNG MARTHA
Fred! What happened!
He says nothing. We see Fred standing in the doorway, very
different than when we last saw him at the bowling alley.
CUT TO:
10. MARTHA'S LIVING ROOM. INT. DAY.
They are sitting on the sofa in the living room and Young
Martha tries to cheer Fred up.
YOUNG MARTHA(CONT’D)
Hey… Easy, I’m here… it’s all over now,
Fred. You’re back home.
14
Fred shakes his head. Panic has left its mark on his face.
FRED
But it’s not over for me, the war is still
inside my head… I can’t get free of it… I
hallucinate all the time…
Martha doesn’t know what to say. She strokes his cheek. Fred
wants to be honest, he’s obsessed with it. He’s in the midst
of the initial stages of an existential crisis.
FRED
I was high practically every day… and… I
don’t know what I’m going to do with my
life, Martha… I’m not staying here.
ADULT MARTHA (V.O.)
So I freed him from any commitments.
YOUNG MARTHA
It’s alright… Feel free to do what you
like… Think about what’s best for you.
As a gesture of gratitude Fred asks if he can kiss her.
FRED
Can I kiss you?
Martha looks at him, and he looks at her and seems to find an
instant of solace in her eyes. They kiss. Fred’s face
instantly relaxes with Martha’s tenderness. The initial kiss
leads them to continued kissing and touching each other and
loosening their clothes.
The young couple makes love.
15
CUT TO:
11. HOSPITAL. MARTHA’S ROOM. INT. AFTERNOON
MARTHA
He told me that they’d spent the war high
as a kite, on acid and weed. I think he
just got lost in a bad trip.
INGRID
Does Michelle know this?
MARTHA
She started asking about her father as
soon as she could talk, but it’s not
something I could explain to a child,
right? By puberty, she had already carved
out quite an abyss between us. It came to
define her adolescence. But, by then, I
was no longer there, I was in New York
with you, living my life.
Ingrid is the perfect woman to listen to her friend’s drama.
12. FLASHBACK. DINER. INT. DAY (SIX WEEKS LATER)
We hear the start of Martha’s voiceover while a waitress
serves Martha’s teenage version and Fred.
The shot would begin with the waitress at the bar, placing the
order on the tray. The camera follows her until she arrives at
the place where the young couple are sitting.
MARTHA (OFF)
I arranged to meet Fred one evening to
16
tell him about the situation.
In a half-full diner, Martha talks to Fred, he is still
clearly disturbed. Maybe Fred is smoking a cigarette. The
waitress arrives and leaves the order on the table, a milk
shake for her and cheesecake for him.
During the action, Fred says:
YOUNG MARTHA
Thank you.
FRED
Thanks… So, I took a first aid course, and
because I’m a war veteran, they hired me
at a hospital down in San Diego. That’s
good news… right?
Martha takes a sip of her milkshake, as if to gather her
strength.
YOUNG MARTHA
I have some news for you too. I’m
pregnant.
FRED
What?
YOUNG MARTHA
I’m pregnant.
FRED
(Taken aback, he wasn’t expecting this at
all) Pregnant?!
YOUNG MARTHA
Yes.
FRED
But I… I was planning to move to San Diego
next week…
YOUNG MARTHA
I know…
17
FRED
(Confused) What do we do?
After thinking about it for a moment:
YOUNG MARTHA
I don’t know, but don’t worry, do what you
have to do. I just thought you should
know.
FRED
I don’t know… I feel kind of responsible
now…
Martha thinks, even if she doesn’t say it… “no shit”. Even
though she’s three years younger, Martha quickly realizes that
she can’t count on Fred for anything and makes the decision to
proceed without his help.
YOUNG MARTHA
Yeah… but you’ve got enough things to
worry about, I don’t want to add anything…
so…
FRED
You’re very generous. And what are you
going to do?
YOUNG MARTHA
I don’t know yet. But whatever I do, my
parents will support me, I’m not alone.
(They should use the kind of expressions that young people
from that time would use.)
13. IN THE HOSPITAL. MARTHA AND INGRID.
18
INGRID
I don’t think working in a hospital was
the best thing for such a damaged person.
It’s the closest thing to war. What he
needed was therapy and rehab.
MARTHA
That would have been more sensible, but he
wanted to be useful. To ease his
conscience… He believed that helping
people who were between life and death was
the best chance to get back any peace. I
could only free him of any responsibility.
He left before Michelle was born, he never
knew her. He didn’t even call once to ask
about her.
INGRID
When did you tell her?
MARTHA
She was about twelve. She wanted to know
where he was living, but I didn’t know
anymore. She was so insistent that I
tracked down an old friend of his from
high school, who told me that Fred had
gotten married and had recently died. I
asked him for his wife’s number and I
called her. I wanted to know what had
happened.
The previous monologue is seen in the hospital, what comes now
is seen as a flashback.
14. FLASHBACK A ROAD THAT RUNS THROUGH A CROP FIELD. 1985.
INT. DAY.
19
(Fred is played by the same actor at twenty, when he goes off
to Vietnam, as at thirty-two.)
MARTHA (OFF)
She said that they were coming home… after
a trip.
We are directly on the road and then in the car.
A road in the middle of nowhere.
A car drives down a country road. Inside the vehicle, Fred and
his wife talk about domestic issues.
Fred looks out to the right and discovers a rising column of
smoke. (They are about a quarter mile from the burning house).
FRED
Isn’t that smoke?
The wife looks in the direction of Fred’s gaze.
WIFE
Yes. Something’s on fire…
CUT TO:
15. FLASHBACK A DIRT ROAD THAT RUNS FROM THE MAIN ROAD TO THE
HOUSE. 1985. INT./EXT. DAY.
A road in the middle of the countryside. Another car is
traveling in the opposite direction towards them, but it
doesn’t stop.
20
When Fred’s car is closer they can see that it’s a wood house
with the roof in flames.
There’s a dirt road that joins the house with the road. They
pull up into the dirt road. They see the house on fire.
FRED
(Remembering the fires during the war)
There’s a house on fire!
WIFE
We should call the fire department.
FRED
Stop the car!
The wife stops the car and Fred starts to quickly get out. His
facial expression has changed, especially the eyes, that
reveal a profound trauma. Through the car window we see the
house in flames.
WIFE
What are you doing?
FRED
I’m going to take a look.
WIFE
No, that’s crazy. Let’s call somebody.
The Wife gets out of the car.
FRED
There might be someone inside.
WIFE
Fred! Stop. Stop! This is crazy!
She grabs him by the arm, and manages to stop her husband.
21
WIFE
(Distraught) Fred, don’t go in! It’s
dangerous. (She grabs him) Look at me!
Look at me! Let’s go find a gas station
and call the fire department.
Fred stops and points his right finger at his ear.
FRED
(Eyes bulging, traumatized by the fires in
Vietnam.) Don’t you hear the screams?!
The wife understands exactly what’s happening to her husband.
Her rejection is like a command, forbidding him to hear
anything.
WIFE
No! I don’t hear anything!
Fred pulls away from his wife. She tries to follow him, but
stumbles on something and loses her balance and falls on the
grass (like in the famous painting by Andrew Wyeth,
Christina’s World). She watches as her husband goes over to
the house, and starts to disappear into the smoke.
WIFE(CONT’D)
(Shouting to him) Fred, please! Don’t go
in there!
Fred looks back at her.
FRED
(His eyes still bulging) Don’t you hear
22
the screams! There’s someone inside crying
for help!
She looks in horror at the burning house and at her husband,
like someone possessed, going in there. She shouts:
WIFE
Fred!
She gets up and tries to follow him while he continues running
towards the house and disappears into the smoke.
CUT TO:
16. THE SAME MEADOW NEXT TO THE ROAD
The woman sees a fire truck arrive, she runs over to them.
While the firemen go up to the house and rapidly start
extinguishing the flames, Fred’s wife goes over to the man who
seems to be the fire chief and who is giving orders to the
others.
WIFE
Sir, sir please, help me! Sir, sir!
FIRE CHIEF
Let’s go! Two lines. On the back. Ladder
up!
WIFE
Sir, please! My husband’s inside!
The fire chief looks at her, not fully understanding her. He
continues giving orders to his men.
FIRE CHIEF
23
Give me a two and a half on the back,
Johnny! (To her) Yes, ma’am… (To Johnny)
Johnny!
WIFE
Sir, my husband’s inside! Inside.
FIRE CHIEF
What’s that?
WIFE
(Distressed, tearful) My husband’s inside…
He thought he heard voices crying for
help.
FIRE CHIEF
Give me two lines on the back side, guys.
Okay.
WIFE
And he went into the house trying to save
whomever was trapped by the fire.
The fire chief thinks the explanation is strange and he goes
over to the house.
FIRE CHIEF
Okay… okay. Get back in your car, do not
go over there… Please, ma’am. Is there
someone else?
WIFE
Okay… No, I don’t know…
FIRE CHIEF
Ladder up, guys! Ladder up! There’s a
civilian inside! Get back in your car…
CUT TO:
17. THE SAME MEADOW NEXT TO THE ROAD. TIME HAS PASSED.
24
The fire is almost out. The firemen bring out Fred’s body,
which is lying covered on a gurney. The wife is among them,
she can’t stop looking at the charred remains of her husband,
although she can’t see them.
FIRE CHIEF
I’m sorry. There was nothing we could do.
The wife looks at him, distressed, perhaps sobbing.
FIRE CHIEF(CONT’D)
He didn’t get to the second floor, he must
have passed out from the smoke and the
flames.
There is an ambulance parked there. There’s also some police
cordoning off the site. The wife, the fire chief and some of
the firemen who push a gurney with Fred’s body, all make their
way over to it.
WIFE
(To the fire chief) And the other bodies?
FIRE CHIEF
There was no one else. The house has been
abandoned for a long time. There was only
your husband.
WIFE
But he… he told me that he heard screams
for help…
FIRE CHIEF
Impossible. There was no one else…
WIFE
(Upset, she admits it) It’s true. I didn’t
hear the screams either. I tried to stop
25
him from going in, but he insisted. He
insisted! But it was impossible.
FIRE CHIEF
There was nobody. I’m sorry. He was very
brave. (To another fireman) Tim, can we
get someone to accompany her home?
WIFE
I want to go with him. I’ll follow you.
FIRE CHIEF
Tim, you drive the lady’s car, and follow
us back to the station.
18. HOSPITAL ROOM. MARTHA AND INGRID. CONT.
INGRID
Did you tell Michelle all of this?
MARTHA
Yes. I had to give her all the details. I
even gave her her father’s wife’s phone
number.
19. HOSPITAL ROOM. CONT.
The two women have changed their positions, perhaps now
sitting facing each other across a table.
INGRID
You know what… Let’s get you back to bed.
You’re tired… we can talk later. You don’t
have to tell me now.
She helps her to lie down. Meanwhile Martha continues talking,
exhausted. She needs to tell Ingrid.
26
MARTHA
No, I have to tell you this. One day, I
got a call from Fred’s wife. She asked me
for my address, she wanted to send me
something…
She breaks off to get her breath back. Ingrid looks at her
inquisitively.
MARTHA(CONT’D)
Shortly after, I received a note and a
letter that the wife received from
Michelle. Michelle introduced herself and
told her that it was her, Fred’s daughter,
who was in the burning house. “It was me
he tried to save. It was for me for whom
he died”, Michelle wrote to her.
Ingrid looks at her, disconcerted, after a silence in which
Martha dries her damp nose.
INGRID
That’s insane!
MARTHA
Yes.
20. INGRID’S HOUSE. LOWER EAST SIDE. INT. DAY
Ingrid has just moved in. There are cardboard boxes
everywhere. What we see of the house looks a little old,
rather than lived in, but with charm. There is an occasional
new piece of wooden furniture that isn’t out of place beside
the rest. It’s a very particular apartment with a very
pleasant atmosphere. Ingrid has a few framed pictures leaning
27
against a wall. Standing out among them is one of the iconic
covers of the magazine Paper.
Ingrid is opening one of the boxes when her cell phone rings.
It’s Martha.
INGRID
Hi!
MARTHA
It’s Martha, the nuisance…
INGRID
You’re not a nuisance. How are you
feeling?
MARTHA
Fine, I’m at home.
21. BEDROOM. MARTHA’S HOUSE. WASHINGTON SQUARE. INT. DAY
Martha is spending a few days in her home, very different from
Ingrid’s, but with some elements in common. They both worked
on the same magazine in the mid-80s and each one has a framed
iconic front cover of the magazine. Martha keeps items of
popular craftwork from her many journeys around the world. The
decorating style is a mixture of sophistication and bohemia,
but more baroque than Ingrid’s.
MARTHA
The hospital has given me a few days off
between treatments, so I’m at home.
Martha lives in one of the buildings that surround Washington
Square, high up, around the 20th floor. All of Manhattan comes
through the windows.
28
MARTHA(CONT’D)
I’d love for you to come over.
INGRID
Well, you’ve got me in the middle of
moving.
MARTHA
Oh, then you’re really busy, right?
INGRID
Well, you know what moving is like, but if
you’re feeling lonely I could stop by… We
can take a walk through the park.
MARTHA
I might not be quite up for a walk…
INGRID
(Determined) Okay… you know what… let me
finish what I’m doing and come over.
MARTHA
Thank you, sweetheart, but don’t feel
obliged.
22. FAÇADE BUILDING WASHINGTON SQUARE. MARTHA’S APARTMENT.
N.Y. EXT. DAY
Ingrid arrives in a taxi. She rings the bell. The door opens
and she goes inside. It’s a building with personality, sober
and with good taste.
23. BUILDING WASHINGTON SQUARE. MARTHA’S APARTMENT. INT. DAY
Ingrid goes along the corridor, or up some stairs, looking at
the different doors. She’s carrying a bunch of flowers and a
paper bag containing some books. Before she can ring the bell,
Martha appears at one of them. They kiss.
29
24. MARTHA’S APARTMENT. WASHINGTON SQUARE. KITCHEN/LIVING
ROOM. INT. DAY
Ingrid looks with curiosity at the interior of the apartment
and makes some comments. She recognizes some of the objects
that hark back to a time when they saw each other daily.
Ingrid gives Martha some flowers. Martha gratefully takes
them.
INGRID
(Referring to the flowers) These are for
you…
MARTHA
You’re a darling. Thank you.
INGRID
And I brought you a couple of books.
Ingrid follows Martha into the kitchen, where Martha arranges
the flowers in a vase.
MARTHA
Thank you… You want something to drink?
INGRID
I’d love some tea. Herbal tea if you have
it.
On the kitchen worktop there are two large fruit bowls with a
selection of fruits. The color of the kitchen is very pop, but
it isn’t jarring.
MARTHA
Sure. (Referring to the flowers) I’ll put
these in a vase. All this is for you. You
30
have to eat it all.
INGRID
(Laughing) Wow, I’ll do my best. I love
fruit.
Martha pours some water for the flowers.
The apartment is on the corner of the building, the light
comes through all the windows and they can see the different
Manhattan skylines. Splendor.
CUT TO:
25. MARTHA’S APARTMENT. WASHINGTON SQUARE. N.Y. INT. DAY
The women are sitting in the living room of the apartment,
having tea, coffee or beer. Above them, in the center of the
wall, hangs a photo of widows in Georgia, in black and white.
MARTHA
Are you working on something new?
The books she has brought as a gift are on the table next to
the drink. One is about the painter Dora Carrington.
INGRID
Actually, I am! I’m doing research on the
painter Dora Carrington and her intense
devotion to the writer Lytton Strachey.
Here he is. (Ingrid takes the books from
the table) Strachey was gay, so she
married the straight man that he was
infatuated with. It’ll be the story of the
trio. It isn’t groundbreaking, but I want
to see where it takes me. Here you go…
31
look at this…
Ingrid takes the book about Dora Carrington’s work and the two
of them glance through it, pausing at some of the paintings,
the most representative ones.
INGRID
Her work isn’t very well known.
Unfortunately for her, there was a more
famous painter, the surrealist Leonora
Carrington, whose name was obviously very
similar to hers. Dora was better known for
this deranged love story with Strachey.
She devoted seventeen years of her life to
him. It’ll be a fictionalized biography,
so I’ll make some stuff up too.
MARTHA
I’ve never been able to allow myself that…
INGRID
Well, I can imagine, you’re a war
reporter.
MARTHA
You can’t show your emotions. You have to
block them out so you could do your job
and stay present, in the middle of
whatever hell.
INGRID
The mere idea of it gives me chills.
MARTHA
You have to separate the emotional from
the professional.
INGRID
Maybe I should write about you and not
Carrington.
32
MARTHA
I don’t think you’d enjoy writing about
illnesses and treatments.
INGRID
(Joking) You’re wrong.
MARTHA
I’m just a journalist, addicted to wars
and adrenaline.
INGRID
And you think that’s nothing?
CUT TO:
26. MARTHA’S APARTMENT. WASHINGTON SQUARE. INT. DAY. LATER,
ALMOST DUSK.
The same situation, but another, lighter mood.
MARTHA
It wasn’t all tragedy, life went on. There
was one report where I added a bit of
fiction…
INGRID
Oh, really?!
MARTHA
Naturally, I never published it.
Ingrid looks at her intently. She supposes that Martha’s going
to tell her about it. (This is another set piece.)
27. MARTHA’S APARTMENT. N.Y. INT. DAY. ALMOST DUSK.
MARTHA
It was during the war in Iraq. The last
33
day, before leaving Baghdad.
Ingrid listens to her, very interested.
28. FLASHBACK. BAGHDAD. CAR / CARMELITES´ MISSION
Flashback that accompanies and mingles with Martha’s
voiceover. Baghdad, Carmelite mission, interior of a plane,
etc.
If I could, I’d shoot a point of view from inside a car in
which Martha, twenty years younger, is traveling with a
photographer who works with her. The images show us a
devastated city. Martha is driving. They arrive in an alley.
What used to be Al Thawra St. and is now Al Masref St. A man
quickly crosses the frame with a mattress on his shoulders. A
couple of men drag a heavy object wrapped in a blanket.
MARTHA
Are you sure this is the right way?
PHOTOGRAPHER
Yes. Make a left here, in this alley.
There is an explosion in the distance.
MARTHA
Let's make this brief.
PHOTOGRAPHER
Sure.
They arrive at a place.
PHOTOGRAPHER
Here, stop here.
34
Martha stops the vehicle. The Mission wall is full of impacts
of bullets and shells. The few windows facing the outside are
covered with large sand bags. There are two Carmelite priests
placing sandbags to protect the entrance to the mission.
From her point of view, she sees how the photographer walks
quickly and interrupts the two priests who have their backs
turned.
A few meters from them and carrying a camera, Martin, the
photographer, calls out to one of them.
PHOTOGRAPHER
Bernardo!
The priest turns and sees his friend.
BERNARDO
(In Spanish) Mira quien está aquí. Martin,
what are you doing here, in Baghdad!?
The other priest turns to look at them and sees how the two
men embrace. When they separate Bernardo presents Paco.
PHOTOGRAPHER
You really look great, Bernardo!
BERNARDO
Sorry… Martin, Paco. (They shake hands)
(To Martin) He’s a Carmelite, like me.
Both men are excited to see each other as Paco looks on.
35
From inside the car, Martha takes out of her purse a block of
notes and a pen and begins writing what she sees.
Martha immediately joins the group. She carries the block of
notes, in which she jots down notes by hand.
The Spanish Carmelites’ mission is half destroyed. The walls;
full of holes from the impact of bullets, a violent image that
contrasts with the calm of the photographer, the Carmelites
and Martha herself. When she joins the group, the photographer
introduces her to the Carmelites. One of them, Bernardo, does
all the talking, Paco seems timid and says he doesn’t speak
English.
PHOTOGRAPHER
Martha, let me present Bernardo and Paco.
Martha is a brilliant journalist for the
New York Times. They are the Carmelites I
was telling you about.
MARTHA
It’s a pleasure to meet you both. Are you
intending to stay in Baghdad?
BERNARDO
Yes. Here we are.
MARTHA
But you’re alone. All the NGOs and the Red
Cross have left already.
BERNARDO
Yes. I know.
MARTHA
But the situation is out of control and
very dangerous.
BERNARDO
You’re here as well…
36
MARTHA
We’re just passing through. We’re leaving
as soon as we’re finished talking to you.
Paco, the Carmelite who doesn’t speak, as well as being
uncomfortable about the interview, is scared.
BERNARDO
We can’t let them down now, this is when
the people need us most.
Martha nods in acquiescence.
MARTHA
That’s true, but still extremely
dangerous. But then you know that.
An explosion sounds in the distance.
BERNARDO
We can’t let them down now, señora.
PHOTOGRAPHER
Do you mind if we take a photo of you and
of how the mission has been left?
The Carmelite Paco says in Spanish that he’d rather not
appear.
PACO
Yo prefiero no salir.
BERNARDO
(To the photographer) You can photograph
the mission, and me, but he doesn’t want
to risk his family in Spain seeing him.
37
They’d worry.
Martha nods her head that she understands.
MARTHA
Yes, of course. I totally understand. If
we could just get one of you that would be
great.
Bernardo poses with the mission and the photographer goes to
take his photo.
PHOTOGRAPHER
(Gesturing for him to come closer) Could
you come just a tiny bit closer so I can
get the impacts?
When he finishes taking photos, he walks over to show his
friend the pictures he’s just taken. Martha heads for the car.
PHOTOGRAPHER
(To Bernardo) How long has it been since
we last saw each other?
BERNARDO
Five years?
PHOTOGRAPHER
Five years… Do you remember Liberia?
BERNARDO
(Smiling) How could I forget!
PHOTOGRAPHER
I have some photos of you that we didn’t
publish. If you give me an address, I can
send them to you. Maybe to the embassy.
BERNARDO
38
(Smiling) No, you keep them. That way I’ll
keep you company.
The photographer and the Carmelite hug and say goodbye.
BERNARDO
Goodbye, Martin.
PHOTOGRAPHER
It is great to see you. Take care. Stay
safe.
We hear the distant sound of explosions, the war continues.
CUT TO:
29. FLASHBACK. INSIDE THE PLANE
Martha and the photographer, a charming and carefree man,
looking like a middle aged old sea dog, are sitting together
and having a relaxed drink, after all the emotions and out of
pure weariness.
Martha takes some notes in her notebook.
MARTHA
How do you know the Carmelite?
PHOTOGRAPHER
We met in Sierra Leone. We became lovers
there.
Without looking directly at him she writes in her
notebook.
MARTHA
39
Oh, really?
PHOTOGRAPHER
After that, we met more times. Always in
places that were at war.
MARTHA
And you had sex?
PHOTOGRAPHER
Of course. Bernardo never renounced
physical pleasure. He was always in the
most conflictive places and… I think that
sex was his best shield… I’m sure the
Carmelite is his partner.
MARTHA
You think so?
PHOTOGRAPHER
Definitely. That’s the only way you can
stay in Baghdad and not be afraid of the
war.
MARTHA
What a wonderful story.
She tries to write this last part, but the
photographer warns her.
PHOTOGRAPHER
Don’t you dare write it.
Martha immediately stops writing, but there’s
something childish in her gesture.
MARTHA
No, of course not. But what about sin for
him? Don’t they feel guilty? After all,
they’re Catholic.
PHOTOGRAPHER
He never talked about it. With all the
40
horrors you see in war, feeling guilty
about having sex doesn’t really carry much
weight, you simply get used to it.
MARTHA
I know that.
30. MARTHA APARTMENT WASHINGTON SQUARE. EXT. DAY.
We take our time as the two friends come out of Martha’s
building and down the steps, accompanied by a delicate musical
score that takes us away from Iraq and brings us back to the
two friends.
Ingrid listens, fascinated, to the story of the Carmelites.
MARTHA
I wrote their story… their love story, as
I imagined it, but it stayed on my
computer.
31. JEFFERSON MARKET GARDEN. EXT. DAY.
There’s the usual atmosphere in the gardens. The two friends
sit on a bench, looking around and taking in their
surroundings.
MARTHA
So you’re going to write about Dora
Carrington’s insane love.
INGRID
Mhmm… and her connection to Virginia
Woolf, whom Strachey also pursued
romantically.
41
MARTHA
What a group! I so admire their freedom.
INGRID
Strachey died of stomach cancer eighteen
years after meeting Dora. And Dora
survived him by barely two months before
she shot herself in the stomach.
Martha is shocked by Carrington shooting herself in the
stomach.
INGRID
She was only thirty-eight…
MARTHA
(Pensive) I’m struck by the symmetry of
that kind of gesture… His stomach cancer
and her shooting herself in the stomach.
INGRID
I know… it struck me too.
MARTHA
Maybe Virginia saw a kind of warning in
Carrington’s death, a mirror that
reflected her.
INGRID
Yes. It's as if the two of them, no matter
what happened, were fated.
Martha feels a part of that condemnation. Ingrid didn’t
consider the effect of her words, she realizes now. (Martha
thinks about her own decision to choose Euthanasia and her
semblance darkens).
MARTHA
Do you think I’m fated too?
42
INGRID
No! Of course not! I’ve never known anyone
more alive than you.
Martha is indeed remembering her old vitality.
MARTHA
Next week I’m starting a new experimental
immunotherapy treatment. They’ve already
tried it and it seems to work well with
cases of cervical cancer.
INGRID
Well that’s great news! Let me know when I
can come and visit you, okay?
MARTHA
I will…(Lightening the mood) Talking of
symmetry… do you remember Damian
Cunningham?
INGRID
How could I forget?! I inherited him from
you.
MARTHA
The shared lover. I have to say, I felt
terrible when you got together after I’d
been with him.
INGRID
(Surprised) Okay, we didn’t share him
exactly, because you had already broken up
and you were out of the country.
MARTHA
I would never go back with him! And to
tell the truth I was never faithful to
him. But he was a passionate, and
enthusiastic lover… And I hope he was for
43
you too.
INGRID
I had no complaints.
Ingrid smiles. She’s amused that in these circumstances her
friend is talking about sex and Damian.
SEVERAL WEEKS LATER.
32. FAÇADE OF CANCER HOSPITAL. EXT. DAY
Ingrid comes into the building. She passes visitors and
hospital staff.
33. HOSPITAL. INT. DAY. CORRIDOR
She walks down a long corridor. She knocks on a door and goes
in. She has a bag full of things.
34. HOSPITAL. INT. DAY. MARTHA’S ROOM
Martha doesn’t have to say anything. Her eyes glitter with
despair and impotence. She is sitting at the top of the bed.
They kiss.
INGRID
Hi. What is it?
Furious with herself, as if it were her fault.
MARTHA
It hasn’t worked, I’ve got metastases in
my liver and in my bones.
INGRID
44
Oh, Martha!
MARTHA
I should have followed my first instinct
and not put myself through this torture.
The vomiting, the diarrhea, the fatigue…
just to end up like this… I should never
have given in to false hopes.
INGRID
(Scared) What does the doctor say? Tell
me.
MARTHA
That I could live for months, maybe a
year… He wants me to continue the
treatment even though it looks hopeless!
INGRID
Maybe it will work this time!
Ingrid tries to cheer her up: doctors can be wrong too. She
just thinks it, she knows it would be to state the obvious.
Martha realizes that her friend is trying to console her, but
she can’t find the words, and she lowers her tone.
MARTHA
I don’t want to wallow in self-pity. I’m
also no stoic, I’m sorry. I don’t want to
go through excruciating pain. You can’t be
self-possessed if you’re in agony, you
can’t think straight, you can think of
only one thing… the fucking cancer.
In these indignant monologues, Martha goes through different
moods. At times, it’s fury that gives her strength; at times,
she goes to pieces and only murmurs. Ingrid is terrified, she
gives her a glass of water. Martha drinks. Ingrid takes her
45
hands to console her. She manages to calm her a little,
Martha’s tone sounds less hysterical, sadder, on the verge of
tears, for lack of strength.
MARTHA
(Serious) I’ve always taken care of my
health, and now I regret it. (Impotent,
self-aggressive) The doctor says I have a
strong heart. (Asking her as if to find a
response) What does that mean? That my
body will keep fighting, that I’ll have to
suffer and suffer up to my last breath?
Ingrid hugs her tightly.
INGRID
(Terrified) I don’t know… I don’t know how
to help you… I’m so sorry.
MARTHA
(Exhausted) I think I deserve a good
death… or at least one without convulsions
in my last moments. Going out with a
little bit of dignity, clean and dry. But
I know I’m asking too much…
CUT TO:
35. HOSPITAL. INT. DAY.
In the previous scene I’m going to try to get Martha up and
get her over to the window and Ingrid will follow her, all of
this driven by the impotence and desperation Martha feels. So
that maybe when the nurse comes in, Martha is still standing
46
and Ingrid sitting in the chair, incapable of consoling her
friend.
NURSE
What are you doing up, Martha?
MARTHA
(Slightly defiant, or simply informing the
nurse how she feels, even if she
exaggerates it a little bit) I’m fucking
over this…
INGRID
(To the nurse) Can you help her?
NURSE
(She says it gently to both of them) Of
course. Let’s get you back in bed.
Martha gets back in bed. The nurse connects her to the IV
drip.
NURSE
Here, this will help you.
MARTHA
(Extending her arm) Bring it on.
The nurse injects morphine in the drip.
MARTHA
(To Ingrid, as if the nurse didn’t exist)
I’ll end up turning into a junkie. I am
one already, I guess.
INGRID
It’s okay, really.
47
The nurse is used to this, she doesn’t react to Martha’s
words, and she injects her with an opiate. It has an immediate
effect on the patient, she grows drowsy, watched by Ingrid.
CUT TO:
36. THE WEATHER.
Martha opens her eyes, she speaks a little drowsily. The light
in the room has changed.
MARTHA
Are you still here?
INGRID
Yes.
Ingrid is looking at her phone. She stops doing this when
Martha speaks to her. Perhaps Ingrid gives her a glass of
water. Or she asks her about supper, but Martha doesn’t want
to hear about eating.
INGRID
Should I tell ask them to bring your
dinner? Are you hungry?
MARTHA
No. Ingrid, do you think I need to say
goodbye to my closest friends?
INGRID
I think you should do whatever you want to
do.
MARTHA
I just want some peace and quiet.
INGRID
(Finding the courage to ask Martha:) Have
48
you thought about how you want to spend
the time? And where? Is there some place
you’d like to go?
Martha points to the window behind Ingrid. She says it as if
it were a hallucination caused by the morphine.
MARTHA(CONT’D)
Look.
Outside, it has started to snow. Ingrid turns to the window.
The sun is going down and the snow has been tinted a sunset
pink. (Is it winter or is it due to the climate change? It
would have to be mentioned.) Martha seems to levitate at the
beauty of this image.
MARTHA(CONT’D)
Pink snowflakes. There had to be something
good about climate change. Well, I’ve
lived to see that. Do you remember the end
of Joyce’s The Dead?
INGRID
(Emotional) Vaguely.
Slowly, to the rhythm of the falling snowflakes.
MARTHA
“The snow is falling, falling on the
lonely churchyard, falling faintly through
the universe and faintly falling, like the
descent of their last end, upon all the
living and the dead…”
49
Ingrid, with her back to her, can’t hold back her tears. She
takes out a Kleenex and dries them. Martha looks at her while
she does it and feels an immense gratitude towards her friend.
Ingrid turns back to her, more or less composed again, her
eyes still glittering.
INGRID
It’s late… I should be going…
MARTHA
Thank you.
INGRID
I’ll see you tomorrow.
The sun hides and the light disappears from the room. They
give each other a kiss.
FADE TO BLACK
37. LINCOLN CENTER FOYER. INT. DAY
Martha looks better than in the hospital, but at times when
she speaks, she is left breathless. There are people walking
in the wide foyer going to one of its rooms, to see a film or
listen to a talk. People of all ages, very New Yorker style.
The foyer is all glassed in. From inside we can see Columbus
Circle and the nearby skyscrapers. In the street that leads to
one side of the Lincoln Center there is a multitude of
paintings that fill the whole space.
Martha and Ingrid are sitting together at a little table
drinking something. Behind them there is a bar, all of wood,
reddish like the rest of the wall.
50
Ingrid looks at her watch. (Perhaps they have a program sheet,
something that gives the programming.)
INGRID
There’s still a half an hour before the
movie starts. Shall we go in and get our
seats before the rush?
MARTHA
No… I want to talk to you about something.
INGRID
Okay.
Martha speaks in a serious, calm tone, not melodramatic, or
solemn, rather with a pragmatic, determined expression,
stating a fact.
MARTHA
I will not go out in mortifying anguish.
Ingrid looks at her, she’d supposed it already, but she is
surprised that she says it at that moment.
MARTHA(CONT’D)
I’ve gotten hold of a euthanasia pill.
Don’t ask me how, on the Dark Web you can
get hold of/find almost anything. I also
have an abundance of opioids for the
moments of pain… and don’t look at me like
that… I’m not asking you to convince me
otherwise.
She says it firmly, despite her weakness. Ingrid looks at her
and she knows it would be useless to try to convince Martha to
51
give up the idea. There is a moment when they have been left
on their own in the spacious foyer.
INGRID
(Slowly, fearful) I don’t know what to
say.
MARTHA
I’m hoping/I hope you’ll say yes.
INGRID
Yes to what?
MARTHA
To my asking you to help me.
INGRID
(Terrified) To help you what?
MARTHA
I’ve faced death several times, but I’ve
was always been accompanied, us reporters
formed a kind of mobile family. This is
another war, I’m not afraid of it, but
like the other times I faced death, I
don’t want to be alone, Ingrid. I’m just
asking you… to be in the next room.
Ingrid: consternation and silence. Martha is asking her, she
isn’t imposing it. Despite the lack of alternatives, she isn’t
using emotional blackmail on her. And she looks relaxed.
Ingrid doesn’t answer her. She refuses to talk about the
matter.
INGRID
I think we should go get our seats…
But Martha insists. She is determined to finish this
conversation.
52
MARTHA
Yeah, sure, but I prefer to go on talking
to you, if you don’t mind.
Ingrid takes a deep breath. It isn’t an easy moment, and she
can’t interrupt her friend in a conversation like this.
INGRID
Okay… Do you know when you want to do
this?
MARTHA
Not exactly… within a month…? Before I
start to deteriorate and you don’t
recognize me… During these first weeks,
I'll still be reasonably well, that's why
I want to do it soon. The doctors think
I’m going to return to continue with the
treatment. So it’s best if they don’t
suspect anything.
INGRID
Do you know where you want to do it?
MARTHA
(She reflects) I don’t want to be at home,
or go back to someplace where I was happy
in the past. We must never return to the
places where we were truly happy because
we ruin the good memories of the first
time...
INGRID
I know what that is…
MARTHA
I think it will be easier for me to let
myself go if I’m not surrounded by
53
familiar things, intimate things. I think
that would hold me back. I prefer an/some
unknown place… somewhere comfortable and
safe, and not too far away.
INGRID
(She doubts) Do you need my help finding a
place, or getting you settled in?
She looks at her as if Ingrid hasn’t understood her.
MARTHA
No, no… I can do that myself. What I need
is someone to be there with me, in the
room next door.
There are pauses in the conversation while Ingrid, stunned,
tries to assimilate what her friend is asking of her.
INGRID
Wouldn’t you prefer someone that you’re
closer to?
MARTHA
We’re very close.
INGRID
Yes, we are. Of course we are… Oh my God!
Yes! We’re very close! But we didn’t see
each other for years… What about Stella,
Vanessa, Maggie… You’ve all been friends
since you were kids.
By direct cut, the conversation continues.
38. IN MARTHA’S APARTMENT, NIGHT FALLING, WITH THE SKYLINE IN
THE BACKGROUND.
54
The two women are sitting facing each other, with the
Manhattan skyline fading slowly. There isn’t much light in
Martha’s apartment. They’re drinking something. And perhaps
one of them is smoking. Martha, for example. Or in the
kitchen, preparing something.
MARTHA
I admit it. I thought of them first. I
asked all three of them, and they were all
horrified. They all said no. They
understood it, but they said they could
never be a part of helping me take my own
life. Absolutely not.
INGRID
What about your daughter?
MARTHA
It wouldn’t be fair to her, I’ve been an
absent mother. I don’t want to impose my
dying on her.
INGRID
But… you could consult her, let her be
part of it…
Martha shakes her head and gets up and heads over to the
balcony in silence. She opens the door.
MARTHA
We’re two strangers, Ingrid. She made that
clear when I told her my doubts about the
treatment. It’s your choice, she said. And
she’s right.
INGRID
Right.
55
Martha shakes her head, she gets up in silence and
opens the balcony door. Noises comes in, some
grating. City life becomes present. Marth inhales
deeply and sits on a bench, near the open window.
MARTHA
(Breathlessness, with some resentment) No
matter what, people want you to keep on
fighting. This is how we’ve been taught to
see cancer: as a fight between patient and
disease, which is to say between good and
evil (breathless). If you survive, well
you’re a hero. And If you lose… well,
perhaps you didn’t fight hard enough.
People don’t want to hear the words
“terminal” or “incurable”. They call that
defeatist talk.
For Ingrid, it is very hard to listen to this last monologue.
She gets up, goes over to the window and closes it. She stands
listening to Martha.
MARTHA(CONT’D)
Some of the worst things come from the
cancer support community. Some of them
think of your cancer as a gift, an
opportunity for spiritual growth.
Bullshit!
She moves her head in a gesture of repulsion. Martha gets up
and tries to take a few steps away from Ingrid. She is too
tired and has to sit down again.
MARTHA
People should understand that this is my
56
way of fighting. Cancer can’t get me if I
get me first. What’s the sense in waiting
when I’m so ready to go?
Ingrid gets up and sits opposite her friend.
INGRID
Are you completely sure you’re ready?
MARTHA
Totally… since the first diagnosis.
INGRID
(As if apologizing) You know that I have a
terrible fear of death…
MARTHA
I know. I read your book. That’s why I
didn’t ask you first. But you understand
me, don’t you? (she begs her)
INGRID
Of course. I do. And I envy you. You’re in
control of your life.
MARTHA
I only need you to accompany me on the
days leading up to it, as if we were on
vacation. I just need to know that, when
it happens, there’ll be someone in the
next room.
INGRID
It terrifies me, Martha.
MARTHA
I understand that.
Martha goes back to the table.
INGRID
57
You have every right to do this, and I
admire you for it, but it terrifies me to
be the one to find you dead. I’m not that
strong.
MARTHA
You’re much stronger than you think…
Anyway, I had to try.
She tries to smile, weakly. Ingrid returns to the table as
well.
INGRID
I can’t answer you right now, Martha, but
I promise I’ll think about it. Right now
I’m too confused and too terrified.
MARTHA
I understand… it’s so sudden… it’s
disconcerting. I’ll think of someone.
Ingrid knows that that someone doesn’t exist. And it makes her
sad.
Ingrid gets up to leave. She gathers her purse. They walk to
the door in silence, and they kiss goodbye.
While still embraced, cheek to cheek, Martha whispers:
MARTHA
I wasn’t too much?
INGRID
No, no!
58
Ingrid exits the apartment. Martha closes the door and stands
there, thinking that in effect, she has no one else to ask for
help.
39. OUTSIDE MARTHA’S BUILDING. NIGHT
Ingrid emerges slowly, pensive, from the building where Martha
lives. She can’t stop thinking about her friend’s proposal,
and about her loneliness. Once on the sidewalk, she raises her
hand to stop a cab.
By a cut.
40. TAXI. INT. THROUGH THE CITY STREETS.
Ingrid returns to her new home, in the Lower East Side. She
can’t stop thinking about Martha’s proposal.
She takes her phone from her purse. She looks for Martha’s
number.
MARTHA (OFF)
Hello, Ingrid.
INGRID
Hi, I’ve made up my mind.
41. INGRID’S RENTAL HOME. LOWER EAST SIDE. INT. DAY
There are still some removal boxes, or books piled up on one.
Ingrid and Damian go straight into the kitchen. Damian is a
man of about sixty, still attractive (he is the lover shared
with her friend). With Ingrid, he overflows with pleasantness
and concern, but it is clear that it’s an exception, he is a
59
forceful character. Ingrid is nervous and probably Damian
still likes her.
The décor in the apartment is very special and relaxing. The
furniture is mostly second-hand, but the pieces have been
chosen with intention and good taste. The person who lived
here before must have been very bohemian and exquisite. Ingrid
fixes something to drink in the kitchen.
Seeing Damian’s skeptical look, Ingrid thinks she should give
him an explanation about the place.
INGRID
Come on in… The owner’s a jewelry
designer… she’s a friend of mine, so I
don’t pay much rent.
DAMIAN
You get the impression it’s been furnished
with stuff from the garbage.
INGRID
(Smiling) Not everything… And it takes
talent to pick furniture out of the
garbage.
DAMIAN
You still haven’t finished moving in. Do
you want a hand?
INGRID
No… I’ll do it… after. (She was going to
say after Martha dies)
DAMIAN
And, even so, you’re going with Martha?
INGRID
She is totally alone in this, Damian, none
of her friends are supporting her with
60
this. She even told me I wasn’t her first
choice. And it’s like her daughter doesn’t
even exist.
DAMIAN
In the years I was with her, she never
told me she had a daughter.
INGRID
It’s a very sad story, a terrible
misunderstanding.
DAMIAN
Have you told her we’re in touch?
INGRID
No. We’ve talked about you… in a general
sort of way. She has fond memories of you.
She smiles thinking about sex between the two of them.
DAMIAN
Really? I’m glad. Our relationship was
mostly physical. She was always about to
go off somewhere else, that’s why our
lovemaking had that sense of urgency. It
was like having sex with a terrorist, it
always felt like the last time.
INGRID
She rates you pretty highly as a lover.
DAMIAN
(Flattered) I’d like to know what rating
you give me…
They take their drinks and sit in the dining room, on a large
couch that had a previous life, but it is still pretty and
special.
61
INGRID
Damian, I can’t believe you’re still
flirting with me.
DAMIAN
I’m serious.
INGRID
No, you’re not serious. What’s really
serious here is Martha’s situation.
DAMIAN
And your being terrified of death? You’ve
just published a book about that. Have you
overcome that thanks to the book?
INGRID
No.
42. MARTHA’S APARTMENT. WASHINGTON SQUARE. INT. DAY
43. INGRID’S APARTMENT. LOWER EAST SIDE. INT. DAY.
Martha is watering her plants in the terrace.
INGRID
Hi, how are you?
MARTHA
Better, much better since you said yes.
Ingrid hears the sound of the street as Martha is out on her
terrace, watering her plants.
INGRID
Where are you? Are you at home?
MARTHA
Yeah, I’m watering the plants.
INGRID
62
I thought you had someone who took care of
that?
MARTHA
I do… but today I felt like doing it. And
I’m enjoying it!
INGRID
Good… Have you decided where we’re going?
MARTHA
That’s why I called… It’s near Woodstock,
about two hours from the city. The owners
travel constantly and rent out the house
to pay for their trips. It looks
fantastic, it’s a bit expensive, but, hey,
the occasion calls for it.
Martha sounds very animated and in good humor, even excited at
the approaching journey.
INGRID
How long do you… think…? (She doesn’t dare
say that she still hasn’t finished
unpacking and organizing her Lower East
Side apartment.)
MARTHA
I rented it for a month. That should give
me more than enough time.
INGRID
(She thinks it’s a lot) A month?!
She feels conflicted and doesn’t like that Damian is there to
see it.
MARTHA
Yeah, my blood count’s low and I have to
63
take a break before I start the new
treatment. You are the only one who knows
I’m not going back to the hospital.
Ingrid looks at Damian, again she doesn’t know what to say.
Will she ever get used to this kind of remark?
MARTHA(CONT’D)
It’s not like I’ve picked a date, I mean…
You’ll never know it anyway, but I’m ready
to go. I would even say I’m impatient.
CUT TO:
44. INGRID’S APARTMENT. INT. DAY
Ingrid tells Damian the name of the place where they’re going,
near to (she says the name of a large city).
DAMIAN
Oh, I’m going to be giving a lecture near
Woodstock, at Bard, in two weeks. Maybe we
can see each other…
INGRID
I don’t think that’s a good idea. I’ll be
with Martha the whole time… I’ll call you
if I can.
DAMIAN
You’re going to need a lawyer.
INGRID
(Dubious) Yes… I should look for one.
DAMIAN
Let me take care of that. But I’ll have to
fill them in.
64
INGRID
No. In that case, no. This is an absolute
secret. She doesn’t even know I’ve told
you.
DAMIAN
Okay, but if there’s anything you need,
just let me know. I worry about you.
INGRID
Thank you.
Ingrid is shocked, or maybe she responds to his gesture. She
likes to count on Damian’s unexpected help.
45. THE CAR DRIVES ALONG SOME ROADS. EXT. DAY
The two women are in a rental car. One of them has a purse.
46. CAR. INT. DAY
The two women inside the car. Martha looks out the side
window, as if saying goodbye to all that. Ingrid drives,
serious. They listen to music.
47. HOUSE IN WOODS. EXT. DAY. NEW ENGLAND
The car, driven by Ingrid, pulls up on the lawn in front of
the house in the woods, from where we can see part of the
structure.
When Martha exits the car, she’s holding the keys in one hand
and a map of the different rooms inside the house in the
other. Ingrid has a couple of bags, one in each hand. She also
carries a purse on her shoulder. The map allows her to situate
the different rooms from the exterior. Preceding the two women
are a set of granite steps.
65
MARTHA
According to the map, we go up these steps
to enter the house.
They climb the steps and maybe, fascinated by the
grandioseness of the trees and the rest of the surroundings,
they make some comment. Martha climbs, more by her sheer force
of will to discover the house than her physical strength. She
struggles to climb the stairs, but she’s happy.
48. HOUSE IN WOODS. INT. DAY
From inside, we see them open the door and enter the house
like two girls enchanted by a magical spell. Just off to the
right of the entrance is the kitchen, where on the countertop
of the island that separates the dining room an information
sheet and a three ring binder or booklet welcome them. The
kitchen window is huge and trapezoidal and faces the woods.
Instead of walls, the house is built with massive glass
windows, thick and all of them different, trapezoidal shapes
of varying sizes. All the windows are covered by off white
blinds. Across from the kitchen is a round dining room table
and a pristine gray wall to wall cabinet off to the left. The
cabinet has built in drawers and doors from top to bottom. On
the table is a remote control (or perhaps by the three ring
binder).
Ingrid grabs the remote and her intuition tells her it’s for
opening the blinds. Seen from the outside, through the kitchen
window, both women seem to float among the different
reflections.
INGRID
66
Look at that!
The large blind before them begins its slow ascent,
accompanied by a constant whirring.
With the camera inside the house now, we move with them to
discover the exterior views from each window as the blinds
reveal the scene, each of them offset in time, and the trees
around the house are revealed in a type of choreography that
permits us to take in the spectacular view in a dynamic and
fragmented way. (The house is truly in the middle of the
woods). Off in the distance, a dark mountain and a blue
springtime sky.
INGRID
Wow! It’s so beautiful!
MARTHA
(Overwhelmed, remembering the reason why
they’re there.) It’s so much more
beautiful than the photographs!
The two women look around them, fascinated. On their way to
the door that leads to the back yard, they come across a
painting on the only visible wall. It’s a reproduction of the
Edward Hopper painting, People in the Sun. Several individuals
sunbathe, motionless, near to a house, of which we only see a
small section of the facade. The individuals seem to have no
relationship to one another. They are all sitting in wooden
recliners with armrests. In front of them are yellow fields of
wheat, and off in the distance we can see a low mountain
range. The two women stop for a moment to look at the
painting.
MARTHA
67
Is that a real Hopper?
INGRID
I don’t think they would have left it
here. But it’s a very good copy, it looks
real.
49. HOUSE IN WOODS. INT. DAY.
From outside the house we see them step out onto the lawn and
admire the trees, the sky and the infinite beyond as if it
were the first time they were in contact with nature. Not far
from the door that leads to the back lawn are two lounge
chairs, separated by a small wooden table. The lounge chairs
seem to be beckoning them. They hear the different bird songs
and the buzzing of bees.
MARTHA
Do you hear them?! How wonderful!
Ingrid nods her head in affirmation, unable to speak. They
look at the lounge chairs and each of them chooses one and
lies down to check how comfortable they are.
MARTHA(CONT’D)
We can also lie out here in the sun like
in the Hopper painting. And catch the
evening breeze.
The house is composed of various cubicles set in the side of a
small slope in the middle of a forest. The different volumes
are connected by short staircases that run between them
throughout the house, and in this way the house is perfectly
adapted to the terrain.
68
Down below, from one side of the garden to the other,
stretches a flat rectangular blue pool that sits so still that
it reflects the distant mountain like a mirror embedded into
the earth.
CUT TO.
50. HALLWAY/MARTHA’S ROOM. INT. DAY.
Martha and Ingrid walk down a hallway to the bedrooms. Martha
opens a door when she gets to the end of the hall. It’s the
master bedroom. Just like the house, just like the lounge
chairs, it seems that the bedroom beckons her inside. She
opens the door completely and steps inside to look around.
Through the window, apart from the garden, she can see the
pool, serene. Without a doubt, it’s her bedroom.
MARTHA
Do you mind if I take this one?
INGRID
No! Of course not. It’s your house.
Ingrid looks inside a bedroom in the hallway, but it’s too
small.
INGRID
Oh, this one’s a little small… I’m going
to look downstairs.
MARTHA
Okay.
51. STAIRS / INGRID’S ROOM
69
Ingrid walks down a spiral staircase with about twelve stairs
that leads her to the bottom floor of the house. She opens a
door. She likes the room.
A few seconds later her head appears in a space at the bottom
of the staircase, almost screaming:
INGRID
(From downstairs, yelling) I’m going to
take this one, okay?!
From where Ingrid’s standing, she can see Martha’s bedroom
door is open. They holler back and forth at each other.
MARTHA
Very good!
INGRID
You don’t mind that I’m not in the room
next door?
MARTHA
I can hear you breathe… And yell.
CUT TO.
52. HOUSE IN WOODS. HALL / MARTHAS´S ROOM. INT. DAY
Ingrid enters the house once again, carrying the two suitcases
from the car. The rest of the luggage, maybe a bag or two,
she’ll have brought up before. Both suitcases have wheels and
she leaves one of them in Martha’s room. Martha’s still
thrilled, but she’s lied down on the bed, exhausted from her
earlier efforts. Ingrid walks down the three steps so that
she’s level with the bed. She leaves the other suitcase in the
hallway to take it down to her room afterwards.
70
INGRID
Let me help you unpack.
MARTHA
Thank you, I’ll unpack it later. You’re
not my caretaker, Ingrid. You’re my guest.
INGRID
Okay, then I’ll unpack my things.
53. INGRID’S BEDROOM. HOUSE IN WOODS. INT. DAY
Ingrid enters her bedroom. She opens her suitcase. She takes
out a few of her things. She places her computer on a desk and
some transparent folders with pages inside. Books. Various
note blocks and writing materials.
From the moment she stepped into the house, she's felt much
better than during the trip up, and her fears and uncertainty
from the previous days has all but disappeared. She has her
half-unpacked suitcase on the bed when she hears noises coming
from Martha’s room. Indistinct grumbling that turns into
groans and full blown complaints coming from above.
54. HOUSE IN WOODS. MARTHA’S ROOM. INT. DAY
She goes to Martha’s room and finds it in a mess, the contents
of her suitcase and her bags scattered violently all around
the room.
INGRID
(Scared) What's wrong, honey?
MARTHA
(Furious) You won’t believe it…!
INGRID
71
What?
Martha gathers the little strength she has left to shout:
MARTHA
I forgot it!
INGRID
Forgot what?
MARTHA
The pill, the euthanasia pill! I brought
all the others! We have to go back now.
Ingrid tries to calm her down.
INGRID
Of course. We can go first thing in the
morning.
MARTHA
No, not tomorrow. We have to go now!
Ingrid looks at her, she can’t believe she’s serious.
MARTHA(CONT’D)
(A little beside herself) I have to be
sure that I didn’t lose it or misplace it,
that I didn’t just dream it up!
INGRID
Okay. Let’s go…
Ingrid doesn’t dare object in such a state of tension, and in
general Martha is much stronger than her.
55. HIGHWAYS. EXT. LATER THAN THE FIRST TIME.
72
The car heads for New York, with the two friends inside, in
silence. Martha starts to speak, more slowly, exhausted.
MARTHA
Buying another pill would be extremely
complicated. I have a friend who knows a
mathematician who found it on the Dark
Web. It’s all very sordid, not to mention
totally illegal. It’s scary knowing that
all that exists, right behind our computer
screens… I felt like a real criminal.
56. MARTHA’S APARTMENT. WASHINGTON SQUARE. NIGHTFALL. INT.
They arrive at Martha’s apartment. They’re on the landing.
They open the door and go inside. Martha looks around.
MARTHA
I never thought I’d be back here, that I’d
see this wonderful skyline again. Life
always surprises you.
She turns to Ingrid.
MARTHA
Well, let’s get to work. I’ll start in the
kitchen.
INGRID
Don’t worry. I’ll help you find it.
She knows that it sounds like looking for a needle in a
haystack. But she also knows that she can’t back out. Her
friend needs her much more than she’d thought.
73
INGRID
Just think of the places where you usually
hide things.
MARTHA
This is the first thing I’ve ever hidden.
The only thing I remember is that I put it
in an envelope.
INGRID
I’ll start in your office.
Ingrid says this to fill the void… she could actually start
anywhere.
MARTHA
(Distraught, to Ingrid) Yes. (Talking to
herself, blaming her lack of memory) Where
did I put it?
Martha starts opening and rummaging through her kitchen
drawers.
57. MARTHA’S OFFICE AND MARTHA’S BEDROOM. INT. DAY.
Ingrid starts looking in all the places where she would have
kept something like that. At the back of the closet drawers.
In a toilet bag.
In the office, she opens the closet. She finds several
drawers, she opens one that has a key in the lock. Inside
there are postcards, letters, mementoes, photos and two note
books full of notes. Ingrid opens them and glances at them.
Notes about different wars. An entire one about the war in the
Balkans. She looks through them. The two volumes are written
right to the last page. She’d like to sit down and read them,
74
but she remembers that what she should be looking for is a
pill.
She looks in various places until she finds another drawer,
also with a key in the lock. Among different objects and
papers, there is an envelope that would seem to be
deliberately sticking out from among the pile, so as to be
found easily. There is just one word written on the envelope:
Goodbye. From touch, the envelope seems only to contain a
sheet of paper. By feeling, the surface of the envelope from
one side to the other, Ingrid discovers that there is
something tiny inside it, it could be a pill. She doesn’t dare
open it to check the contents. She thinks for a moment that
death weighs nothing, a few grams, what the envelope weighs.
She’ll have to reflect in the future on this matter, the
lightness of death.
Ingrid finds Martha in her bedroom, with the bed covered by
clothes, she’s been searching in the pockets. An image of
great confusion. Ingrid looks at her in silence and wonders if
that is going to be the tone of the trip. She thinks she may
have been too hasty in saying yes to her friend. She is
holding the envelope with something inside and hands it to
Martha.
INGRID
I found an envelope.
MARTHA
(Excited) That’s it!
She opens it anyway to make sure. Inside it, there is a folded
sheet of paper, there’s nothing written on it. The pill is
between the two halves.
75
MARTHA(CONT’D)
(Much calmer) Where did you find it?
INGRID
A drawer in your desk. The key was in the
lock and I opened it.
MARTHA
How could I have forgotten it? I even left
the key in it!?
INGRID
You were going to take it and, at the last
minute, you forgot. It isn’t so unusual.
MARTHA
Thank you.
58. LIVING ROOM. INT. MARTHA’S APARTMENT. WASHINGTON SQUARE.
The two women are standing in front of the terrace, looking
out over the city.
MARTHA
What a strange sensation! It’s like being
back at home after I’m dead.
INGRID
Don’t say that. It’s too soon for you to
be referring to yourself as a ghost.
Martha is amused by this remark.
INGRID(CONT’D)
I’m going to straighten up… before we
leave.
MARTHA
(Looking at Ingrid, grateful) Thank you.
76
All the fuss of the journey has left Martha exhausted. She
sits in an armchair looking out at the terrace. In front of
her, the day is fading behind New York’s sky scrapers.
59. HIGHWAY. EXT. NIGHT
We see the car going in the opposite direction through the
same place where we saw it when they were heading for New
England, hours before.
60. HOUSE IN WOODS. NIGHT. EXT.
Ingrid parks the car on the ground around the house again.
61. HOUSE IN WOODS. NIGHT.
They come into the house. They are exhausted and carry some
groceries with them. Enough for some dinner and breakfast the
next morning.
MARTHA
Thank you, and forgive me for all this
hassle. I’m so sorry, really.
Ingrid gestures that it’s all right, even though she’s
physically exhausted. They go into the kitchen.
MARTHA
What a great place to return to.
CUT TO:
62. DINNER IN THE KITCHEN. HOUSE IN WOODS. INT. NIGHT
77
It’s obvious that Martha isn’t hungry, she pretends to be
eating, very slowly.
At some point in the following conversation Ingrid gets up and
goes over to the refrigerator, grabs a bottle of wine and
serves herself a glass. Or she brings the bottle back to the
table with her, and serves herself a glass there. This simple
action will make the scene, which is too long for them to
simply sit at the table, more dynamic and will allow me to
play with different angles.
INGRID
Maybe leaving the pill behind… was a kind
of sign? Maybe you’re not as ready as you
think…
MARTHA
I told you to never say that to me.
INGRID
I don’t remember you telling me that.
MARTHA
(Exhausted) I think I’ve told you so many
things… That’s the problem with chemo
brain.
Ingrid knows what she’s talking about, but she says nothing.
She looks at her inquisitively.
MARTHA(CONT’D)
(As if she were guilty) My memory fails me
and I get distracted so easily. It can
continue even after the treatment stops
and it can last for years. I’ll be spared
that, at least. When I write… when I
wrote… I had to proofread everything a
78
thousand times. I can’t trust my judgement
about anything anymore.
Ingrid lets her breathe. She hesitates. She speaks with great
tact.
INGRID
Then how can you trust this decision that
has brought us here? How do you know that
isn’t also chemo brain too?
With the following explanation, Martha makes it clear that she
never wants to talk about it again and hopes that Ingrid
understands and respects this.
MARTHA
I’ve left the pill in the top drawer of
the bedside table. If I forget, which I
don’t think I will, you will remind me.
(Firm) And I prefer to not talk about this
anymore.
INGRID
It concerns me too, don’t you think?
Ingrid gets up and goes over to the refrigerator for
another glass of wine.
MARTHA
Sure. Of course. I’ll leave a signed
letter for the police telling them
everything. Including the name of the pill
and how I got it. Your name won’t appear
anywhere. (She explains) All you have to
do is to say that you knew nothing, and
79
just don’t budge from that. I don’t want
to give you any more information. The less
you know, the better. And this is
important. I’ll sleep with the door open.
The day that you find it closed means that
it’s already happened. That’s the sign:
door closed.
Ingrid looks at her, sad and frightened. Martha takes note.
MARTHA (CONT’D)
I know it’s difficult. Just think we’re on
vacation. You can write, we can come and
go…
INGRID
I don’t think I’ll be able to concentrate.
(Somber) And if I write about myself, you
might show up somewhere… and I don’t want
to do that.
MARTHA
I don’t want that either. It would
complicate your life if the police
investigate…
INGRID
But I’m not going to do it.
MARTHA
Wait until I’m dead.
Ingrid looks at her. She doesn’t like this part of the
conversation and thinks it’s in bad taste to talk with a dying
person about her own death, and writing about her once she’s
dead.
INGRID
80
(Serious, upset) Can you not say “wait
until I’m dead”? Please!
Martha agrees with her friend.
MARTHA
(Serious) I promise.
The two women relax. Ingrid eats a little.
INGRID
I’d like to find a gym to go to a couple
times a week. I’m the only one of the two
who eats and I don’t want to gain ten
pounds while you waste away.
MARTHA
Give me a chance! I’ll catch up with you!
Look at me! I'm eating.
And she raises a carrot stick to her mouth, with a
bit of hummus.
Ingrid looks at her like someone seeing a spectacle. Again,
she isn’t sure that she did the right thing in accompanying
Martha on her journey towards death.
63. INGRID’S BEDROOM. HOUSE IN WOODS. INT. NIGHT.
Ingrid comes into her bedroom. She finishes putting her things
in the closet. She writes in a notebook.
INGRID (OFF)
I’ve practically held death in my hands
and I never imagined it would be something
81
so light.
64. HOUSE IN WOODS. MARTHA’S BEDROOM INT. NIGHT.
The following alternates with the previous scene.
Martha is lying on her bed, just before falling asleep. Her
silhouette is cut out with the background woods that inundates
the bedroom through the huge window. The blind is open: in the
distance, dark trees silhouetted, and a corner of the
illuminated swimming pool, bright and blue in the night. The
mountain is almost black in the distance, and the sky, a
little lighter than the mountain.
FADE TO BLACK:
65. HOUSE IN WOODS. INGRID´S ROOM / STAIRS / KITCHEN. INT.
DAY.
The next morning, Ingrid comes out of her room. She starts to
climb the stairs and looks at the door of Martha’s room with
an uneasy expression. The door is open. She climbs the rest of
the stairs that separate her from the bedroom.
She knocks on the open door. She doesn’t get an answer. She
looks inside, there’s no one there.
She goes to the kitchen. She finds Martha there, making
breakfast. She has chosen two mugs. She will always choose the
same ones.
MARTHA
I’m making breakfast. Would you like some
toast?
82
INGRID
Coffee first.
MARTHA
Help yourself. It’s already made. There’s
cereal and juice as well. Whatever you
want.
The coffee pot is full. Ingrid pours a cup for herself.
MARTHA(CONT’D)
If I get on your nerves, I could give you
an oxycontin, but I don’t want you to get
hooked.
INGRID
What makes you think that I need one! The
last thing I need is to be a drug addict!
MARTHA
My behavior yesterday was unacceptable. I
completely understand that it drove you
crazy. I’ll try not to let it happen
again, but in my current state I can’t
make any promises. So, just in case, I’ve
left a medium range sedative, in this
drawer. If you find me unbearable, you can
take one and you can relax.
INGRID
(Smiling) I might take you up on that/I
could have used one last night. You’re one
of a kind, Martha. You really are.
CUT TO:
66. HOUSE IN THE WOODS. GARDEN. ON THE LOUNGE CHAIRS. DAY.
83
Martha is lying on one of the lounge chairs and Ingrid is
sitting on the other lounge chair with a list of groceries in
her hand.
INGRID
I’ve made a list of stuff to buy. We need
a few things.
She shows it to her.
INGRID(CONT’D)
Is there anything you want me to get?
MARTHA
I don’t think so.
INGRID
Do you want to come to the store with me?
MARTHA
Maybe another day. It feels so nice here,
I think I’d like to stay. If you don’t
mind…
INGRID
No, of course not. I also found a gym that
isn’t too far away.
MARTHA
That’s great. I think it’s a very good
idea.
Ingrid gets up and gives Martha a kiss on the cheek.
INGRID
Okay… I’ll have my phone with me if you
need anything…
MARTHA
Thanks, love.
84
Ingrid exits.
67. GYM. INT. DAY.
In the gym’s reception. Ingrid and the receptionist.
INGRID
Hello. I was hoping I could use the gym
today.
RECEPTIONIST
Are you a member?
INGRID
No. I’m just in town for a little bit.
RECEPTIONIST
Well, if you use one of our personal
trainers, you don’t need to be a member.
INGRID
Okay… I’ll use one of your trainers then.
RECEPTIONIST
You’ll like Jonah, you’ll see.
INGRID
Ok, thank you.
68. GYM ROOM. INT. DAY
At least, they’re alone. Jonah, the trainer, is muscular and
tattooed, as muscular as he is tattooed. Despite this, he has
the sweetness of a choirboy. Not the slightest trace of
toughness to accompany that amount of muscles and tattoos. He
speaks to Ingrid frankly, but calling her “young lady”. Ingrid
answers evasively to make it clear that she doesn’t like being
called that.
85
TRAINER
So, would you like to start a warm up
doing steps?
INGRID
Okay.
TRAINER
(Demonstrating the technique) Okay, do you
think you can do this for thirty seconds?
INGRID
Sure.
And she does them, ending up exhausted.
TRAINER
(Impressed) Nice! You’re pretty good, you
young lady.
INGRID
What I am is winded.
TRAINER
There are other variations we can do, like
this. (He demonstrates the different
versions.)
She inhales deeply to get her breath back. Suddenly, she
remembers Martha and her expression changes. It’s as if a
spear had been thrust into her chest.
TRAINER(CONT’D)
Is everything okay?
INGRID
(Thinking aloud) When your body’s in great
shape, it takes longer to die…
86
She has said it without looking at the trainer. To the young
man’s amazement, she continues.
INGRID (CONT’D)
When death comes, the mind wants to go
while the body keeps fighting. The heart
keeps saying “no” with every beat…
TRAINER
All the more reason to look after
yourself.
INGRID
I live with a friend who’s dying…
TRAINER
(Very affected) Oh, I’m sorry. Is there
anything that I can do?
Ingrid looks at him as if to say that, in those cases, words
aren’t of much use.
TRAINER(CONT’D)
(Suggesting) Come, let’s sit down.
They sit together on a mat.
TRAINER(CONT’D)
(With genuine empathy) I wish I could give
you a hug. But we’re not allowed to touch
clients anymore, because of lawsuits and
whatever. And it’s a problem, because it
can be hard to correct people’s posture
with just words. And touching is so
important.
INGRID
(Sad) This world is absurd and inhumane. I
87
don’t see it improving any time soon. But
thank you, I feel hugged.
She smiles at him with moist eyes.
69. A BOOKSTORE. TOWN. NEW ENGLAND
Ingrid and Martha in a very alternative bookstore. A big one.
They move down an elevated corridor surrounded by books.
Martha stops in front of one and takes out a voluminous book
called Erotic Vagrancy about Elizabeth Taylor and Richard
Burton.
MARTHA
Oh, look at that. Oh, I´ve been meaning to
read this book… What a wonderful title!
Erotic Vagrancy…
INGRID
Do you want to buy it?
The book looks like it has more than a thousand pages. She
smiles, nonchalantly…
MARTHA
(Putting back the book) I won’t have time
to finish it.
Ingrid still hasn’t gotten used to those kinds of comments.
She looks at her friend, affected, but by now Martha’s
spontaneity is becoming somewhat contagious. Ingrid takes the
book for herself.
CUT TO.
88
In another corner of the bookstore, a section dedicated to war
journals and books about war.
MARTHA
Oh, look. Martha Gellhorn. (She reads) The
View from the Ground.
Martha takes the book, almost tenderly.
MARTHA
She wrote you can only love one war,
afterwards you simply do your duty.
Ingrid takes the book out of Martha’s hands. She’s intending
to buy it.
INGRID
Which one was yours?
Next to them are two or three plastic boxes piled up, and a
ladder. Martha sits down on the boxes or the ladder.
70. BOOKSTORE. INT. DAY
MARTHA
Bosnia, without a doubt. The fight to
survive by the Bosnian people against a
perfectly equipped army stole the hearts
of all of us who witnessed the
extermination.
Ingrid watches and listens to her closely.
71. BOOKSTORE. INT. DAY
89
They walk towards the cash register. Martha continues talking.
MARTHA
There are very few women war
correspondents. War is a man’s thing. You
have to sort of become one of the guys. It
was never problem for me, I’ve always
lived like a man… Actually, I think… what
Michelle really missed… was having a
maternal figure in her life… And have to
admit… that she was right.
She says these last words in a sad tone.
INGRID
Don’t be so hard on yourself.
CUT TO:
72. BOOKSTORE. AT THE TILL. INT. DAY
Suddenly, Martha discovers a little poster, less than 50cm,
announcing a lecture by Damian Cunningham. She changes her
tone, she finally finds someone about whom to be ironic.
MARTHA(CONT’D)
Hey! Look who’s coming to town! The life
of the party! (Reading the poster) How bad
can it get? Navigating urban life with
integrity…
Cunningham is actually coming to a neighboring town, to one of
the public university campuses.
MARTHA (CONT’D)
…You feel like going?
90
INGRID
No… You know what? I´ve heard it already…
and it isn’t an evening I’d like to
repeat… We all have our own personal
apocalypses.
MARTHA
(Worried) Are you having an awful time
with me?
INGRID
No! I mean him, his lecture. Global
crises, the climate change… (To the
cashier) Hi…
Each one lays down her books on the counter, at the register.
Martha has chosen a novel by the Nobel Laureate Annie Ernaux.
Ingrid places the Martha Gellhorn and Erotic Vagrancy books on
the counter.
Martha looks up and says to the young man at the cash register
who smiles at them charmingly…
MARTHA
I love your hair.
CASHIER
Nice…
CUT TO.
73. IN THE STREET. EXT. DAY. NEW ENGLAND
Inside the car, Martha opens her bag and takes out a patch and
places it on her chest, just below her shoulder. Ingrid is
driving.
MARTHA
91
When the nightmares come rushing in… I
think about the men I’ve loved…
INGRID
Sounds like a song.
MARTHA
A good one… even if it was just for one
night… Sometimes I think about Damian.
Ingrid is surprised by this mention.
MARTHA
I still think sex is the best way to fend
off looming thoughts of death. Like those
Spanish Carmelites. Wars turned me into a
promiscuous woman, Ingrid.
INGRID
Good.
They smile.
MARTHA
Are you still in touch with him?
INGRID
With who?
MARTHA
With Damian.
INGRID
(Lying) I mean… from time to time.
MARTHA
(She wonders) How bad can it get? Well,
much worse than you imagine, Damian honey.
Ingrid takes refuge in silence. She doesn’t know what to add.
92
CUT TO.
74. HOUSE IN THE WOODS. STUDY. INT. NIGHT.
Martha is sitting at her desk. Her computer is turned on. At
one side is the book by Annie Ernaux that she bought, but she
isn’t doing anything, she isn’t reading the book or the
computer screen, she’s motionless, the prisoner perhaps of a
paralyzing thought. Ingrid appears at the door. She is
surprised by her friend’s stillness, her head erect.
INGRID
Are you all right?
MARTHA
I was trying to write… but I can’t… In
this war I’m incapable of writing
anything.
Martha is melancholic. Ingrid comes into the room. She has a
mug of tea in her hands. She sits or lies down next to the
window.
INGRID
And reading? You love to read. You've
always been a voracious reader.
There are several books in the bedroom, as well as Ernaux’s.
The owners’ books.
MARTHA
I’ve tried it, tried it with some of my
favorite writers… but the spell just isn’t
there anymore. I’m talking about Faulkner,
Hemingway… But I can’t concentrate… my
93
mind just flies off into the void.
INGRID
If you’re too tired, I can read to you.
As if she hasn’t heard her.
MARTHA
It’s not just reading, all pleasure’s been
reduced. It’s hard to know what I should
pay attention to anymore… because I have
very little time and I don’t want to waste
it.
INGRID
What about music?
MARTHA
I can only listen to the birds singing.
INGRID
Well, luckily they give us a serenade
every day.
MARTHA
Music decenters me, it comes between me
and what I’m doing at that moment, even if
it’s just thinking. Maybe the chemo is
affecting my hearing.
INGRID
Oh, honey.
Ingrid goes over and puts her arms around her. Martha finds
consolation in Ingrid’s embrace, but she continues in the same
line.
MARTHA
I’ve been reduced to very little of
myself. I just long to have some peace of
94
body and mind… and to talk when I’m
invaded by memories. Am I talking too
much?
INGRID
Talk all you want, I love listening to
you.
CUT TO.
75. INGRID’S BEDROOM. DAWN.
Ingrid wakes. The day still hasn’t dawned or it is starting to
dawn. Even so, she gets up. She goes to the stairs that
separate her from the first floor. By only climbing three
steps, she can see the door of Martha’s room above. It is
closed. (She thinks to herself that it had to happen that
night. She should have understood that the conversation with
Martha the night before was indicative. She’s reproaches
herself for not having said anything to her friend.)
That was the sign. She goes up the two flights of stairs
(about nine steps) and stands motionless at the door of
Martha’s room, breathing unsteadily. She doesn’t know what to
do. Queasy, she goes to the kitchen and vomits into the sink.
She pours herself a glass of water. But the panic is so bad
she can’t drink it. She sits at the table and goes to pieces.
She tries time and again to order her thoughts, but it’s
useless. She searches in a drawer where there are vitamins and
also tranquilizers. She remembers that Martha put them there.
She takes a tranquilizer with water and sits down again to
order her thoughts. We hear the blackbirds announcing the
dawn.
95
76. HOUSE IN THE WOODS. DAWN.
She goes out to the garden to listen to the birds. And she
contemplates a magnificent dawn, telling herself that Martha
won’t be able to contemplate the new sun, and she starts to
cry.
77. HOUSE IN THE WOODS. INT./EXT. DAWN.
Martha walks through the three modules inside the house, like
a ghost, and stops just behind Ingrid. She sees her crying on
a lounger in the garden. They are separated by the glass. She
taps on the glass to get her attention. Ingrid turns to look
into the house, her eyes filled with tears. In the next
sentences they understand even though they don’t fully hear
each other. One is inside and the other outside. (Pending
rehearsal with the actresses.)
MARTHA
What are you doing up? What’s wrong?
INGRID
Your door was closed. I thought you…
MARTHA
Oh, I’m so sorry… I opened the window and
the breeze must have closed the door.
Martha, going over to her, before she hugs her. Furious,
Ingrid, breaks free of Martha, who’s trying to give her a hug.
INGRID
I threw up. Oh my God.
Ingrid enters the house.
96
78. INSIDE THE HOUSE IN THE WOODS. DAWN.
The space is invaded by dawn light. From inside, we see Ingrid
arrive at the kitchen and exit frame to go clean the kitchen
sink. Martha follows her, almost enjoying the fury of her
friend.
MARTHA
Do you think it's fair to be angry with me
because I’m still alive?
While Ingrid cleans up the vomit, Martha goes down the stairs
into the kitchen, opposite Ingrid, on the other side of the
counter. She insists in taking the edge off the situation.
MARTHA (CONT’D)
Take it as a rehearsal. Now you know how
it's going to be. This is how you're going
to feel. You'll have to make some calls
and act out everything we talked about.
You don't know anything. We were on
vacation.
INGRID
(Scolding her) Please… don't. Stop!
MARTHA
Okay.
Martha nods.
79. LIVING ROOM. IN FRONT OF THE TELEVISION. NIGHT.
The two are sitting, very close to each other. They are
watching something on the big screen. Martha has taken an
opiate, OxyContin. She’s a bit groggy. On the television
screen, Buster Keaton running down a hill, dodging an
97
avalanche of stones, trying to get his wife, drunk and
unconscious, into bed. Fleeing from a police patrol, getting
tangled up in the ropes of a boxing ring, trying get his wife,
drunk and unconscious, into bed (laughter), being threatened
by men much stronger than him, adoring a very large brown cow
and being adored by it, trying get his wife, drunk and
unconscious, into bed. Buster Keaton falls, time and again,
the bed collapses under the weight of his drunk, unconscious
wife. The film is called The Great Buster and is signed by
Peter Bogdanovich.
Martha smiles sweetly, Ingrid laughs honestly and at the same
time feels infinite tenderness towards her friend. She hugs
her, their two faces close together, while Buster Keaton
continues doing extraordinary things on the television screen.
CUT TO:
80. IT IS EARLY MORNING. HOUSE IN THE WOODS. INT.
There are the remains of food on the table, something that
Ingrid has eaten. There are other DVD cases on the table as
well. They have done a movie marathon. Time has passed.
Ingrid is putting away another movie they’ve seen. Letter from
an Unknown Woman, crouching by the DVD player…
INGRID
So, should we call it a night, or does the
‘young lady’ want to keep watching movies?
MARTHA
(Still a little out of it) Did you tell me
they had The Dead... or did I dream that?
INGRID
98
(Getting up) Yeah. They have it. Do you
want to watch it?
MARTHA
Yes… please…
Ingrid gets up and takes the DVD from the bookcase. We see the
case of the DVD and Ingrid’s hand selecting among the other
DVD’s.
By cut. DISSOLVE TO:
81. FRAGMENT OF JOHN H0USTON’S FILM. THE END OF THE DEAD.
Angelica Huston has just told her husband, at the foot of the
bed, looking through the window at the falling snow, the story
of an adolescent love who died from having waited uselessly in
the garden of her house while it was snowing. An off screen
voice, her husband’s, reflects on this and on the place where
they live in Ireland. With the off screen voice the places the
character mentions appear.
HUSBAND (OFF)
Yes, the newspapers were right. Snow was
falling on every part of the dark central
plain, on the treeless hills, falling
softly on the Bog of Allen and, farther
westward, softly falling into the dark
mutinous Shannon waves. One by one, we’re
all becoming shades.
Ingrid, emotional, contemplates the screen, with Martha asleep
on her shoulder. She looks at her, perhaps Martha can hear
through dreams what the melancholic husband says in Huston’s
film.
99
HUSBAND (OFF)
The snow is falling, falling on the lonely
churchyard where Michael Furey lies
buried, falling faintly through the
universe and faintly falling, like the
descent of their last end, upon all the
living and the dead.
With her eyes half closed, Martha murmurs: upon all the living
and the dead. She is sleepy, the final words of The Dead meld
with the chirping of the birds at dawn. On the television
screen, the snow is still falling over the background of an
intense nocturnal blue.
82. HOUSE IN THE WOODS. INT. DAWN.
Day is breaking over the house in the woods, light starts to
define the contours of the window and the door that looks out
on the garden. It gives the impression that the snow from The
Dead is also falling faintly on them, on the face of Martha,
sleeping on Ingrid’s breast, and that the snow, as happened in
the hospital, receives the light of dawn (then it was
nightfall).
Martha wakes up slowly. From where they are sitting, they hear
the trills of the birds announcing a new day. Martha listens
to them in wonder.
MARTHA
Do you hear them?
Ingrid’s eyes are tear-filled, at both the ending of the film
and the situation they’re going through.
100
INGRID
Yes. It’s daytime. And you’re alive.
83. INGRID’S ROOM. INT. NIGHT
It is still night, it will soon be dawn. Ingrid wakes. On the
night stand is a book she’s reading. And another one. There’s
a glass of water, or a bottle. There’s also the cultural
supplement of The New York Times, or a copy of The New Yorker
on the ground, on the rug. She turns on the light. She looks
at the time on her phone, which sits on the nightstand.
84. CONTINUOUS
She climbs the stairs to Martha’s room. The door is open.
85. MARTHA’S ROOM
Ingrid moves closer and looks at her friend in bed. She’s
motionless. She gets into bed and lies down with her. Without
waking, Martha smiles when she senses the warmth of Ingrid’s
body next to hers.
86. HOUSE IN THE WOODS. WOODS. EXT. DAY.
Martha and Ingrid walk through the woods that surround the
house. Martha gets tired and has to stop. She lies down
letting herself sink into the ground. Ingrid sits next to her.
Maybe she asks her if she’s okay.
MARTHA
This is too much… (catching her breath)
harder than I thought it would be. I need
to sit.
101
INGRID
Here, let me help you.
Martha half collapses and sits on the ground, lying back.
Ingrid helps her down.
MARTHA (CONT’D)
(Exhales) Ahhh. Much better.
When Martha manages to control her breathing, she says:
MARTHA (CONT’D)
Before coming out here I made a new will.
INGRID
Let’s not talk about this now.
MARTHA
I’m leaving the apartment and everything
in it to Michelle and you.
INGRID
I found your war journals at the house.
What do you want us to do with them?
(Pause) Is it okay if I read them?
MARTHA
Of course you can read them.
INGRID
Can I tell your story?
MARTHA
You can do what you want. I won’t be here.
Can I say that?
INGRID
No.
MARTHA
Okay.
102
87. IN THE MORNING. INGRID’S STUDY. INT. DAY
Ingrid is in her study. Her computer is open and she’s on the
phone, whispering. She’s talking to Damian.
INGRID
Let’s not talk about this now, okay? I’ll
meet you there.
CUT TO:
88. HOUSE IN THE WOODS. MARTHA’S ROOM. INT. DAY.
Martha has the door to her study open; her computer is on.
Ingrid is dressed and carries a sports bag. Martha, writes in
one of her notebooks… “Dear Ingrid, Today is such a beautiful
day that it seemed…” She hears Ingrid’s steps on the stairs
approaching her door. She stops writing and places the book
she was reading over the block of notes, covering her goodbye
letter. Outside it’s a beautiful day. Martha looks in good
spirits.
MARTHA
Hey.
INGRID
Hi. Everything okay?
MARTHA
(Smiling) Yeah. This breeze is delicious…
Between the open window/door that looks out on the garden and
the open door of the bedroom there is a slight breeze.
INGRID
Be careful, it’s a little chilly…
103
Martha looks round at her and smiles, as if telling her that
the cold can’t do anything to her now.
INGRID
So, if you don’t need me, I’m going to go
to the gym… But I can stay if you want.
Martha is relaxed.
MARTHA
No. Please, go out. I don’t wanna be a
downer.
INGRID
(Fondly) You’re not a downer. You’ve been
pretty well behaved.
MARTHA
Have you talked to your trainer about me?
INGRID
It came up. I told him about being in good
shape, when the body keeps fighting to
survive… what you told me in the hospital.
He looked at me like I was a lunatic, so I
told him I had a friend who was sick.
That’s all.
MARTHA
Remember you know nothing about anything.
Ingrid nods sadly.
MARTHA
Come here, give me a kiss.
104
Ingrid comes over. And she gives her a kiss on the cheek.
Martha holds her head with one hand so that the kiss lasts an
instant longer.
INGRID
Are you okay?
MARTHA
Yes.
Ingrid and Martha say goodbye to each other, and Ingrid exits.
89. AREA AROUND A RESTAURANT.
Ingrid comes into a restaurant, by a lake. A distinctive, open
place. She finds her ex, Damian Cunningham, waiting for her at
a table. They greet each other with a kiss and they sit down.
CUT TO:
90. RESTAURANT. INT. DAY.
There is food and drink on the table. Ingrid is worried.
INGRID
I lied to her. And I don’t like it.
DAMIAN
Well, you’ll have to practice.
INGRID
Lying?
DAMIAN
Yes. Officially you aren’t aware of
Martha’s intentions.
INGRID
Yeah.
105
DAMIAN
You should write a kind of script for
yourself and stick to it. I could help
you. And I’ve found a lawyer, in case you
need one.
INGRID
Thank you. Let’s not talk about it now.
How did your lecture go?
DAMIAN
Well, they weren’t too happy about my not
taking questions. In the end, people
started muttering, and someone called me a
coward. But it doesn’t bother me, I’ve
spent way too much time caring about my
reputation, and for what?
INGRID
So what are you doing with all that time
you’ve gotten back? Are you doing more of
what you like?
In the first part of the conversation Ingrid is still upset by
the image of her friend when she said goodbye to her in the
bedroom.
91. RESTAURANT. DAY.
DAMIAN
I must admit that my interest in things
has been shrinking as I get older.
INGRID
Martha said the same thing a couple days
ago… there are so few things left that she
can really enjoy.
106
She says it with real sadness, because she does still enjoy
reading, music, art, cinema.
DAMIAN
I understand her.
INGRID
Yeah, but you’re not sick.
DAMIAN
No, but I feel the same way, especially
after the pandemic. I don’t go to the
cinema, or listen to music… I read a lot,
but only subjects to do with my lectures…
INGRID
Don't you go to galleries? You used to
love that. When we were together we'd talk
about the power of art. Are you interested
in that at least?
DAMIAN
Even if every poet in the world sat down
to write a poem about the climate crisis,
it wouldn’t save one tree.
INGRID
Well, at least you’re interested in the
trees…
DAMIAN
I’m interested in sex too.
INGRID
Then you’re not so bad.
DAMIAN
(With a gesture of grief) Yes, I am. I
think a lot about sex, but I don’t have it
as much as I’d like. When I was young, if
a day went by without sex, I thought it
was incomplete…
107
INGRID
(With a smile) Yes, I remember that…
DAMIAN
I’m not nostalgic, but I miss the nights
when we’d drink, take drugs and have sex,
and all that didn’t distract us from what
we really wanted to do…
INGRID
You drank and you took drugs. Well, more
than I did anyway.
DAMIAN
I don’t know how much you drank but you
always acted like you were as blitzed as
the rest of us, but you were always an
essential part of the party. That is,
until you got bored and went off to
discover Europe. Do you want us to talk
about that?
INGRID
No…. Tell me about your lecture.
DAMIAN
I admit that I’ve become something of a
monomaniac… My own son is barely speaking
to me because I didn’t hide how appalled I
was that his wife was expecting another
child. He doesn’t want me anywhere near
her for fear she’ll have a miscarriage.
INGRID
(Reproachfully) How could you tell him
that they shouldn’t have another child!
DAMIAN
It’s their third!
INGRID
Well, so what would the next logical step
108
be? For people to start killing
themselves?
DAMIAN
People should be aware, once and for all,
of the state of the fucking planet they’re
living on! (Changing his tone)… Perhaps
this isn’t the best subject for you.
You’re living with a dying woman, in a
world that also agonizes.
INGRID
You really think the situation’s that
desperate?
She says it like a scared child.
DAMIAN
Yes. Yes, I do. Read the science and then
see what the world is doing with it…
They’re releasing more CO2 into the air
than ever before. Sooner or later, and I
fear it will be sooner, one day all this
will be shot to hell. And nothing’s going
to hasten the end of the planet more than
the survival of neo-liberalism and the
rise of the far right. And we have both of
them here, marching side by side… (He
looks at Ingrid, worried) I’m sorry, I
didn’t want to bring you down, but I get
riled up with all this.
INGRID
(Upset) You cannot go around saying
there’s no hope.
DAMIAN
It’s tragic and I guess it’s very
109
unpleasant of me to say so, but I have
completely lost faith in people doing the
right thing.
INGRID
I’m living expecting to find Martha’s body
in her bed any day. But that doesn’t stop
me from enjoying every minute with her,
just the opposite. I’m learning that from
her and you should too… There are lots of
ways to live inside of tragedy. Of course
it’s painful, it’s very painful but I've
accepted it. I’m living each moment with
the same joy she does, and with the same
appreciation. The last thing I need is to
hear a speech like yours.
Pause. Damian is struck by Ingrid’s natural goodness. By what
he has just heard.
DAMIAN
I’ve always admired you for that…
Ingrid looks at him, disconcerted.
INGRID
What?
DAMIAN
You’re one of the only people who knows
how to suffer without making others feel
guilty about it.
92. HOUSE IN THE WOODS. BATHROOM. INT. DAY
110
Martha is in the bathroom applying some subtle make-up. With a
little make-up, she manages to improve her appearance
considerably. She is still a beautiful woman.
CUT TO:
93. CONTINUOUS. KITCHEN.
Martha’s wearing a men’s yellow suit that fits her perfectly
without losing an iota of femininity. She looks like she’s
ready for a party. She enters the kitchen, opens the faucet
and serves herself a glass of water.
94. THEY WALK NEXT TO A LAKE. EXT. DAY
A splendid sunny day.
DAMIAN
Do you think it will be much longer?
INGRID
No, it’ll be soon. Any day now…
Suddenly, the idea that it could be happening at that moment
disturbs her.
DAMIAN
You have to be prepared. I know the
police. They’ll ask you all sorts of
questions, they’ll dig in your
relationship like scavengers. You need a
kind of mental script.
INGRID
I do have one. I’ve thought about it.
DAMIAN
Stick to it, and keep repeating the same
111
thing.
Ingrid nods.
DAMIAN
And when it happens, you should call the
police before you call me.
INGRID
I need to call her daughter. I should call
her before I call you.
DAMIAN
All right, but be careful what you say to
her. I had to tell the lawyer about the
situation.
Ingrid isn’t sure that so much anticipation is necessary.
INGRID
Why do we have to go through all this,
like we were criminals? Shouldn’t dying
people have the right to end their lives
with dignity?!
DAMIAN
They will, once our teetering health
system completely collapses.
95. INGRID’S CAR ARRIVES AT THE FRONT DOOR OF THE HOUSE IN THE
WOODS.
Ingrid parks where she usually does and goes up to the house.
She opens the door. Since half way through the meal, she has
had an odd premonition.
96. HOUSE IN THE WOODS. INT. DAY
112
Once inside, she goes to Martha’s room. The door is closed.
Ingrid senses that what had to happen has now happened. She
doesn’t even call out to her. Or perhaps she does, she
whispers Martha’s name, which sounds like a prayer.
INGRID
Martha…?
She doesn’t know what to do. Again, stupefaction, but she
remembers that it’s very important to do things properly.
Martha expects it of her.
97. CONTINUOUS.
She slowly opens the door of Martha’s room. And she goes in.
To her surprise, Martha isn’t inside. Martha’s body isn’t in
the bedroom. Ingrid, puzzled, walks around the room, the
bathroom. She is tempted to look under the bed. She doesn’t
understand what’s happening. She looks at the narrow table,
where she finds two envelopes. On one of the envelopes it says
“Ingrid”. On the other one it says “Police”. Ingrid exits the
room holding the envelope. We start to hear the contents of
the letter in a voice over.
98. CONTINUOUS
MARTHA (V.O.)
Dear Ingrid, today is such a beautiful day
that it seemed to me it was the moment to
leave. It consoled me that you weren’t in
the room downstairs, even though that was
the idea. But you know I always improvise
and I’m almost happy that, while I fade
away on the lounger, you’re out in the
113
world, experiencing something different to
my death. No one will be able to accuse
you of complicity. You have accompanied me
as much as any human being can accompany
another. The days we’ve spent together
have been like a love story. Remember me
like this. Call my daughter and tell her
I’m sorry. And thank you, love.
Now it is Ingrid who seems like a ghost, moving across the
interior of the house, looking left and right. Before arriving
to the door that leads to the garden she looks up at the trees
that extend out to the horizon. Did Martha choose to die in
contact with nature? Surrounded by trees?
She looks down at the lounge chairs which they lay in, taking
in the evening breeze. She looks at one of the tables with a
half empty glass of water on it. Martha, dressed in a yellow
suit and wearing make-up, is lying on the lounge chair next to
the table. The thick glass of the large trapezoidal window
separates them. Martha’s expression is serene. She looks like
she’s asleep.
Ingrid exits the house and approaches and contemplates Martha.
She doesn’t venture to touch her. She’s still carrying her
purse.
THE FOLLOWING IS AN ALTERNATIVE I WOULD LIKE TO TRY:
Ingrid looks at Martha and begins to speak with her, emotional
but serene. Ingrid has just received the most important lesson
of her entire life, recognizing and accepting death as it
presents itself. She’s standing before a beautifully dead
Martha, whom she finds the strength and courage to address.
114
INGRID
Oh, Martha… I’ll do everything as you
said.
She takes out her phone. She has to make a few phone calls.
Everything just as Martha had planned.
Fade to black.
99. POLICE STATION. QUESTIONING ROOM. INT. DAY.
The place is very simple, it looks like a storage room with a
metal table that feels like it was just placed there
happenstance with two chairs, facing each other. What little
furniture there is follows no logic. An inhospitable place.
Bare walls. The room has a metal storage shelf three feet
high.
Sitting, without saying a word, there is another officer. The
room is like a box, there isn’t a single window. A very
intimidating place.
Ingrid is being questioned by a hostile policeman, maybe of
Irish descent. There’s a camera in a corner of the ceiling.
The policeman is keeping up appearances but, under his
professional coldness, Ingrid senses that he’s judging and
condemning her.
Ingrid is tormented by grief, but she takes a deep breath and
gathers her strength. She thinks of Martha and that fortifies
her. It’s the second time he’s asked her the same questions.
POLICEMAN
What did you do the night before?
115
INGRID
We had dinner, and then we watched a
Buster Keaton movie. I told you all of
this already.
POLICEMAN
You didn’t notice anything strange,
anything that made you suspect? Try to
remember.
INGRID
I remember it perfectly, it was a fun
night…
She says it in a sad tone and remembers the real night, when
they saw the Buster Keaton film.
POLICEMAN
No gestures…? Nothing she said?
INGRID
We said goodnight. And then I went
upstairs and I stayed up late reading a
book that Martha had recommended… it’s
called Erotic Vagrancy… It’s about
Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton. Do
you know it?
POLICEMAN
No.
INGRID
Martha and I both thought it was a lot of
fun.
POLICEMAN
(Annoyed) Try to answer only the questions
I ask you…
They exchange hostile looks.
116
POLICEMAN (CONT’D)
What did you do the following morning?
INGRID
I had lunch with a friend… And then, when
I came back, I called out to her, and when
she didn’t answer, I went straight to her
bedroom, but she wasn’t there. So I went
out to the back yard, and that’s when I
saw her. At first, I thought she’d fallen
asleep on the lounge chair… I got very
nervous. I called the ambulance… They came
pretty quickly and, when the EMTs saw her,
they said there was nothing they could do.
Ingrid runs out of strength with the story.
INGRID
About what?
POLICEMAN
About her being in possession of this
illegal compound.
INGRID
No… I mean… I know she was taking
medication for the pain, but she never
shared specifics with me…
POLICEMAN
Nobody buys this pill by accident unless
they’re thinking of suicide or killing
someone.
Ingrid doesn’t say anything.
POLICEMAN (CONT’D)
So… it is strange, if the two of you were
117
such good friends, that she didn’t say
anything to you. Nobody can just walk into
a drugstore and buy this pill. It’s very
difficult to come by.
Ingrid makes a gesture of not knowing.
POLICEMAN (CONT’D)
I think that when she rented the house,
she already knew what she was going to do…
right?
INGRID
It’s very possible, but she didn’t tell me
about it. She was exhausted from the last
treatment, and she wanted to take a month
off before going back for the next round
of chemo… Martha wasn’t the type to throw
in the towel.
POLICEMAN
She didn’t complain? She didn’t say
anything that made you sense… the end?
It’s a great responsibility for you.
INGRID
She complained, sometimes…
POLICEMAN
What did she complain about? What did she
say?
INGRID
(With a great effort) She’d lost the
capacity for attention, she couldn’t read
or write… for example. Her life had been
reduced to surviving…
118
This information, so important at a human level, doesn’t
interest the policeman. He thinks that, somehow, Ingrid is
getting out of answering his questions by telling him the
opposite of what he expects.
POLICEMAN
(Fed up) I find it very hard to believe
she didn’t say anything… that made you
suspect the end.
INGRID
It was more than evident that she was very
sick, but Martha wanted to go on vacation
before going back to the hospital… I told
you this already.
Ingrid is tired. He speaks harshly to her.
POLICEMAN
We’ve also spoken to some of Martha’s
close friends. In general, they all
coincide with your testimony, but one of
them, Stella Byrne, told us that after
Martha finished her chemotherapy, she
proposed accompanying her to a house in
the country where she intended to commit
suicide. Asked her to, and I quote, “be in
the room next door”. And her friend
refused.
Ingrid is taken by surprise when he mentions Stella.
INGRID
(Steadfast, no longer hiding her anger) I
wasn’t in the room next door, I was in the
119
room downstairs.
As if he hadn’t even heard her:
POLICEMAN
When I spoke to Mrs. Byrne and informed
her of the suicide, she told me she wasn’t
surprised.
Ingrid looks at him, furious. And murmurs:
INGRID
There’s another word for Martha's death.
It’s called euthanasia.
POLICEMAN
Call it what you want, but for me what
your friend did is a crime, and as a
policeman, and as a human being, and as a
man of faith, I’m radically opposed to
anyone committing a crime, and of course,
anyone aiding and abetting in one.
100. CONTINUOUS.
With a stony expression, Ingrid takes her phone out of her
purse. Without consulting the policeman, she calls Damian. The
policeman doesn’t dare interrupt, as he’s stunned by her
attitude.
INGRID
Damian… could you come down to the police
station, please? This is endless.
POLICEMAN
How do you explain that your friend Martha
120
was so explicit with Mrs. Byrne and yet
she didn’t tell you anything about her
intentions?
INGRID
I’m not going to say another word. If I’m
under arrest, tell me what the charges
are… If not, I prefer to wait outside for
my lawyer.
POLICEMAN
Very foresighted of you! What made you
think you’d need a lawyer?
Ingrid stands up, hardened, unworried. She feels Martha
inspiring her and giving her newfound strength.
INGRID
Ask your colleague, he witnessed the
interrogation.
Ingrid looked at the assistant policeman reminding him that,
indeed, he has witnessed the other policeman’s excesses. The
assistant looks at her, surprised, he wasn’t expecting to be
included.
POLICEMAN
I think you’re lying. And that you’re the
kind of person who wouldn’t say no if a
friend asked you for help committing
suicide.
Ingrid heads for the door. The police second police officer
gestures to the first “what do I do?”.
POLICEMAN
121
Let her go.
The second policeman opens the door and Ingrid leaves the
interrogation room.
101. POLICE STATION. MAIN CORRIDOR. INT. – DAY
Ingrid appears in a large central corridor, with the walls
covered in corporative photos and insignias. She recovers her
breath. She sits on a wooden bench.
Next to the photos and various shields hung on the wall,
standing out in a large frame is the motto “Honor, Integrity,
Pride”. This motto is repeated in various parts of the
corridor. Next to the bench there is a display window with
memorabilia from the police corps. All kinds of objects, from
a folded jacket, guns, various laminated press articles, and
red plastic sirens.
CUT TO:
102. CORRIDOR, POLICE STATION. INT. DAY
Damian arrives, accompanied by a lawyer. They find Ingrid in
the corridor, sitting on the wooden bench. As soon as she sees
them, she gets up and goes over to them. Damian hugs her and
introduces the lawyer. Ingrid is upset, after the difficult
encounter with the policeman, but she doesn’t seem fragile.
Martha’s transmitted her strength.
DAMIAN
Hi, are you ok? (Presenting the lawyer)
This is my lawyer, Sarah.
122
Sarah tries to set Ingrid at ease.
LAWYER
Damian’s filled me in. Is there anything I
should know about the interrogation?
INGRID
(Indignant) He treated me like I was the
killer.
DAMIAN
But you were with me!
INGRID
He doesn’t care… (to the lawyer) He
insists that I’m implicated. He spoke to a
friend of Martha’s, Stella Byrne, who had
refused to help her…
LAWYER
(Caught off guard) Okay… well, I’m sure
everything was recorded…
INGRID
Yes… And this police officer (she points
to the assistant who is coming towards
them) witnessed everything.
ASSISTANT
(Approaching them, to Ingrid) You can come
in now.
LAWYER
I’ll go in alone. I’m her attorney. (To
Ingrid) Don’t worry, this is all very
clear.
103. STREET POLICE STATION. EXT. DAY
Ingrid, Damian and the lawyer walk out of the police station.
LAWYER
123
(To Ingrid) Jesus! What an asshole! I’ve
never been treated like that before! You
were unlucky to come up against a
religious fanatic… Anyway, he’s not going
to bother you again. I’m going to file a
complaint.
INGRID
Thank you so much.
LAWYER
You still have to be available for the
next forty-eight hours, until the forensic
formalities are done. I told them to call
me if necessary.
INGRID
I’ll be at the house. Do you have all the
information you need?
LAWYER
Yes, Damian gave it to me. I’m going to
head back to the office… just… call me if
you need anything… (she shakes Ingrid's
hand) I’m really sorry for your loss.
INGRID
(Shaking her hand) Thank you.
DAMIAN
(Shaking her hand) Thank you, Sarah.
Sarah exits.
CUT TO:
104. POLICE PARKING LOT. EXT.
INGRID
(To Damian) I can’t believe that Stella
124
told him that!
DAMIAN
He probably cornered her. And they have
Martha’s computer, and her cell phone. Do
you know if they talked?
INGRID
Not that I know, she didn’t tell me
anything.
Ingrid takes a deep breath, as if she has just awakened from a
nightmare.
DAMIAN
What do you want to do?
INGRID
I need to go back to the house. I still
have to pack up Martha’s things.
Her phone rings. It’s Michelle, Martha’s daughter. Ingrid
looks first at the caller ID. She looks at Damian. We don’t
hear the voice of the person calling, but it really shocks
Ingrid when she answers.
INGRID
Yes, speaking. (To Damian) It’s Michelle…
DAMIAN
Martha’s daughter.
INGRID
Yes… Of course you can come… I’m headed
there now… I’ll text you the address… See
you soon.
125
Ingrid is nervous and thrilled at the idea of meeting
Michelle. Damian and Ingrid say their goodbyes with a hug and
a kiss. Ingrid looks at him, grateful.
DAMIAN
Well, I’m headed back to the city… Let me
know when you’re back and I’ll help you
with your move.
INGRID
(Sincere) Thank you for everything. I’ll
call you.
Damian stands next to Ingrid’s car while she opens the door
and gets in. She starts the engine.
105. HOUSE IN THE WOODS. NEW ENGLAND. EXT. DAY.
Ingrid parks the rental car where she usually does. She’s left
the door open to a walkway we never see. Outside the gate, she
hears a car stop for a few seconds and then drive away. Ingrid
gets out of her car and walks halfway down the driveway where
she meets Michelle, who is coming towards her.
Michelle is the spitting image of Martha twenty years younger,
and with a different hairdo. She’s tall and thin like Martha.
Both women greet each other. Ingrid doesn’t try to hide her
emotion.
MICHELLE
Hello, I’m Michelle.
INGRID
I’m Ingrid.
Ingrid gets teary-eyed. Michelle smiles. She likes Ingrid.
126
INGRID
Let’s go inside.
106. HOUSE IN THE WOODS. INTERIOR AND EXTERIOR. DAY
The two women go into the house, they look around as if the
house were a living person. Michelle admires the architecture
and the woods that surround the house.
Ingrid points to Martha’s room, the door is open. She is still
emotional, but she covers it well. To Michelle:
INGRID
Do you want to see your mother’s room?
MICHELLE
Yes, please.
Michelle goes into her mother’s room. She stops to
see the bed and goes down the three steps.
Ingrid looks at Michelle and her shadow on the red
door of Martha’s room and, emotional, continues
looking at the shadow which disappears into the
bedroom.
CUT TO:
107. KITCHEN. HOUSE IN THE WOODS. INT. DAY.
Ingrid starts to boil water to make coffee. She takes out two
mugs and some cookies, as she did with Martha, and fills them
with coffee. One of the mugs is the one Martha used. Michelle
comes into the kitchen.
127
INGRID
I made some coffee.
MICHELLE
Thank you.
Of the two mugs, Michelle chooses the one that her mother used
before. Maybe they feel her, while they drink.
MICHELLE
Did she tell you about me?
INGRID
Of course she did. And she told me that
you were very upset about not having met
your father.
INGRID
So, she told you about my father?
INGRID
She did.
MICHELLE
Don’t you think she should have helped him
when he came back from the war?
It’s a question she would have liked to ask her mother, or
perhaps she did so.
INGRID
She helped him as best she could. Your
father came back badly damaged. He wanted
to live in another city and start a new
life. His plans didn’t include Martha or
you.
Michelle listens carefully, receptive.
128
INGRID (CONT’D)
And your mother accepted the end of their
relationship. She just saw him in such a
bad way that she kissed him to give him
some peace. And that kiss turned into
something more. You are the fruit of that
moment.
Michelle listens very closely to her and remains silent.
Obviously she’d never looked at the situation from that angle.
And her early hostility prevented her mother telling her about
it in any detail.
MICHELLE
(Puzzled) My mother never told me anything
about that.
INGRID
It is a difficult thing to explain to a
child.
MICHELLE
(Without bitterness) She could have done
it later.
INGRID
By then you were so estranged that it
wasn't possible anymore. Your mother was a
teenager and she had a life to live… And
your father went to San Diego and he made
no effort to know you.
CUT TO:
Michelle and Ingrid are sitting at the table. Michelle is
eating some cookies.
129
MICHELLE
So, Ingrid, do you think I was totally
mistaken about Martha?
INGRID
You were very unfair, but no one can blame
you for wanting to know who your father
was… It’s a very sad story… very painful
for both of you.
Michelle nods her head. Her attitude has changed. She is an
adult who admits that she was mistaken all her childhood. She
looks at Ingrid, grateful.
INGRID
Don’t be too hard on yourself… Martha
wasn’t a perfect mother.
MICHELLE
(Without resentment) No, she wasn’t… Can I
stay here tonight?
INGRID
Of course! This is your mother’s house.
CUT TO:
108. INGRID’S OFFICE. INT. NIGHT
Ingrid turns on her computer and starts writing. “Dear Martha,
I thought you’d like to know I have come back to the house in
the woods to gather up your things. Your daughter came to see
me, I’m still shaking, she looks so like you. She asked me if
she could stay and sleep in your bed, and of course I said
yes. I think your death has brought her closer to you. I never
thought I’d inherit her, even if it’s just for a day. The
house is filled with you. When I came in after talking to the
130
police, the first thing I saw was the door of your room… and
it was open. And I said to myself, “she’s alive”.
109. HOUSE IN THE WOODS. IN ONE OF THE OFFICES. DAWN.
The dawn surprises Ingrid still writing on her computer. She
hears in the distance the first trills of the birds. She has
been awake all night. She has a mug of coffee beside her, on
the desk.
Suddenly, she hears noises. She looks up from the text she’s
writing and her eyes shine. The noises are coming from
Martha’s room.
Michelle walks around the living room like a ghost. She’s
wearing one of the gowns Martha used to wear. She has the same
hairstyle. Ingrid sees her in the reflection of her office
window. For Ingrid, it’s a vision, a mirage. She stands
motionless, expectant. The woman in the nightdress walks to
the door leading to the garden and opens it. The birds can now
be heard singing more loudly when the door opens. Ingrid walks
over in her direction.
110. GARDEN. FACING THE WOODS. EXT. DAWN.
When Ingrid exits the house into the garden, she’s
hypersensitive and finding Michelle wearing Martha’s clothes
and sitting on the lounger listening to the birds sing like
Martha used to do heightens that emotion. She lays on the
other lounger like she used to do with her friend. Ingrid’s
emotion will grow subtly from here. It’s a genuine emotion,
simple, without any added agitation or melodrama, that will
culminate with the falling snow.
131
MICHELLE
I came out to listen to the birds…
INGRID
Your mother would come out like this, at
dawn, and lie right there, to listen to
them too.
Michelle looks at her, slightly affected by Ingrid’s emotional
state. She has the sensation that she’ll be able to ask Ingrid
everything she never asked her mother. Ingrid is going to
become, in a very non obvious way, the mother she never had.
Michelle is a living replica of Martha, but it is Ingrid who
will end up transforming into Martha… she has inherited her
strength, as she’s demonstrated in her tough encounter with
the police officer.
It suddenly starts to snow. Ingrid looks on, marveled by the
miraculous sight.
MICHELLE
Look, it’s snowing.
(This sounds the same as when Martha said it in the hospital.
Before the two women we see the miraculous snow falling on the
trees in the forest, over the house and on them. In this
moment is when Ingrid is most clearly Martha, or a mixture of
herself and Martha. With tears burning her eyes, she murmurs
with the same rhythm Martha did it in the hospital, and then
again while lying in Ingrid’s lap in the living room of the
house while they watched The Dead, like a prayer, what the
falling snow provoked in her. They are not James Joyce’s
words, but they should sound the same and invoke the same
sentiment, even more intense perhaps, as Ingrid is talking
about her magical time with Martha in the house in the woods,
132
and is sitting next to a daughter identical to Martha, who is
also fascinated and moved by the emotion.)
INGRID
(Her eyes filled with tears) The snow is
falling… It’s falling on the lonely pool
we never used… It’s falling on the woods
where we walked and you lay exhausted on
the ground. Falling on your daughter and
on me, falling upon the living and the
dead.
Ingrid is crying, softly, releasing. Michelle looks at her,
curious, also emotional. She doesn’t understand why Ingrid is
crying, but she senses it… or at least she doesn’t find it
strange. And without even realizing, she begins to love
Ingrid.
The end.
