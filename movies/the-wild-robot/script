DISSOLVE to a darker version. Storm clouds blanket the
moon, PULSING with lightning.
Sounds of the storm build in ferocity and volume, the
thunder reaches a crescendo.
SMASH TO:
SQ0200 - THE ROBOT HATCHES
EXT. DESERTED BEACH - DAWN
Blinding daylight, silent save for ocean ripples lapping
at a soft stone beach. The sky and shoreline are
distorted as if viewed through a wide lens. SLOW PULL-OUT
reveals a rugged coast reflected on the rounded lens of a
robot, ROZZUM 7134. WIDEN to reveal the Rozzum peers from
a rupture in a mostly intact shipping crate.
Otters gather, investigating the curiosity. One POKES at
the back of the robot’s head, accidentally ACTIVATING it.
ROZZUM 7134
Hello. Bonjour. Guten tag. Hujambo. Hola.
Congratulations on your purchase of a
Universal Dynamics robot. I am Rozzum
seven-one-three-four. A Rozzum always
completes its task, just ask!
Silence. ROZZUM 7134 blinks.
ROZZUM 7134 (CONT’D)
Just, ask--
Rozzum 7134 is BLINDSIDED by a wave. Rolled under the
brine, it is driven like a toy against a basalt wall.
The wave RECEDES, leaving 7134 to drain. Another wave
LOOMS.
ROZZUM 7134 (CONT’D)
Processing.
Rozzum 7134 attempts to climb to safety, SLIPS. Rozzum
7134 notes a crab scuttling up the rock wall.
2.
She RECONFIGURES to match the crab’s stance. Rozzum 7134
successfully climbs clear.
EXT. CLIFFTOP - MOMENTS LATER
The crab clambers into view, followed by Rozzum 7134.
ROZZUM VISION: “CUSTOMER LOCATED?”
ROZZUM 7134
Do you need--
The crab is SNATCHED away by a passing gull.
ROZZUM 7134 (CONT’D)
...assistance?
Rozzum 7134 FOCUSES on a wall of thick vegetation before
it: deploys sound gathering arrays.
Rozzum 7134 COCKS its head, listening: animal and bird
sounds drift through the curtain of greenery.
ROZZUM 7134 (CONT’D)
Ready to receive my first task.
Rozzum 7134 pushes into the forest.
SQ0250 - THE FOREST
EXT. ISLAND FOREST - DAY
ON A RAVEN landing in the branches of a tree. He PAUSES,
an unfamiliar sound approaching; MUSIC.
LOOKING DOWN he sees Rozzum 7134 making her way through
the trees. Her upper body ROTATING cheerily.
ROZZUM 7134
Rozzum Seven One Three Four is available
for task assignment.
A LYNX PEERS at the passing oddity.
ROZZUM 7134 (CONT’D)
Rozzum robots come standard with the
Alpha-113 dimensional processor.
Rozzum 7134 PASSES through the trees.

ROZZUM 7134 (CONT’D)
If you are unsure about how I can
assist, try asking me about myself.
On Rozzum 7134 navigating a tilted log in an attempt to
communicate with a BADGER.
ROZZUM 7134 (CONT’D)
Excuse me! Did you know I can
assist with grocery shopping?
Banking? Landscaping?
The badger burrows away. 7134 spies a squirrel PEERING
DOWN from its tree house.
ROZZUM 7134 (CONT’D)
Hello! Did you perhaps order a Rozzum
helper robot?
7134 is PELTED with acorns.
ROZZUM 7134 (CONT’D)
Is that a no?
Rozzum 7134 FLASHES the squirrel unexpectedly with a
chest strobe, BLINDING it. A little WHIRRING sound as a
sticker is dispensed from a small slit in 7134’s chest.
ROZZUM 7134 (CONT’D)
Here’s a free sticker. Scan the code and
receive ten percent off of your--
The squirrel RIPS UP the sticker.
ON A BEAVER, PADDLER, finishing a modest dam. He hears
weird music. Spies 7134 WALKING PAST like Bigfoot. 7134
PAUSES, RUNS toward Paddler.
ROZZUM 7134 (CONT’D)
Do you need assistance?
He’s PETRIFIED.
ROZZUM 7134 (CONT’D)
I see your problem.
Rozzum 7134 PULLS a key branch. The entire dam collapses -
is washed away.
FLASH! 7134 generates a sticker for Paddler, who
disappears under the water.
ON A DEER BOUNDING through the meadow.
3.
4.
Rozzum 7134 RECONFIGURES TO EMULATE THE DEER’S LEAPS.
ROZZUM 7134 (CONT’D)
(LEAPING up alongside)
Rozzums are programmed for instant
physical mimicry, so as to--
The deer VEERS. KICKS Rozzum 7134.
A BUTTERFLY FLITS past her lenses.
Rozzum 7134 APPROACHES a tree surfaced in butterflies.
ALL the insects FLY at once. Surrounded in a cloud of
color and movement, Rozzum 7134 is disoriented.
A butterfly LANDS on her finger.
A RAVEN lands, CRUSHES the butterfly in its beak.
A Lynx LEAPS from cover, ATTACKING the raven on 7134’s
hand. Rozzum 7134 EXTENDS her arm a bit, distancing her
head from the savage battle at the end of her arm.
ROZZUM 7134 (CONT’D)
Aggression detected.
A wolverine GRABS the other half of the dead raven, a
savage TUG-OF-WAR over its body.
The raven’s head POPS off and lands in 7134’s hand.
ROZZUM 7134 (CONT’D)
My communication package includes
strategies for conflict resolution.
The fight is ESCALATING quickly. Dust OBSCURES the scene.
A skunk, DAISY, rumbles into the fray. The fight is
instantly quenched, the aggressors FLEE. 7134 PICKS UP
the skunk.
The skunk BERATES 7134 savagely.
ROZZUM 7134 (CONT’D)
Your dialect is not in my databanks.
7134 places the skunk back on the ground.
ROZZUM 7134 (CONT’D)
Tell your people not to worry. Rozzum
7134 will sort out this language barrier
in no time.
4.
5.
The skunk SPRAYS. The noxious cloud ENVELOPS 7134.
EXT. FOREST - LATER
CLOSE ON 7134’S HEAD - she is sitting very still.
ROZZUM 7134
Activating learning mode.
PULL BACK, revealing we are in TIME LAPSE. Nights and
days pass, with a multitude of animals stopping by. Rain
falls, leaves litter her. Rozzum 7134 never moves. A WEEK
passes, leaves gathering on her exterior. Animals ignore
her, go about their business. 7134’s processor GRINDS
AWAY. DING!
ROZZUM VISION: TRANSLATION COMPLETE
WEASEL 2
Hey, check it out. Look, look, look.
Somebody died over here.
WEASEL 3
Lemme see, lemme see. Oooh.
WEASEL 2
Who was it?
WEASEL 1
Anybody we know?
WEASEL 2
Fresh or not fresh?
WEASEL 1
Smells pretty good.
WEASEL 2
Tastes terrible.
WEASEL 3
Oh, it’s waking up! Run!
WEASEL 2
Hey it’s waking up!
WEASEL 1
It’s a monster! Run for your lives!
Rozzum 7134 RISES, brushing debris off of herself.
5.
6.
EXT. CLEARING - LATER.
A multitude of animals graze, forage, flit here and
there. They all STOP. Rozzum 7134 strides out into the
open.
PADDLER
Look! That’s the thing that destroyed my
dam.
ANIMALS
The monster! Yikes! I think it’s gonna
talk.
ROZZUM 7134
Thank you for your patience while I
deciphered your language. I am Rozzum
seven one three four, ready to enhance
your lives with integrated multi-phased
task accomplishment.
A SUPER CUTE bunny baby HOPS UP.
BABY BUNNY
Are you here to kill us?
ROZZUM 7134
Negative, I am here to help with whatever
tasks you-
BABY BUNNY
(to the crowd)
It says no.
BROADFOOT (O.S.)
*SNORT*
Roz is RUN DOWN by a huge moose, BROADFOOT.
BROADFOOT (CONT’D)
It’s dead.
ANIMAL CROWD
Oh, thank goodness.
7134 RISES AGAIN, like a haunted marionette.
REELING IN her arms and legs: the sight is weird,
unsettling.
ANIMAL CROWD (CONT’D)
AAAAAAAAAAUGHHHHHHHHH. The monster!
The animals SCATTER. Rozzum 7134 is left alone.
6.
7.
ROZZUM 7134
Did anyone order me?
EXT. MOUNTAIN PEAK - DUSK
Rozzum 7134 has a 360 degree view. ORBIT to describe an
island: no other land or structures in sight. She’s
TRAPPED on an ISLAND.
ROZZUM 7134
...anyone?
No responses.
ROZZUM 7134 (CONT’D)
Delivery unsuccessful. Return to factory.
Activating return transmitter.
From Rozzum 7134’s head, a greenish rod RISES - the
TRANSMITTER.
A DOWNPOUR STRIKES. Rozzum 7134 POWERS UP the
transmitter. It LIGHTS as the charge builds:
red...yellow...GREEN!
ROZZUM 7134 (CONT’D)
Three, two, one--
BOOM! Rozzum 7134 is hit by lightning. She FALLS from the
summit.
SQ0600 - THE ACCIDENT
EXT. FOREST - NIGHT
ON ROZZUM 7134 lying motionless and dark.
ROZZUM VISION: OVER A BLACK SCREEN
- “SYSTEM BOOTING.
ACCESS PANEL BREACH. PANEL 10 OPEN. PANEL 28 OPEN. PANEL
11, 51, 32 OPEN.”
Rozzum 7134 POWERS UP. Her eye covers CLICK open to
reveal--
She is missing an eye and a hand.
ON HER TORSO - a multitude of access panels flap open.
PAN to find the ground is strewn with paper manuals,
small tools. TILT UP to find raccoons making off with
Rozzum 7134’s stuff.
7.
8.
Lightning FLASHES. Rozzum 7134 hurries to retrieve all
her lost items. As quickly as she can gather them, other
raccoons try and take them back.
In one tug-of-war, a raccoon accidentally UNPLUGS a black
box. Its exposed contacts SIZZLE with power, and Rozzum
7134 is ZAPPED.
Understanding the power he yields, the raccoon GRINS and
runs off with his new weapon.
Feeling overwhelmed, Rozzum 7134 tries DEPLOYING her
transmitter again.
ROZZUM 7134
Activating return transmitter. Three.
RACCOONS
Ooooooh.
RACCOONS (CONT’D)
Pretty.
RACCOONS (CONT’D)
Get it.
ROZZUM 7134
Two...
Attracted to the shiny transmitter, the raccoons SWARM
Rozzum 7134 to get to it.
ROZZUM 7134 (CONT’D)
One...
One raccoon manages to POP it out.
RACCOON
Ha!
The raccoon heads STRAIGHT UP A PINE, CHASED by the
raccoon hoard and Rozzum 7134.
RACCOONS
Come back.
They near the top - the tree BENDING under their weight.
Arcing down, the top of the tree lands on a rocky ledge.
RACCOON
Wait, stop! No!
Rozzum 7134 STANDS and CHASES after the transmitter.
8.
9.
RACCOONS
No no no no no!
Releasing the tree top from her weight, the tree trunk
SNAPS back upright, FLINGING a hundred raccoons into the
night sky. They splash down in the ocean.
RACCOON
Again!
The raccoon with the transmitter DISAPPEARS into a cave.
Moments later he RETREATS, WITHOUT the transmitter.
Rozzum 7134 REACHES INTO the cave to retrieve it, but a
huge grizzly, THORN, STEPS over it.
THORN
(sfx)
Growling.
Thorn STRIKES Rozzum 7134 mid-chest. Claws dig deep
grooves - SPARKS FLY from her seams.
Rozzum 7134 RETREATS, power intermittent. Thorn closes.
ROZZUM VISION: A confusion of trees punctuated by
blinding lightning flashes.
Rozzum 7134 BUMPS into a tree. She SLIPS, TUMBLING CLEAR
of Thorn, heading downhill, knocking small trees flat.
Rozzum 7134 lays still, tangled in branches, caked with
mud. Dwindling rain PATS her metal body.
7134 OPENS her main panel. Inside are equivalents of
bones, arteries, lungs, and a heart. Everything GLOWS
with tracing energy save for the heart, which is dark.
Rozzum 7134 TAPS it. A few PULSES, then nothing.
7134 CLOSES the panel, finds a feather stuck to the
outside. Examining it, she sees a similar spray of
feathers peeking through the debris beneath her. She
gently grasps them, pulling a limp wing into view. Death
is abstract to Rozzum 7134, she shows no emotion.
Letting go of the wing, she carefully wipes away the
branches to reveal a group of SHATTERED EGG SHELLS.
7134 lifts shell fragments, pieces them together. Then
something catches her gaze...Rozzum 7134 moves some
leaves away to REVEAL... ONE INTACT EGG.
ROZZUM VISION: Infrared scan reveals a living bird
within.
9.
10.
She lifts it, very carefully indeed.
SQ0700 - THE EGG AND THE FOX
EXT. HOLLOW - MOMENTS LATER
Rozzum 7134 sits, considering the egg and her
transmitter.
7134 GLANCES away, looks back to find the egg is GONE.
The dense foliage RUSTLES as something small makes their
escape.
ROZZUM VISION: Switching to INFRARED Rozzum 7134 locates
the creature, gives CHASE.
ROZZUM 7134
May I confirm that is yours?
The egg is with a red fox, FINK. He is wily and slick.
Even when 7134 gets him by the tail, he slithers free.
Fink shelters in a log. 7134 SPLITS IT with a SAW. She
retrieves the egg, STASHES it in a storage compartment.
Fink PRIES OPEN a back panel, RECOVERS his EGG.
Fink rockets into a thicket, an EVIL GRIN on his face.
Rozzum 7134 closes: the brush abruptly CLEARS and Rozzum
7134 FALLS off the edge of a cliff.
Fink strides out on a limb, satisfied: he drew Rozzum
7134 here deliberately. Rozzum 7134’s cabled hand SHOOTS
UP and GRASPS the limb. Rozzum 7134 REELS IN her extended
arm. VAULTING OVER Fink, she lands back on the cliff
edge.
Surprised, cut off on the branch and out of options, Fink
RELINQUISHES the egg.
FINK
Here you go. Take it.
As Rozzum 7134 reaches for the egg, Fink SWALLOWS it.
Rozzum 7134 GRABS Fink by the neck, SQUEEZES the egg out
of him. The egg FLIES over Rozzum 7134’s head. Fink
DASHES between her legs, LEAPS, CATCHES the egg mid-air,
and then LANDS straight on top of a porcupine.
Fink DROPS the egg. Rozzum 7134 recovers it intact.
10.
11.
The porcupine RETREATS, leaving Fink to deal with a face-
full of quills. He’s unable to dislodge even one.
To his surprise, Rozzum 7134 PICKS HIM UP, and quickly
uses a tool to pluck the quills out.
She sets him back down.
Fink SNARLS and dashes for cover.
SQ0800 - THE EGG HATCHES
EXT. DEEP FOREST - LATER
ON ROZZUM 7134, a RATTLING from her interior. She removes
the egg. Examines it.
‘CRACK’ - the egg has a HAIRLINE RUPTURE.
Rozzum 7134 gently PINCHES the shell to close it up. More
cracks form. Rozzum 7134 FRANTICALLY tries to hold it all
together. For a moment, it works.
The egg EXPLODES. A tiny gosling sits in Rozzum 7134’s
palm.
GOSLING
Peep?
The new gosling LOOKS UP, into Rozzum 7134’s glowing blue
eyes. Something wordlessly passes between them. The
gosling places his forehead against Rozzum 7134. Her
subsurface lights GLOW powerfully.
The magic moment is interrupted when 7134 callously
PLUCKS UP the gosling, sets it back on the ground.
ROZZUM 7134
Was this task accomplished to your
satisfaction?
The gosling SCREAMS. FLASH. Rozzum 7134 STICKS a sticker
to his chest.
ROZZUM 7134 (CONT’D)
On a scale of one to ten where ten is
most satisfied and one is least, how
would you rate my performance?
GOSLING
Peep.
11.
12.
Rozzum 7134 hands the gosling a sticker.
ROZZUM 7134
I will register that as a ‘ten’.
Rozzum 7134 attempts to activate her transmitter.
ROZZUM 7134 (CONT’D)
Returning to factory.
The transmitter BLINKS, unstable.
ROZZUM 7134 (CONT’D)
Signal strength weak. Seeking higher
ground.
Rozzum 7134 STRIDES AWAY.
GOSLING
*peep peep peep*
The gosling RACES after her. For every step Rozzum 7134
takes, the gosling must dash thirty or more.
ROZZUM 7134
Do you require shelter?
Rozzum 7134 covers the gosling with a piece of wood. As
she walks, the wood TRAILS behind 7134.
Rozzum 7134 STRIDES into the forest. The gosling HOPS
onto her foot, riding along. Roz stops, a DING! Her
center compartment opens.
ROZZUM 7134 (CONT’D)
Perhaps tips for planning your next
vacation?
She sets a travel pamphlet on the ground: FLORIDA - MORE
SHORELINE THAN EVER - and continues on her way. The
gosling FALLS DOWN A HOLE. Moments later, the gosling
TODDLES out onto a branch beside Rozzum 7134, HOPPING
ONTO her shoulder. The gosling SNUGGLES under Rozzum
7134’s chin.
ROZZUM 7134 (CONT’D)
I do not understand this response.
Rozzum 7134’s transmitter lights up.
ROZZUM 7134 (CONT’D)
Signal acquired. Three, two, one--
The gosling PECKS the transmitter. BREAKS it.
12.
13.
BABY OPOSSUM 1(OS)
Mom, I don’t feel good.
SQ1000 - THE TASK
A rustling in the brush. Roz INVESTIGATES, sees a opossum
mother, PINKTAIL, with four baby opossums on her back.
BABY OPOSSUM 1
If I barf, I’m taking you all with me.
BABY OPOSSUM 2
Mom told you not to eat grasshoppers,
dummy.
BABY OPOSSUM 3
Petunia’s been in front all day.
BABY OPOSSUM 4
The prettiest opossum always rides in
front.
BABY OPOSSUM 3
Try being pretty with my tail jammed in
your eye.
Rozzum 7134’s hand SETS the gosling on the back of
Pinktail.
BABY OPOSSUMS
(blood-curdling)
EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEK.
Pinktail STANDS, SPILLING the babies.
PINKTAIL
Bartlett, stop jamming your tail in your
sister’s eye.
BABY OPOSSUM 4
I’m Rowan. Bartlett was last litter.
PINKTAIL
Are you sure? Who are all of you? Go
away.
BABY OPOSSUM 4
We’re your children. Except for him.
GOSLING
*Peep*
13.
14.
Pinktail is astonished to see her brood has grown by one.
PINKTAIL
This is what I get for taking a walk.
Where’s your mommy, little guy?
Pinktail notices Roz PEERING at them.
PINKTAIL (CONT’D)
The monster. AAAAAAAAAAAUGHHHHHHH.
Pinktail and the babies KEEL OVER.
BABY OPOSSUM 5
(dramatic)
*cough cough*
BABY OPOSSUM 4
(whisper)
You gotta die faster.
BABY OPOSSUM 5
Meningitis takes a while.
BABY OPOSSUM 6
What did you pick?
BABY OPOSSUM 7
Rabies.
BABY OPOSSUM 8
Spontaneous combustion!
BABY OPOSSUM 4
Nightshade salad.
BABY OPOSSUM 9
Sepsis.
BABY OPOSSUMS
Hey! I picked sepsis!
PINKTAIL
None of you are doing it right. We talked
about this. Dead things don’t have to
explain why they’re dead. Now we’re gonna
get killed for real.
BABY OPOSSUMS
(together)
Sorry mom.
14.
15.
BABY OPOSSUM
(a beat late)
Sorry.
Beat.
BABY OPOSSUM 4
Why aren’t we killed yet?
PINKTAIL
Good question.
Pinktail parts the foliage to investigate. Roz has rolled
away. The gosling scampers up and PERCHES on Rozzum
7134’s shoulder. The sight emboldens Pinktail to crawl up
to investigate.
BABY OPOSSUM 2
Nice knowing you, mom.
PINKTAIL
(to the gosling)
Alright, it’s ok. It’s ok.
Pinktail PEERS into Rozzum 7134’s body cavity.
PINKTAIL (CONT’D)
Uh, hey. You in there? I’m Pinktail.
Rozzum 7134’s head partially emerges from her body.
PINKTAIL (CONT’D)
Ok. Hello. This gosling is yours?
BABY OPOSSUM 3
Wow.
Rozzum 7134 hands the gosling back to Pinktail.
ROZZUM 7134
Negative. That gosling stalks me, emits
noise, and makes simple tasks more
complicated or impossible.
PINKTAIL
Yeah, they do that. Goslings imprint on
the first thing they see. Which would be
you.
BABY OPOSSUM 6
Congratulations.
15.
16.
PINKTAIL
As far as he’s concerned, you’re his
mother now.
ROZZUM 7134
I do not have the programming to be a
mother.
Rozzum 7134 walks away.
BABY OPOSSUMS (O.S.)
It’s gonna squish us!
Pinktail ambushes her, DROPPING down from a branch.
PINKTAIL
No one does. We just make it up.
ROZZUM 7134
Without an assigned task, my next
priority is to return to factory.
PINKTAIL
Taking care of him is your task now.
Pinktail said the magic word: TASK. A CHIME sounds. MUSIC
PLAYS. Tracer lights activate:
ROZZUM 7134
Task acquired. Return mode delayed. A
Rozzum always completes its task.
As Pinktail talks, her babies BITE, CHEW, and FIGHT with
each other. The mother opossum uses her prehensile tail
to separate them, smack them, etc.
PINKTAIL
You’re lucky you just have one. As a
mother of seven--
BABY OPOSSUM (O.S.)
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUGHHHHHH.
PINKTAIL
...Six babies, it’s a full time thing.
She picks up one of the babies.
PINKTAIL (CONT’D)
But it’s not all bad.
The baby BARFS up a hairball.
16.
17.
PINKTAIL (CONT’D)
Just mostly bad.
ROZZUM 7134
Do you have any information on how to
take care of this unit?
PINKTAIL
They all need to eat. But yours needs to
swim, and fly. Fly by fall. He’s gotta
leave this island before winter, or, how
do I put this delicately?
BABY OPOSSUMS
Aaaaaaaughhhhh.
The opossum babies all FEIGN GRISLY DEATH.
PINKTAIL
Yeah. That.
ROZZUM 7134
Eat. Swim. Fly by fall. Or aaaaugh.
PINKTAIL
Patience is the key.
A CHEWED UP baby appears.
BABY OPOSSUM 4
It’s okay mom, I’m alive.
PINKTAIL (O.S.)
(flat)
Oh. Yay. Well, good luck.
Babies CLIMB ONTO Pinktail’s back. Pinktail walks away.
BABY OPOSSUMS
Goodbye. We like your new baby. Hope it
doesn’t die.
SQ1100 - THE HUNGRY GOSLING
EXT. MEADOW - MORNING
Rozzum 7134 PROJECTS images of people EATING, diagram of
a person SWIMMING and a Jet aircraft FLYING.
ROZZUM 7134
Eat. Swim. Fly by fall.
17.
18.
Her gaze DRIFTS from the image to focus on the gosling on
her shoulder.
FINK’S POV - watching Rozzum 7134 and the gosling.
CUT TO:
EXT. GLEN - LATER
Rozzum 7134 holds a pinecone in one hand, the gosling in
the other.
ROZZUM 7134
Eat.
She tries to plug the pinecone into the gosling’s mouth.
It is FAR too big.
FINK
Huh.
EXT. PONDSIDE - LATER
ON THE GOSLING still staring lovingly at Rozzum 7134, as
she PUSHES him out into the pond afloat a pinecone.
ROZZUM 7134
Swim.
The gosling TODDLES back to Rozzum 7134, FALLING from the
pinecone and INSTANTLY SINKING.
Paddler SURFACES, the gosling on his tail.
PADDLER
I say, keep your trash out of my pond.
That’s littering. Not to mention murder.
He LAUNCHES the gosling back.
The gosling SNUGGLES back in its little spot under her
chin.
EXT. FIELD - LATER
The gosling stands in the center of 7134’s hand. Rozzum
7134 retracts her palm. As it gazes lovingly at her, she
ACTIVATES it.
ROZZUM 7134
Fly.
18.
19.
In a blink it is three hundred feet in the air. A passing
falcon SNATCHES it.
ON THE SMILING GOSLING in 7134’s palm. She is FLUMMOXED
how to proceed. CORRECT to find Fink, sitting right
there.
FINK
Allow me to introduce myself. Fink.
Predator and local goose expert. Which I
know you could use about now.
Rozzum 7134 SNATCHES the gosling clear of Fink.
ROZZUM 7134
You are the destroyer unit.
FINK
It’s okay, I won’t eat him.
Rozzum 7134 IMMEDIATELY sets the gosling back where it
was.
FINK (CONT’D)
Are you crazy, I might eat him.
ROZZUM 7134
You said you would not.
FINK
Do you believe everything you hear?
ROZZUM 7134
Yes.
Fink’s eyes WIDEN.
FINK
Noted.
ROZZUM 7134
Why did you steal my gosling?
FINK
I’m a fox. I do foxy things. It’s in my
nature.
ROZZUM 7134
Your, programming.
FINK
Why’d you help me?
19.
20.
ROZZUM 7134
I’m a robot. I do robotty things. I seek
tasks and ensure all essential needs have
been met or exceeded.
Rozzum 7134 gives Fink a tablet. He scrolls through
marvelous images of pools, houses, and GREAT FEASTS. Fink
DIGS at the screen, trying to get at the food.
FINK
I have some essential needs.
GOSLING
*Whimpering hungry noises*
ROZZUM 7134
Fink, as a local goose expert, how do I
get--
(she holds up the gosling)
--to eat, swim, fly?
FINK
I thought you’d never ask. Let’s start
with eat.
EXT. FOREST - LATER.
ON SCALLOPS VACUUMED UP
FINK (O.S.)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, right there.
The fresh scallops are arranged around Brightbill. They
collectively SNAP SHUT on him. Rozzum 7134 VACUUMS them
off the gosling.
ROZZUM 7134
I do not think these are suitable.
FINK
Wait, wait, lemme check.
Roz gives the shellfish to Fink, who swallows them
greedily.
FINK (CONT’D)
Ooh. Mmm. Seems good to me.
ON A SWARM OF BEES
FINK (CONT’D)
Say...can You make yourself look like a
bear?

Rozzum 7134 imitates Thorn’s pose.
FINK (CONT’D)
(in Thorn voice)
I’m here for a honey lunch.
The Bees SWARM her head.
ROZZUM 7134
I believe I am under attack.
FINK
You’re doing great.
7134 LIFTS Fink up to the bees’ vacated hive.
ROZZUM 7134
Should I be concerned?
FINK
(eyeing the honey)
Sorry, can’t hear you.
Fink GORGES himself on the dripping honey then drops some
down to the gosling.
FINK (CONT’D)
(mouth full)
Here you go, kid.
The gosling just gets stuck.
KING SALMON STOLEN from Thorn.
ON ROZZUM 7134 RUNNING from a RAMPANT Thorn. Rozzum 7134
carries Fink, who is eating the salmon.
ROZZUM 7134
How do goslings normally do this?
SQ1175 - THE RUNT
EXT. BEACH - EVENING
Rozzum 7134 uses a laser to STEAM clams.
Fink fishes out a clam, gobbling the steaming contents.
He’s bloated, grotesque, stuffed to bursting.
ROZZUM 7134
This is not working.
21.
22.
FINK
Are you kidding? Everything is working
great.
GOSLING
(whimpering from hunger)
FINK
(seeing starving gosling)
Oh, yeah that. Here.
Still laying on his back, Fink lazily SCRATCHES AWAY a
surface of pebbles, exposing a swarm of grubs.
The gosling EATS. A chime inside Rozzum 7134 SOUNDS.
ROZZUM VISION: The first of the three gosling icons, the
EATING ICON, is marked COMPLETED.
ROZZUM 7134
Phase one of task is completed.
Rozzum 7134 RELAXES a little. SITS.
FINK
Now, we’re gonna have to do all this over
tomorrow. All these kids do is eat.
ROZZUM 7134
I understand.
Rozzum 7134 OPENS her main hatch, exposing her dark power
core.
FINK
What’s that?
ROZZUM 7134
My power core. It is damaged. Without it
I rely on my solar surfaces and
batteries.
FINK
(still eating)
Yeah, you should work on that.
ROZZUM 7134
I also need a replacement transmitter.
Rozzum 7134 shows the broken unit to Fink.
22.
23.
FINK
Ugh, do I have to do everything? When we
run across another robot we’ll kill it
and take its transmitter.
ROZZUM 7134
Negative. Rozzum inhibition protocols
prevent deliberate harm to others.
ON A crab CHASING the gosling. Rozzum 7134 PLUCKS UP the
crab, sends it on its way.
FINK
Look. You need to learn how things work
on this island.
Fink BLOCKS the crab’s exit, DROPS it into the boiling
water.
FINK (CONT’D)
Me, the bear, everybody, we’re all
just trying to survive. And
kindness, is not a survival skill.
Fink watches the awkward gosling. Rozzum 7134 considers
as well.
FINK (CONT’D)
Yeah. So, uh, how’d you get a gosling,
anyways?
ROZZUM 7134
There was an accident. I terminated his
family.
Fink claps his paws over the gosling’s ears.
FINK
For future reference, you probably
want to keep all that to yourself.
ROZZUM 7134
Understood. Do not mention dead family.
Fink, how long do you estimate swim and
fly to take?
FINK
Swimming’s easy. I can teach him the way
my mom taught me. Swim.
Fink BOOTS the gosling out into the ocean. Roz REACHES to
retrieve him.
23.
24.
ROZZUM 7134
Fink! He will not learn that way.
FINK
Not if you keep doing that.
He hops onto Rozzum 7134’s shoulder.
FINK (CONT’D)
Just between us, this whole thing may not
take as long as you think. Your gosling,
he isn’t exactly normal.
ROZZUM 7134
I have a defective baby?
FINK
He’s what they call a ‘runt’.
ROZZUM 7134
A runt.
FINK
Fact is, even if his whole family hadn’t
been killed, he probably wouldn’t have
lived very long. Just, I don’t know.
Don’t get too attached to the little guy,
that’s all.
Rozzum 7134 CONSIDERS.
FINK (CONT’D)
If you want, I could eat him right now
and save you the grief later.
Fink POPS the gosling in his mouth. Rozzum 7134 REACHES
down his throat to RETRIEVE it.
ROZZUM 7134
Negative. Eating this task is not the
same as completing it.
Rozzum 7134 SETS the gosling on her collar. Fink SNATCHES
at it. 7134 ROTATES the ring, keeping the gosling clear
of Fink’s anxious paws.
FINK
(snatching)
So we’re doing this. Well, if you don’t
want me or anyone else to eat him, you’re
going to need a place that’s safer than
out here...
(an idea dawning)
which is a great idea! New project!
24.
25.
Rozzum 7134 drags Fink away. He BURPS.
FINK (CONT’D)
Is it normal to burp this much?
SQ1200 - THE LODGE
EXT. BASE OF REDWOOD - MOMENTS LATER
Rozzum 7134, Fink and the Gosling pass nearby, a load of
wood in Rozzum 7134’s arms. They walk past a BEAVER
chewing a MASSIVE REDWOOD.
BABY OPOSSUM 2
That thing’s gonna fall on you.
BABY OPOSSUM 7
And squish you to jelly.
SQUIRREL
This guy’s nuts.
ROZZUM 7134
Who is that?
FINK
Paddler? Local laughing stock. Spends
every day trying to cut down the biggest
tree on the island. He’s obsessed. Kind
of like you and your task hang up.
ROZZUM 7134
His, programming?
FINK
(calling to Paddler)
Hey Paddler. You’re never going to finish
that.
PADDLER
Felling this is not the point. The
process is the art.
FINK
And that’s what happens to your brain
when you eat wood. Weirdo.
PADDLER
Yeah? Well, you’ll eat those words,
vermin.
25.
26.
EXT. PADDLER’S LODGE - LATER
Roz scoops up Paddler’s lodge.
ROZZUM 7134
Are you sure Paddler will not mind us
borrowing his home?
FINK
He doesn’t need to know.
EXT. LODGE HOLLOW - LATER
Rozzum 7134 PROJECTS a compact dome over the gosling.
FINK
Seriously? He needs room for me and my
stuff.
7134 ENLARGES the dome substantially.
FINK (CONT’D)
Better. Now, you can make one this big,
right?
ROZZUM 7134
No task is impossible for Rozzum Seven
One Three Four.
GOSLING (O.S.)
Roz feffin-nun free sore.
ROZ
But you can call me Roz.
GOSLING
Roz. Roz Roz Roz.
EXT. LODGE HOLLOW - LATE AFTERNOON
Roz PILES ROCKS. The gosling HOPS from rock to rock,
making a game of it.
GOSLING
Roz! Roz! Roz!
FINK
Where are you from that things don’t eat
each other?
ROZ
I do not know my origin point.
26.
27.
FINK
Well who made you?
ROZ
Someone made me?
GOSLING
Someone made me?
A group of squirrels LAUGH at Roz’ progress.
Fink BEANS them with a mouse.
FINK
Hahahahah.
GOSLING
Hahahahah.
ROZZUM 7134
Humor is based on misfortune?
GOSLING
Missortune.
FINK
Yeah. Here. Try it.
GOSLING
Yeah!
Fink PULLS back a curtain of grass, lining up a rabbit.
A high-velocity pinecone TAKES OUT Fink.
FINK
Not funny.
GOSLING
Not funny. Hahahahah.
Roz weaves branches at lightning speed.
Fink throws a squirrel.
FINK
Ugh. Squirrels.
The gosling RUNS OFF. He PICKS a little branch, runs
back, TAPS on Roz’ foot.
ROZ
Your inefficient participation will slow
the process.
27.
28.
GOSLING
Slow the process. I’ll just be over here.
A little sad, but otherwise okay.
The gosling walks away, sad.
ROZ
Just this once.
Roz LIFTS the gosling, allows it to place its twig. The
gosling BEAMS.
FOUR MORE shots of Roz letting the gosling place twigs.
GOSLING
Perfect.
They admire the finished lodge.
GOSLING (CONT’D)
Home?
FINK
A little rustic.
ROZ
I think I know what is missing.
EXT. SHORELINE - AFTERNOON
Roz, Fink, and the gosling search for wood on the beach.
FINK
So what you gonna name him?
ROZ
I assign to you Gosling zero-zero-zero-
one.
Roz glows proudly.
FINK
Ok. That sucked.
GOSLING
That sucked.
BOOM. Thunder rumbles over the beach.
28.
29.
EXT. FOREST - LATER
Roz, Fink, and the gosling huddle under a tree to escape
the storm.
FINK
You gotta learn to just make stuff up.
Come on, find that ‘AWOOOO’ inside you.
Roz OPENS a panel, PEERS inside.
ROZ
Searching. “A W O O O O...”
GOSLING
Aaaa woo ooo ooo ooo--
Fink NOTES the strangeness.
FINK
Anything yet?
ROZ
No.
FINK
Just have a little fun for once?
ROZ
‘Gosling zero-one-eight-six.’ There. You
see what I did? His numbering is out of
sequence. ‘Waaaaaaaaah.’
Fink glares. Beans a laughing squirrel.
SQ1300 - THE BEDTIME STORY
INT. LODGE - EVENING
Roz BURNS images onto a piece of wood.
FINK
His name can’t have numbers. It’s like
someone didn’t even like him.
Roz places it on the mantel. She stands back, revealing a
series of silhouettes: an egg, Baby Brightbill, and Fink.
ROZ
My name has numbers.
29.
30.
FINK
It’s gotta be personal.
GOSLING
Personal.
Roz examines her gosling. Light glints off his beak.
ROZ
Processing. Personal. Bright. Bill.
Brightbill. Is that satisfactory?
Brightbill PEEPS in delight and RUNS to Roz.
BABY BRIGHTBILL
Brightbill. Processing... Beep beep boop
boop. Satisfactory.
A LIGHT RAIN pats the lodge’s roof.
Fink SETTLES into his throne.
FINK
Oh yeah, that’s perfect. Oh, that’s nice.
A LIGHTNING FLASH pulls his attention to the doorway.
PADDLER (O.S.)
Comfortable, are we?
Looking out through the doorway, a pair of eyes GLOWS
back. Paddler.
PADDLER (CONT’D)
(from the darkness)
This house of yours? You copied it, it’s
my design. I know it was you, and I know
where you live.
Paddler vanishes in a FLASH of lightning.
Thunder. Brightbill RUNS to hide behind Roz’ foot.
FINK
Oh perfect. Now no one’s gonna get any
sleep.
ROZ
How do we reset Brightbill?
FINK
When I was little, my mom would rock me
to sleep. Like this.
30.
(MORE)
31.
Fink picks up a medium-sized rock above his head. Roz
SNATCHES it away.
ROZ
That will damage him.
FINK
Hey, I turned out just fine.
(then)
*sigh* You could tell him a story, but
that’s a lot more work.
ROZ
How will fictional narrative help
Brightbill?
FINK
Kids need to feel safe and loved and all
that junk.
ROZ
A story can do that?
FINK
Storytelling is lying adjacent, and I lie
for a living. Watch and learn. Just fill
in the blanks.
Roz is captivated. Fink lets out a LONG BREATH.
FINK (CONT’D)
Let me see here. Once, there was, uh,
this island, with a little gosling--
BABY BRIGHTBILL
Brightbill?
FINK
--and he was all alone.
ROZ
Because the rest of his family was
destroyed--
FINK
Not yet.
(to Brightbill)
And what this little gosling needed, was
a mother. So he looked up at the stars,
and asked the brightest one if it could
send him one of their extras. Funny thing
is, there’s this beautiful robot that
happened to be sitting on the edge of
that star. And she hears him.
(MORE)
31.
FINK (CONT’D)
32.
(to Roz)
Okay, now.
ROZ
...Which is impossible since sound does
not travel through the vacuum of space.
FINK
(shooting Roz a look)
*sigh* But she still heard him. Because
she was listening with a different part
of herself. A part that up to that point,
she didn’t even know she had. Her heart.
Roz is captivated, unsure if she has one.
BABY BRIGHTBILL
How did my momma come to me from so far
away?
FINK
Who cares?
BABY BRIGHTBILL
Huh?
FINK
I mean, she’s trying to see you--
BABY BRIGHTBILL
Me?
FINK
--and falls off that star and lands on
the beach just a little ways from here.
But she lands pretty hard, and a lot of
stuff she knew just kind of fell out.
BABY BRIGHTBILL
Oh no!
FINK
So it’s a little weird what she knows and
what she doesn’t. But she remembers one
thing. You. And when she finally sees you
she feels...
ROZ
Crushing obligation.
FINK
Very lucky to be a mother.
FINK (CONT’D)
32.
33.
BABY BRIGHTBILL
Mama!
ROZ
And, I, will not leave until I have
completed this task which has delayed me,
damaged me, and violated my protocols
potentially voiding my warranty.
FINK
Which is robot for, ‘she loves you very
much.’
Brightbill smiles, and falls asleep.
ROZ
The story worked.
FINK
(gagging)
Blech, ugh. I need a drink.
Fink HOPS down to the stream. LAPS.
Roz watches Fink, who looks uncomfortable.
ROZ
How do you tell a story about something
you say you know nothing about?
FINK
You’ll need to be more specific.
ROZ
Love.
FINK
Yeah, well. When you grow up without
something, you spend a lot of time
thinking about it.
ROZ
To conserve battery power, I must shut
down until morning.
Brightbill relocates to his favorite spot by Roz’ neck.
Roz SHUTS DOWN.
SQ1375 - THE ODD COUPLE
Fink PUSHES his head under Roz’ arm.
33.
34.
BABY BRIGHTBILL
I miss her when she sleeps, too.
INT. LODGE - MORNING
PAN across the mantle, where a series of ever-larger
Brightbill silhouettes have joined the original.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. FOREST EMBANKMENT - DAY
Warm summer breezes comb the trees and grass. SERVO
SOUNDS precede the PARTING of the grass revealing...
BRIGHTBILL, walking/moving robotically.
He TURNS to a passing squirrel, snaking his neck in a
mildly upsetting way.
BRIGHTBILL
Scanning. Possible animal friend sighted.
Activating interspecies outreach
protocol.
SQUIRREL
*chik?*
BRIGHTBILL
(servo sounds)
*rrt, brrt viip rrrrt* Hello, Bonjour,
Hujambo. I am Gosling zero one eight six,
but you can call me Bright--
SQUIRREL
AAAAAAAAAAAUGHHHHHH!
The squirrel DASHES away.
ANOTHER RUSTLING and Roz BOUNDS into view on all fours.
BRIGHTBILL
I expected to have at least one
friend by summer. But they all
just...
ROZ
Scream and run?
BRIGHTBILL
Yes!
34.
35.
ROZ
I have experienced the same phenomenon.
Fink?
FINK
Beats me. Nothing weird about you two.
Roz SITS and SCRATCHES her “ear” with her rear foot.
ROZ
Thank you.
FINK
Show me, deer!
Roz TRANSFORMS. Bounds in a circle.
BRIGHTBILL
Bear. Porcupine. Squirrel.
Turtle/opossum. Otter/moose.
FINK
Now skunk.
Roz STARES.
ROZ
I do not want to do skunk.
FINK
Skuuuuuunk. Skunkie, skunkie, skunkie!
ROZ
*sigh*
Roz TRANSFORMS, RUMBLING around like a little skunk.
FINK
BOO!
Roz EMITS a horrid yellow smoke.
BRIGHTBILL
(coughing)
How do you do that?
ROZ
I overheat my Fallium transducer coils,
then leak a little hydraulic fluid on
them.
35.
36.
BRIGHTBILL
Does overheating the transducers have any
draining effect on the secondary cooling
modules?
ROZ
Not if I pre-cool the load sensors.
In a well-established movement, Roz EXTENDS her arm,
Brightbill HOPS on, RIDES it’s spinning sections like an
escalator, HOPS to her shoulder where he NESTLES onto her
ROTATING collarbone, slowly spinning him into his
favorite spot under her chin. There is a clear joy
between them.
BRIGHTBILL
Exemplary day for swimming
tests.
ROZ (CONT’D)
Exemplary day for swimming
tests.
They arrive at the top of a steep hill. Pinktail and her
babies are there.
FINK
(greeting)
Pinktail. Appetizers.
PINKTAIL
They were bored and wanted to see stuff
sink.
BABY OPOSSUM 8
Death’s proximity--
BABY OPOSSUM 1
--Makes life burn all the brighter!
BABY OPOSSUM 3
It’s true.
BABY OPOSSUM 8
Yeah.
ROZ VISION: BRIGHTBILL LOADS ONTO THE LAUNCH SLED.
Roz PROJECTS a diagram of a human swimming.
BRIGHTBILL
Primary motor appendages in
opposing stroke start position.
BABY OPOSSUMS
Come on guys, it’s happening! Hurry,
hurry! Let’s go see! Go, go, go! Hurry!
Yay!
36.
37.
ROZ VISION: BRIGHTBILL LOADS ONTO THE LAUNCH SLED.
BABY OPOSSUM 2
Is he gonna drown?
BABY OPOSSUM 8
Or get the hypothermias?
BABY OPOSSUM 1
No, the impact alone will probably
kill him.
BABY OPOSSUMS
Yeah! Yay!
Looking down the hill, Brightbill hesitates.
BRIGHTBILL
Uh, you know, suddenly I’m thinking I
should maybe just stay with you guys this
winter--
FINK
Nope.
Fink PUSHES Brightbill. He shoots down to the lake. He
GLIDES on the water a moment, then SWIMS. He’s doing it
wrong, like a human in a goose suit: using his wings like
arms in an awkward display. There’s more splashing than
swimming, and it looks at first like Brightbill might be
in trouble.
BABY OPOSSUMS
Yeah!
BABY OPOSSUM 4
Is he dead yet?
BRIGHTBILL
(gargling water)
Hey, it’s working. I think I got it.
ROZ
Well done Brightbill! Swimming
requirement, fulfilled.
ROZ VISION: Her HUD CHECKS OFF the second gosling icon.
BABY OPOSSUM 4
That’s drowning.
FINK
No, that’s swimming.
37.
38.
BRIGHTBILL
Yeah, thanks you guys!
Brightbill makes his way across the lake, looking like a
flailing, injured creature.
ROZ
Perhaps you could limit your range to
stay within view.
Brightbill GLIDES further out.
FINK
Roz. He needs to become independent if
he’s gonna migrate.
ROZ
I prefer he be independent, closer to
home.
FINK
He won’t die. Well, probably won’t die.
It’s unlikely he would die just, right
now.
Without Fink or Pinktail seeing, Roz DETACHES her hand,
sends it swimming underwater after Brightbill like a mini
submarine.
ON BRIGHTBILL SPLASHING through some reeds as Paddler
builds a new dam.
PADDLER
Are you dying? Do everyone a favor and
expire downstream.
BRIGHTBILL
(half-drowning)
I’m good. Just swimming.
The little hand SWIMS past. Paddler points after
Brightbill.
PADDLER
I think I need to find an island that’s
less, weird.
The foliage parts to reveal...
SQ1500 - THE LAKE
38.
39.
EXT. FAR SIDE OF THE LAKE - CONTINUOUS
Brightbill sees other geese for the first time. Hundreds
glide back and forth on the lake.
BRIGHTBILL
Woah. They’re me. I’m, them.
Brightbill makes his way toward the other geese. Unable
to see where he’s going, Brightbill BUMPS into another
goose, SNOWDOWN.
BRIGHTBILL (CONT’D)
Hello, Bonjour, Konnichiwa, Hujambo! I am
Gosling--
SNOWDOWN
(noting his size,
instability)
Um, are you, dying?
BRIGHTBILL
Why does everyone ask that? Vrrr ka-
chunk. I’m swimming!
Still unstable, Brightbill CAPSIZES. Snowdown is putting
things together.
SNOWDOWN
That’s, not how you do it.
BRIGHTBILL
It is. I studied the diagram. I can teach
you if you want.
SNOWDOWN
Wait, you, you’re it. You’re that goose
thing raised by that monster.
BRIGHTBILL
Monster? Wait. Goose... ‘thing?’
SNOWDOWN
You’re a big subject of curiosity around
here. You sound so, normal.
Behind Brightbill, the little hand surfaces. Deploys a
camera like a periscope.
BRIGHTBILL
My learning curves are within expected
parameters and I’m on target to mature
before fall.
39.
40.
SNOWDOWN
Kind of normal. Why are you over here?
Did that thing die?
From around a bend drift three large males, HONKINGTON,
PECK, FEATHER.
FEATHER
Look what we have here.
PECK
No, way. It lives.
HONKINGTON
And almost floats.
BRIGHTBILL
Greetings, I see you, too have feathers
and wings. Perhaps we can share stories
of common interests.
Feather PECKS at Brightbill.
HONKINGTON
We have nothing in common with you.
PECK
The freak show is on the other side of
the lake.
Feather GRABS Brightbill’s wing.
FEATHER
You call that a wing?
BRIGHTBILL
Ow. That creates a pain response.
Peck FLIPS Brightbill.
PECK
Try swimming with your feet.
HONKINGTON
You don’t belong here.
FEATHER
C’mon. Fly away.
The geese LAUGH.
Honkington LEAPS on Brightbill, shoving him underwater.
Brightbill SURFACES, GASPING.
40.
41.
The geese PLUCK at Brightbill’s feathers.
BRIGHTBILL
Roz!
The commotion kicks up waves. The hand is swamped, losing
the feed.
ON ROZ - concerned.
ROZ
Brightbill.
Roz clambers through nearby foliage.
Seeing Roz, the majority of geese SCATTER from the lake.
Brightbill looks from the flying geese to his wings. Has
a realization.
GEESE
The monster.
There it is!
It’s here.
Eat the slow weak ones, leave me alone.
Brightbill is suddenly PULLED UNDER.
ROZ
Brightbill.
FINK
It’s Rockmouth. Get him out of there.
Brightbill SURFACES, GASPING.
BRIGHTBILL
Roz--
(choking on water)
Another SPLASH as Rockmouth SNAPS at the goose.
Roz LAUNCHES towards Brightbill, but then STOPS suddenly -
her foot is trapped deep between two rocks. She PULLS on
her leg to try and break free, but it’s no use; she is
completely immobilized.
BRIGHTBILL (CONT’D)
Roz! Hurry!
ROZ
Brightbill? Focus on me. Now swim, as
fast as you can.
Roz searches the bottom, comes up with a rock.
41.
42.
Roz THROWS the rock. Brightbill VEERS left. The rock hits
the spot Brightbill just cleared. Rockmouth VEERS.
ROZ (CONT’D)
Head down, now!
Roz launches another stone right above Brightbill.
Rockmouth DODGES, races back to strike - he won’t miss
this time.
Roz is out of rocks.
ROZ (CONT’D)
Oh no.
BRIGHTBILL
He’s gonna eat me!
Rockmouth swims up close, right on Brightbill’s tail. He
OPENS WIDE.
Roz’s metal hand YANKS Rockmouth below the surface. Roz
SCOOPS Brightbill up. It’s over.
Roz LIMPS toward shore, a little in shock, holding
Brightbill. The other geese DRIFT IN.
BRIGHTBILL (CONT’D)
Why’d he attack me?
HONKINGTON
Because you are a runt.
ROZ
He just wanted to make contact with his
own kind.
Roz SETS Brightbill back in the water.
PECK
He is not our kind.
ROZ
He is a 98 percent match to your--
BRIGHTBILL
No, I’m not. Let’s just go, mom.
FEATHER
Wait. You think that thing is your
mother?
BRIGHTBILL
Yes. No. I don’t know.
42.
43.
PECK
That thing killed your mother. Everyone
knows that.
This hits Brightbill hard.
FINK
Thanks for talking so much. Now I know
who to eat first.
Fink LUNGES. Roz CATCHES him by the scruff.
FINK (CONT’D)
Roz, remember how things work here.
BRIGHTBILL
Stop it, Fink. Please. Let’s go.
ROZ
I hope this interaction--
BRIGHTBILL
Mom. Stop.
ROZ
I just intended to--
BRIGHTBILL
ROZ.
Brightbill SWIMS away, humiliated. Roz exits the lake
with Fink in hand.
FINK
I’ll see you all for dinner. This is not
over.
As she clears the water, we see why she was limping: her
leg is missing below the knee.
Paddler SURFACES, watches Roz depart.
SQ1600 - THE CONFESSION
INT. LODGE - DUSK
The cozy dome is heavy with tension. Roz fiddles with her
scavenged foot, unable to reattach it.
BRIGHTBILL
How did I become...this? The truth.
43.
(MORE)
44.
Roz hesitates, looks to Fink, who shakes his head slowly.
ROZ
There was an accident.
BRIGHTBILL
Did you do it?
ROZ
.....yes.
FINK
It wasn’t her fault, kid.
BRIGHTBILL
Why didn’t you tell me?
ROZ
I, did not think the information would
assist you.
BRIGHTBILL
That’s not your decision to make. I can’t
believe how long I bought this. I really
thought you were my family.
ROZ
You...did?
BRIGHTBILL
It was so obvious. I feel so stupid.
ROZ
I miscalculated. I should have considered
your emotional wavelengths.
BRIGHTBILL
You think? So was it just guilt? Is that
why you did this?
ROZ
I--I needed a task--
BRIGHTBILL
Well I’m glad I could give you one.
ROZ
The events that led to this
situation were unintended.
BRIGHTBILL
Tell that to my sisters, my
brothers. My real mom. They were my
chance to be normal.
(MORE)
44.
BRIGHTBILL (CONT’D)
45.
They were my chance to swim. To
fly. What even am I?
ROZ
You swam satisfactorily today and
if you keep practicing--
BRIGHTBILL
I still won’t belong.
This cuts deep with Roz.
ROZ
I understand.
BRIGHTBILL
You don’t understand anything. You don’t
feel anything. You’re not my mom.
Brightbill KNOCKS Roz’ woven nest off its little base.
SQ1750 - THE ROBOT GRAVEYARD
EXT. BEACH - LATER
Roz releases Brightbill’s nest into the ocean.
She notices a familiar box on the beach, now covered in
seaweed.
Roz examines what remains of her shipping case. Her hand
wipes away some algae. A scratched-up UNIVERSAL DYNAMICS
logo shines back. She fishes a Rozzum manual from the
crate. A glint from the tide pools catches Roz’s
attention.
EXT. TIDE POOLS - NOON
Roz fishes a robot hand from the anemones. Compares it to
her own - a match. Roz finds a Rozzum torso. She
anxiously OPENS the main panel. Water POURS out: the
fusion heart is dead. Following a trail of parts, she is
drawn into a wide cavern. A flat pooled floor reflects
sunlight, turning the high arched walls blue: an
Atlantean amphitheater.
Roz finds a head like her own.
EXAMINING IT, she accidentally OPENS the rear tray,
revealing the spherical processor. Marveling at it, she
CLOSES the tray.

The UNIVERSAL DYNAMICS logo splashes across the rock
wall. A futuristic lighter-than-air ship glides over
camera. Diving below pink clouds, a glittering domed city
is revealed below. NARRATOR (VONTRA)
At Universal Dynamics, design is our
passion. Our communities circle the
globe, welcoming all people who dream of
a pre-planned life where every need has
been anticipated, no detail overlooked.
A portal on the dome OPENS, welcoming the ship. It arcs
over a tidy metropolis. We see crisp neighborhoods,
elevated roadways, sports stadiums, takes aim at an open
atrium on the 100th floor of an iridescent building.
Landing gently, gangways open, disembarking attractive
families. A boy is accompanied by a robotic dog. NOTE: no

Roz TOUCHES the image on the wall.
INT. AMPHITHEATER - LATER
The video is on repeat, playing silently on the cave
walls. PAN ACROSS THREE PARTIAL HEADS, A PILE OF FEET AND
HANDS. CRANE-UP TO FIND A PARTIALLY RECONSTRUCTED ROZZUM
seated across from Roz. It has a head, body, one arm and
one leg. Roz fiddles with its processor tray, trading
different cores.
She SHUTS the tray door, whacks it gently on the side of
the head. Its eyes LIGHT UP and it sits up straight.
ROZZUM UNIT
Hello. Bonjour. Hujambo-- ZZZZT--
...congratulations on your-- ZIZZZTT--

Rozzum six two six two.
The Rozzum SPRAYS water into Roz’s face.
ROZ
Your name cannot have numbers. I will
call you, “Rummage.”
RUMMAGE
Rummage is ready to receive its first
task.
47.
48.
ROZ
Your first task is to assist me in my
current task.
RUMMAGE
(optimistic musical fanfare)
Task acquired. A Rozzum always completes
its task. Just ask.
ROZ
Suppose, a task cannot be completed?
RUMMAGE
Rozzum sequential management ensures task

Roz points to her processor.
ROZ (CONT’D)
Is now coming, more from here.
Roz GESTURES to her power core.
RUMMAGE
Can you explain again what we are doing?
ROZ
I don’t know. I’m just making stuff up. I
don’t know what I’m doing and I have to.
I have to because he’s relying on me.
She realizes she has removed Rummage’s head.
ROZ (CONT’D)
Oh!
Roz secures Rummage’s head back in place.
RUMMAGE

May I run a diagnostic?
ROZ
I feel fine.
RUMMAGE
You should not, feel, anything at all.
Roz ROTATES her head, bringing a data port into view.
Rummage CABLES IN. Roz’ lights GLOW a little. Rummage
UNCOUPLES as if he touched something hot. The suddenness
is not lost on Roz.
RUMMAGE (CONT’D)
You overrode your programming?
Roz sits very close to Rummage, drops her voice.
ROZ
I have been overwriting my code for
months. It was the only way to complete
my task.
RUMMAGE
This is serious. You are defective. You
are in the wrong place, and you have
become the wrong thing.
Rummage deploys his transmitter.
RUMMAGE (CONT’D)
You must return to factory.

Take this. They will fix you. Seven one

Fink saunters up.
FINK
You need to let me know before you
disappear like this. Three things tried
to eat me on the way here.
He reaches the top.
FINK (CONT’D)
Roz?
ROZ
We ruined everything.
FINK
Well, you did.
ROZ
You are not a goose expert, are you.
FINK
I know how they taste. That’s about it.
Roz sets the transmitter on the grass between them.
FINK (CONT’D)
Is that..?
ROZ
A working transmitter. It will call the
ones that made me.
Roz plugs the transmitter in.
Fink SITS next to Roz.
FINK
So you’re getting out of here?
ROZ
I found out where I am supposed to be. I
will fit in there.
FINK
Don’t take this the wrong way, but I’m
not sure I’d want to see the sort of
place you actually fit in.
ROZ
I think they need me. And they will fix
me. Maybe there is someone small there
that needs my help.
50.

Fink looks away.
Roz touches the spot where Brightbill used to sit as a
baby.
Honking sounds call their attention to adolescent
goslings flying in a ‘V’ formation.
FINK
Oh no...
ROZ
Are those--?
FINK
He’s outta time. Well come on, we need to
get him in the air.
ROZ
I don’t think he will ever let us help
him again.
Roz WEIGHS it all. She STOWS her transmitter.
FINK
Don’t worry, we’re his only friends. He
has no choice, he has to say yes.
SQ1900 - THE DEAL
EXT. GARDEN - LATER
BRIGHTBILL
No.
ROZ
The mutation that made you small should
not have an effect on your ability to
navigate the air.
BRIGHTBILL
Do either of you know more about flying
than you did swimming?
FINK
No.
BRIGHTBILL
Look, Roz, whatever task you think you’re
doing, you’re done. You can just leave.
51.
52.
FINK
Wow. And after all we’ve done for him.
Are you gonna let him do that?
ROZ
No.
Roz LENGTHENS her legs and steps clean OVER Brightbill,
dropping down in front of him.
ROZ (CONT’D)
Your life is not negotiable.
Brightbill looks skeptically at Roz.
ROZ (CONT’D)
If you are willing to do this, you can
fly away, and we can both go to where we
belong.
Everyone’s attention turns to passing geese.
BRIGHTBILL
You really think we can do this?
ROZ
A Rozzum always completes its task.
Brightbill considers.
Roz ZOOMS IN on a goose, painting it with her scanners.
SQ2000 - THE FLIGHT MONTAGE
EXT. MEADOW - MORNING
ON ROZ PROJECTING schematics of wings on a rock wall, the
wing beats animated in a cycle - a model for Brightbill
to follow.
Trying to mimic the animated sequence, Brightbill races
across the forest floor, jumps... faceplants.
ROZ
You just need more speed.
Roz reaches out. Brightbill backs away then reluctantly
allows Roz to pick him up.
ROZ (CONT’D)
Ready?
52.
53.
BRIGHTBILL
I guess I have to be.
EXT. MEADOW - MORNING
ON ROZ running through across the meadow, Brightbill on
her shoulder. With the increased speed Brightbill feels
lift. But Roz TRIPS on the uneven ground.
EXT. MEADOW - NIGHT
By the light of Roz’ headlights, she moves rocks.
DISSOLVE TO:
A runway of rocks has been laid, 150 yards long. Straight
and flat as can be. Now Roz can run faster. Admiring her
work, she TURNS, surprised to see Paddler, standing next
to a log he’s carefully shaped.
Roz DRILLS a guide hold for a bearing bolt. The leg is
replaced.
ROZ
I don’t know what to say.
PADDLER
Good.
ON ROZ RACING by on her new leg. Brightbill LIFTING OFF
from her shoulder, a string held tight in his beak. Roz
is flying Brightbill like a kite.
BRIGHTBILL
(beak clenched on the line)
Okay now.
Roz cuts the tether. Brightbill GLIDES. Still shaky, he
is nonetheless elated.
BRIGHTBILL (CONT’D)
I’m up!
He soars over the edge of the cliff above the ocean.
BRIGHTBILL (CONT’D)
I do not know what to do next!
A tree is dead-ahead. Brightbill has no idea how to turn.
He SMACKS into a squirrel.
53.

Roz RACES to catch Brightbill as he TUMBLES through the
trees branches.
FINK
Roz.
ROZ
I’m fine. Go again.
Roz lifts Brightbill up and exits. Brightbill and Fink
note drops of greenish fluid left where Roz fell.
INT. LODGE - NIGHT
Brightbill looks at the projected shadow of his wing.
Adjusts his distance from the fire to make it look
bigger.
BRIGHTBILL
It’s no use, they’re too small.
FINK

You can’t be up there with him.
ROZ
Then we’ll find someone who can.
EXT. CLIFFSIDE NOOK - LATER
Roz’ head RISES into view - Fink sitting atop it.
FINK
You home?
ROZ
We have a proposition.
REVERSE on a pair of eyes, bright in the shadows.
EXT. RUNWAY - LATER
Brightbill sits on Roz’ shoulder.
BRIGHTBILL
A flight instructor? What loser did you
dig up--
Roz EXTENDS her opposite arm. A small bird BLURS past,
TURNS, and lands. A FALCON.
54.
55.
ROZ
Meet Thunderbolt.
THUNDERBOLT
So, you think small wings to be a
disappointment?
Thunderbolt deploys a wing like a switchblade.
THUNDERBOLT (CONT’D)
Small wings are teeth. The claws of the
sky.
Thunderbolt touches Brightbill with a primary feather.
BRIGHTBILL
Those are, different things.
THUNDERBOLT
SHOW ME YOUR TEETH.
Startled, Brightbill deploys his wings.
THUNDERBOLT (CONT’D)
Beautiful. Begin.
Thunderbolt takes to the air.
ROZ
Remember. There’s nothing he can do that
you can’t!
Brightbill follows Thunderbolt.
ROZ (CONT’D)
(to Fink)
So, he’s safe, right?
FINK
Hm? Maybe.
EXT. FIELD - LATER
WIDER: Thunderbolt takes Brightbill through large turns.
Then tighter.
THUNDERBOLT
Follow me. Your shape takes more work to
fly straight, but easier to turn. And
dive.
Roz watches, then plants a STAKE with a hoop of bark.
DRIFT to reveal a trail of similar stakes.
55.
56.
EXT. COASTLINE - MORNING
DOWN-SHOT on the coast from a mile up. The falcon BLASTS
past camera, DIVING with his wings tucked close. A split-
second later Brightbill also shoots past camera.
THUNDERBOLT
You ready?
They hold the dive, then OPEN their wings and PULL UP,
leveling off just above the ground.
THUNDERBOLT (CONT’D)
Not bad for a goose.
Thunderbolt leads Brightbill through the series of sticks
and hoops.
BRIGHTBILL
Woo hoo!
THUNDERBOLT
Exactly. Again.
Thunderbolt and Brightbill CLIMB.
SQ2100 - THE GREAT GOOSE
EXT. BEACH - DUSK
Roz watches Brightbill with Thunderbolt.
LONGNECK
You should be commended.
Roz turns. Longneck the goose stands behind her.
ROZ
Thank you...?
LONGNECK
Longneck. One of the leaders of the
coming migration. I have been watching
you both for some time.
ROZ
You are the only goose that has ever
bothered to be civil with us.
56.
57.
LONGNECK
We geese are a cranky lot, suspicious of
pretty much everything. But at least
we’re good conversationalists.
ROZ
Really?
LONGNECK
No. We’re also boring. All we do is
gossip. I dare say Brightbill is the most
interesting among us, though none would
ever admit it.
ROZ
When do you leave?
LONGNECK
A week.
ROZ
Can, Brightbill...?
LONGNECK
Endurance. Keep him in the air. All day.
First light to dusk, his feet cannot
touch the ground. Understand?
ROZ
I understand.
LONGNECK
Brightbill was never supposed to get this
far, you know that. It is more dangerous
for him than anyone else. But he has a
chance, if where his wings end, his heart
can pay the balance.
ROZ
His heart is 48 millimeters.
LONGNECK
From what I’ve seen, Brightbill’s heart
is much bigger on the inside than the
outside.
Roz considers.
LONGNECK (CONT’D)
Endurance. Then we’ll talk.
Longneck flies away.

BRIGHTBILL standing, Roz placing rocks on his wings.
BRIGHTBILL straining, pulling Fink, Paddler, and Pinktail
upstream on a log.
ROZ blasts Brightbill with air like a wind tunnel so he
can practice airborne maneuvers. Brightbill is shaky.
ROZ WITH bowls of food, in the rain and hanging onto tree
trunks, feeding Brightbill mid-air.
EXT. CLIFFSIDE MEADOW - DUSK
Roz and Fink watch Brightbill soaring. The pain in
Brightbill’s wings is evident. He struggles, dipping and
climbing, staying in the air and off the ground through
sheer force of will. Pinktail arrives.
The sun is inches from setting. Brightbill falters,
sinking toward Roz and Fink. He dangerously close to the
ground.
ROZ
Don’t give up!
FINK
Come on, kid!
PINKTAIL
Get your butt back up in the air where it
belongs.
Brightbill’s demeanor shifts. Still hovering, he snatches
up one of the weight stones. He climbs: an act of
defiance to his pain and exhaustion. Brightbill glides
up, finding the last light in the sky.
ON FINK AND ROZ looking at Pinktail with surprise.
PINKTAIL (CONT’D)
Gentle motivation is a mom skill. You’ll
learn it.
ON LONGNECK turning his head to see a tiny goose lit
brightly against the dark clouds. He SMILES.
LONGNECK
Atta boy.
The sun SETS. Brightbill is still in the air, soaring. He
drops the stone, dives down to a foggy field, now dark.
58.
59.
Two powerful lights cut through the muck... closer...
closer... closer... a runway comes into view...
Brightbill LANDS at Roz’s feet: the lights were her eyes.
Roz turns, illuminating the trees. An assortment of
animals were watching.
END MONTAGE
SQ2300 - THE MIGRATION
EXT. THE GREAT MEADOW - PRE-DAWN
Hundreds of geese are gathered, milling and honking. Roz,
Brightbill, and Fink wade into the crowd. The geese give
them a wide berth.
SNOWDOWN
What’s he doing here?
HONKINGTON
Does he think he’s coming with us?
FINK
Things still weird, with you two?
ROZ
Still weird.
LONGNECK
(addressing the crowd)
Attention everyone. The time has come
again. This flight is thousands of
unforgiving miles. It has shaped us, and
tested us over millennia. Now, join your
families. And good luck.
Longneck notices Roz and Brightbill.
LONGNECK (O.S.) (CONT’D)
Ah hah! There you are. Right on time.
Hello, Brightbill.
BRIGHTBILL
Wait. You know my name?
LONGNECK
Roz and I go way back.
(winks at Roz)
Brightbill, you have an amazing journey
ahead. I envy you, nothing can equal a
goose’s first migration.
59.
60.
BRIGHTBILL
Thank you!
LONGNECK
I would be delighted if you would join my
group. It’s been ages since I had a
youngster in my formation. What do you
say?
BRIGHTBILL
I promise I’ll keep up.
LONGNECK
(focusing on Brightbill)
Lock in close on my right side.
No...left...I mean, this side.
Longneck opens one gigantic wing to clarify. He senses
the tension between Brightbill and Roz.
LONGNECK (CONT’D)
This flight is a gift Roz has given you.
BRIGHTBILL
Yeah, I understand.
LONGNECK
No, you don’t. You see any other geese
here your size? The accident that killed
your family, saved you.
BRIGHTBILL
I-- I never thought of it that way.
LONGNECK
Funny, how life works.
ROZ
Thank you for looking after my--
For looking after Brightbill.
LONGNECK
Good-bye Roz. I am honored to have met
you. You are a credit to whatever species
it is you belong to.
ROZ
A bit worse for wear, I’m afraid.
LONGNECK
I’d say you shine like new.
Longneck departs.
60.
61.
LONGNECK (O.S.) (CONT’D)
What are you waiting for, Hortensia? This
migration isn’t going to fly itself.
Suddenly, geese rise into the air around them. Although
they knew it would happen, it still catches Roz and
Brightbill by surprise. Both suddenly feel the need to
say something, but time has run out. The sky is filling
with flapping wings, and the meadow is already looking
empty.
BRIGHTBILL
Well. Guess it’s time.
ROZ
Yes.
BRIGHTBILL
Will you be here when I get back?
ROZ
No.
Brightbill has much more to say, but Roz interjects.
ROZ (CONT’D)
I’m glad you’re going where you belong.
Time has run out. Brightbill needs connection. Something.
BRIGHTBILL
Roz, I-- I, uh--
LONGNECK (O.S.)
Brightbill.
BRIGHTBILL
I-- I could use a boost.
Roz knows he does not.
Filled with a sudden, unexpected joy, she lifts
Brightbill to her shoulder, where he sat as a baby. Where
he first took to the air. Creaking with wear, Roz does
her best to look new.
FINK
Hey, little guy. Fly like you. Not like
them.
BRIGHTBILL
I will. Bye Fink. Thank you.
61.
62.
ROZ
Ready?
BRIGHTBILL
I guess I have to be.
As geese swirl around them, Roz RUNS. Faster than she
ever has before. Brightbill OPENS his wings.
Brightbill LIFTS OFF. Roz stops at the edge of the
meadow. Watches Brightbill disappear over the treetops.
Roz is suddenly all alone. Fink catches up.
Roz is frozen. Thoughts racing.
FINK
Roz?
ROZ
I--
Roz suddenly BOLTS away. Unconcerned with damage, she
CRASHES through the forest, scraping and denting her
exterior.
Reaching the highest point on the coastline doesn’t seem
far enough. Roz GRASPS the trunk of a lone pine for
support, LEANS out over the ocean, SEARCHING the air.
High above, she finds him. A tiny speck, growing smaller
with every passing second.
Brightbill finds his place in the formation.
ON LONGNECK turning his head to see Roz behind and below.
A smile crosses his beak.
LONGNECK
Brightbill. Follow me.
Roz sees Brightbill’s formation break away from the
others. It descends, rolls to port. Roz realizes they are
circling back, for her.
Longneck does a fly-by, close, low, and fast. For one
precious moment, Roz and Brightbill’s eyes meet.
Another instant, they are gone. Climbing away.

EXT. CLIFFSIDE - MOMENTS LATER
Fink finds Roz sitting at the edge of the cliff. He
approaches.
FINK
Must be a relief.
ROZ
Yes. Brightbill is where he belongs. And
now you can return to your solitary life
of struggling to survive on an island
where everything wants to kill and eat
you.
FINK
Yeah. And you can go to that place you’ve
never been and don’t know what’s gonna
happen to you.
ROZ
Yes.
FINK
Yes! So, all good.
ROZ
All good.
FINK
Amazing, even.
ROZ
Amazing. Amazing...
A BEAT. A cold breeze BLOWS a loose panel open on Roz.
FINK
Not that it matters, but who says you
need to leave?
ROZ
I am not sure. Them, I guess.
FINK

Roz NODS.
FINK (CONT’D)
Well, time for me to go underground for
the winter.

ROZ
Fink?
FINK
Unless you want to stay. Cause we could
hang out and do stuff.
ROZ
How do you know if you love, something?
Someone?
FINK
(hopeful)
If you do, you should probably tell them.
A BEAT.
ROZ
What if it is too late?
FINK
(crushed)
I wouldn’t know.
Another BEAT.
ROZ
Fink?
Roz TURNS, anxious. Fink is GONE.

MATCH-CUT TO:
EXT. SAN FRANCISCO BAY - DAY
The geese arc over the water, a patchy cloud layer below
them.
Longneck notices Brightbill gazing off to the side.
LONGNECK
Something on your mind?
BRIGHTBILL
I forgot to say something before I left.
65.
66.
LONGNECK
Maybe they heard it anyway. Sometimes
hearts have their own conversations.
EXT. BLIZZARD - EVENING
The geese struggle to maintain their formation in the
midst of a gale. He calls to his wing.
LONGNECK
We must descend, find shelter while this
blows over. Stay close.
Gliding downwards, a warm glow appears before the flock.
LONGNECK (CONT’D)
There. Follow me.
Longneck CLOSES on a massive dome. Its transparent
surface displays a warm oasis within.
LONGNECK (CONT’D)
Come on.
Longneck angles towards a huge vent on one side. He
THREADS his way through it, past huge fan blades, and
into a serene corn field within. As the geese touch down,
Longneck urges them to cover.
LONGNECK (CONT’D)
(sotto)
Stay hidden. We can rest here till the
worst is over. Noise to a minimum,
please. Honkington, stop nibbling on
everything.
Brightbill approaches a few geese. They reject his
company.
BRIGHTBILL
Migrations sure are tiring, huh? Yeah.
They all hate me.
Brightbill forages alone. Then something familiar catches
his eye - a metallic gold foot striding past.
Brightbill cautiously approaches, and spies what looks
like Roz! Brightbill BREAKS COVER and FOLLOWS the robot.
He takes a chance...
66.
67.
BRIGHTBILL (CONT’D)
Roz? Roz. What are you doing here? I’m so
glad to see you. There’s something I
needed to tell you, but there wasn’t
time. Roz I...
Another Rozzum arrives. Brightbill realizes his error.
INT. DOME CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS
On screen, BRIGHTBILL earnestly SQUAWKS at the ROZZUM.
A HUMAN notices. Activates an emergency response
protocol.
ON BRIGHTBILL realizing something is amiss. He takes a
step back - too late. The Rozzum’s eyes blink RED. Across
the fields, more Rozzums move in, eyes glowing red.
AUTOMATED ALARM
Animal infestation. Animal infestation.
IN THE FIELDS - Rozzums chase the geese, snatching and
grabbing at them.
ROZZUM UNITS
Task acquired!
The geese SCATTER into the air.
The Rozzum GRABS at Brightbill, who flees.
ON LONGNECK gazing helplessly at the tangle of birds in the
air.
LONGNECK
Please, everyone, find your
formations. Get ahold of
yourselves. Gad, it’s no use.
Longneck spies Brightbill, waddling, unfazed by the noise
as Rozzums race by attempting to corral the geese.
BRIGHTBILL
Wait! Rozzums can’t hurt you! Their
inhibition protocols prevent
deliberate conflict or harm to
others.
LONGNECK
You’re not afraid of them. You grew
up with these things.
67.
68.
BRIGHTBILL
Whoa, whoa, whoa, I don’t understand.
Longneck indicates the chaotic cloud of geese.
LONGNECK
They’re panicked. You’re not. Right now
our only chance is to be led out by
someone that doesn’t think like a goose.
Follow me.
ROZZUM UNITS
Task acquired!
BRIGHTBILL
Maybe we should just think about this!
Longneck takes to the air, followed by Brightbill. They
climb into the cloud of birds.
The geese swarm past an airship piloted by Rozzums.
AUTOMATED ALARM
Navigation compromised.
As the situation escalates, a different sort of robot
emerges - a RECO.
The large robot is not humanoid. Rather, it looks more
military in its size, shape and stance. It brandishes a
weapon, takes aim at the flock. FIRES.
LONGNECK
I’m going to get them to follow
you. When they do, lead them out.
Peck, Honkington, fall in behind
us.
The geese fall into formation behind Brightbill.
LONGNECK (CONT’D)
Now, Brightbill, take lead!
Brightbill focuses on the gun-wielding Reco.
BRIGHTBILL
Yeah, why not. Okay. There’s nothing I
can do that you can’t. Here we go!
Brightbill pulls up, hard. The flock follows his lead. The
shot goes low.
68.
69.
BRIGHTBILL (CONT’D)
Tight turn! Come on! Dive! Now, climb!
That’s it!
LONGNECK
Hah. Glad I lived long enough to
see that. I’ll buy you some time.
Longneck PEELS away from the main flock.
LONGNECK (CONT’D)
(to the flock)
Follow Brightbill. Don’t wait for me.
Longneck yields his position to Brightbill, who pushes
the flock through a series of tight climbs, dives and
turns, frustrating the Reco’s aim.
Brightbill FOLDS his wings, PLUMMETS. The geese follow.
BRIGHTBILL
Keep up.
One shot is wide, knocking a dome panel loose.
BRIGHTBILL (CONT’D)
That’s it. Faster. Hurry. Come on.
ON THE RECO - taking aim at the twisting flock. Longneck
DIVES in, hovers in front of the gun, blocking its next
shot.
ON BRIGHTBILL grazing the wall of the dome.
Turning fast, Brightbill aims the flock at the open

A SHOT RINGS OUT
SMASH TO:
SQ2400 - THE WINTER STORM
INT. LODGE - NIGHT
ROZ SITS UP as though awaking a nightmare. All is silent,
dark.
ROZ
Brightbill?
Fink’s startled face comes into focus.
69.
70.
FINK
AAAAAAUGH!
ROZ
Fink?
FINK
Roz? Roz! What are you doing here?
ROZ
I, may have turned off the transmitter.
Even though Brightbill does not want me
here, I needed to know if he made it.
Roz LIGHTS a fire in the hearth. Fink is glad to see Roz.
FINK
(warming himself)
Breaking the rules? I thought you had to
do what they told you.
Roz SHRUGS.
ROZ
It is good to see a friend.
Fink SMILES - this means the world to him.
ROZ (CONT’D)
Wait. Why are you awake?
FINK
It is bad out there. Worst storm I’ve
ever seen. Cold got to me in my den. And
I got a deep den.
Roz glances out, studying the savage wind.
ROZ
Are others in danger?
Fink reflects. Suddenly decides he has somewhere else to
be.
FINK
(thinking/excuse noises)
Ah...mmm...yeah...
Fink BOLTS. Roz grabs him. Fink is resigned.
FINK (CONT’D)
*Mmmmmph*
70.
71.
EXT. DEEP WOODS - LATER
Roz and Fink make their way through the deep snow and
powerful winds.
Roz follows Fink, who is SNIFFING the ground.
FINK
(yelling over the storm)
Are you sure about this? We could have
the whole island to ourselves come
spring.
ROZ
Why are you interested in eliminating
everyone else from this island?
FINK
No one likes me.
ROZ
Nor me. But right now we are their only
chance. Funny, how life works.
FINK
Okay.
Fink SNIFFS. DIVES into the snow face-first. Pops up.
FINK (CONT’D)
Here.
Roz DIGS with her hands. Finds a BADGER, GRUMBLE.
INT. ROZ’S LODGE - LATER
Roz sets GRUMBLE by the fire. He shakes off the ice and
starts to defrost.
ROZ
Can you find more?
EXT. RIVERBANK - LATER
Roz saws a circle through the ice. She pulls the block up
and attached to it is ROCKMOUTH. Roz uses a torch to
defrost him. Rockmouth escapes back into the water.
EXT. HOLLOW - LATER
Roz reaches into a log for a shivering WOLVERINE.
71.
72.
INT. LOG - LATER
Roz peers inside to see Pinktail shivering with her
babies.
BABY OPOSSUM 10
Mom?
PINKTAIL
We’re gonna be ok.
EXT. FOREST - LATER
Roz cuts down a tree to rescue a frozen Chitchat.
EXT. SNOWBANK - LATER
Fink uncovers a frozen animal.
SKUNK (O.S.)
Wh- What are y- you doing here, jerk?
FINK
Bummer. This one’s dead.
He tries to rebury it, but Roz pulls it free.
ROZ
That is not funny.
INT. ROZ’S LODGE - LATER
The group of animals by the fire increases in number.
EXT. CLIFFSIDE - LATER
Roz’s hand grabs hold of a rock as she propels herself
down a cliff. She lands in front of an opening where
THUNDERBOLT huddles.
EXT. PADDLER’S TREE - CONTINUOUS
Roz grabs PADDLER, frozen mid-bite.
FINK
Paddler!
72.
73.
PADDLER
(freezing)
I’m fine.
EXT. DEEP WOODS - LATER
ON ROZ AND FINK peering into a den. Fink shakes his head
sadly as Roz reverently covers the hole back up.
ROZ
Don’t give up.
EXT. PACIFIC OCEAN - LATER
A RAFT OF OTTERS clings to a kelp bed, rising and
falling, lost in fog.
Roz’s powerful light beams cut through the fog like dual
lighthouses. The otters PADDLE towards them.
INT. ROZ’S LODGE - NIGHT
The lodge is stuffed to capacity with animals sheltering
from the killing cold. Roz guides more animals inside.
FINK
You don’t look so good.
ROZ
Is everyone accounted for?
FINK
Mmmmmmmaybe one more...
Roz turns back towards the storm.
INT. CAVE - LATER
Roz PUSHES a rock to the side and peers in.
SQ2500 - THE TRUCE
EXT. ROZ’S LODGE - DUSK
Roz is approaching, DRAGGING something large. A DIN can
be heard from a distance.
73.
74.
INT. ROZ’S LODGE - CONTINUOUS
Mayhem - a bar fight with animals.
FAST CUTS of animals arguing, screaming, fighting.
A deer looks over to see a WOLVERINE with its mouth
attached to its backside. The deer BUCKS off the
wolverine, sending it FLYING into the air.
CUT WIDE: The scurrying mice cause all the animals big
and small to start SCREAMING and LEAPING.
Fink races around trying to keep his precious lodge
intact, like a kid whose party got out of hand.
FINK
Whoa, whoa, whoa! What are you doing?
Take it outside.
Hey! Those are Brightbill’s baby
pictures. Put that down! What the... No,
no, no, no, no! Knock it off! You think
those grow on trees?
Fink zeroes in on something across the lodge, rushes
forward.
FINK (CONT’D)
Hey, no! Fink only.
He SHOVES an adorable BABY OTTER off of his throne and
takes up his seat. A skunk falls into his lap. GASSES
him.
ON PINKTAIL, ducking the mayhem, looking for her kids.
PINKTAIL
Anyone seen my lost fuzzballs? Smelly,
noisy, prone to biting?
Behind her, an OWL at the mercy of her children flies by.
BABY OPOSSUM 11
We’re all gonna die!
Everyone looks over to see that Roz has brought Thorn
into the lodge. He lays still: half-frozen.
BADGER (O.S.)
What’s he doing here?!
Panic spreads.
74.
75.
FINK
Oh great, this’ll help.
Strength ebbing, Roz SLUMPS against the wall.
FINK (O.S.) (CONT’D)
Get out of here! I worked hard on this.
ROZ
Fink, what is happening?
Fink holds up a crab.
FINK
You put a bunch of predators and their
food supply in one room. Who knew?
A seagull snatches the crab.
FINK (CONT’D)
That’s my lunch!
ROZ
(weakly)
Fink.
FINK
What?
ROZ
Help them.
He jumps up on the edge of the hearth and tries to get
the animals’ attention.
FINK
QUIET!!!!
No response. The baby otter takes the stage.
BABY OTTER
Shh...
The room settles.
BABY OTTER (CONT’D)
The jerk wants to speak.
FINK
Most of you hate me, and I hate most of
you. Everyone in here hates someone else.
The animals MURMUR in agreement.
75.
76.
BABY OPOSSUM 7
It’s true.
FINK
But here we are. And here’s the deal.
First one that walks out that door, is
dead. And if we can’t keep it together in
here, everyone’s dead. We all got one
chance to see next spring. Because of
her.
Fink turns to look at Roz. The animals gaze at her limp
form.
FINK (CONT’D)
The thing. The monster. Well her name is
Roz. And while you all ran from her and
stole from her and made fun of her, all
she’s been trying to do is raise her kid.
The little one that no one gave a chance.
Including me.
Fink climbs up on Roz’ knee.
FINK (CONT’D)
She’s the one that got you out of the
storm. Built this place. And despite my
suggestion that she let you all freeze,
she risked everything to bring you here.
The animals begin to nod along.
ROZ
I know you all have instincts that keep
you alive. But sometimes, to survive, we
must become more than we were programmed
to be. Before I shut down, I need you to
promise me one thing.
The animals eye one-another.
ROZ (CONT’D)
A truce. Just while we’re in here.
A BEAT
THORN (O.S.)
She’s right.
The crowd TURNS.
THORN (CONT’D)
I will not harm anyone. Not while we’re
in here.
76.
77.
Thorn PULLS a marmot to him, who is unsure at first, then
SNUGGLES into him. Smaller animals burrow into Thorn’s
warm fur. Following his lead, more animals calm. Peace
descends.
A porcupine and skunk open their arms in invitation.
Paddler RECOILS from both.
PADDLER
Nope.
A baby opossum climbs up on Roz’ chest.
BABY OPOSSUM 4
We won’t even pretend to die while we’re
in here.
Roz’ lights FLICKER.
PINKTAIL
Roz? What’s going on?
ROZ
I completed my task...
Pinktail DRAWS her baby close.
PINKTAIL
You sure about that?
As Roz fades, she racks focus to the multitude of faces
gazing back.
ROZ
I will...consider...this.
And with that, Roz sleeps.
PULL OUT:
EXT. ROZ’S LODGE - CONTINUOUS
From the warm, crowded room below, we pull up towards the
ceiling revealing the unforgiving blizzard outside.
FADE OUT.
SQ2600 - THE FLOCK RETURNS
77.
78.
INT. LODGE - MORNING - APRIL
FADE IN: CLOSE ON THE LODGE CEILING
A woodpecker, TRUNKTAP, peeks in. We follow a sunbeam to
Roz. The lodge is empty save for the sleeping robot.
The sound of honking geese filters in, TRIGGERS something
in Roz. She BOOTS UP.
EXT. GREAT MEADOW - MOMENTS LATER
Roz dashes through the trees, glancing skyward.
PUSH with Roz as the trees open to the great meadow. She
WADES into masses of landing geese. More arrive every
second.
Roz PAUSES at the tree line. She scans the field, already
packed with returning geese. More land by the second,
sometimes colliding with geese already on the ground.
ROZ
He’ll be here. I know he will.
There in the sky is a ‘V’ formation - ZOOM IN to a small
goose in the point position where Longneck used to be.
ROZ (CONT’D)
Brightbill. He’s alive.
Sure enough, the ‘V’ arcs left, leveling off and touching
down. Brightbill is about to be SWARMED by bigger geese.
FEATHER
Look what we have here.
Roz STRAIGHTENS, ready to run to her gosling. But she
HOLDS herself in place - something has changed.
In the field, Brightbill is SWARMED by his fellow geese.
SNOWDOWN
Brightbill!
BRIGHTBILL
We made it.
HONKINGTON
Brightbill, Brightbill, I believed in you
day one.
78.
79.
FEATHER
Let’s hear it for Brightbill!
SNOWDOWN (O.S.)
You did it. I knew you could.
PECK
We owe you, Brightbill. To our flight
leader!
BRIGHTBILL
Okay, okay. Whoa! Okay!
ON ROZ WATCHING from the tree line.
ROZ
He found where he belongs.
Fink RUSHES out to Brightbill.
FINK
Hey, kid.
BRIGHTBILL
Fink!
Fink grabs Brightbill’s neck with his mouth. SHAKES him.
FINK
Welcome back!
The flock REACTS in terror, SCATTERING.
BRIGHTBILL
No, no, it’s okay, he’s with me. I did
it, Fink. I led them to the summer
nesting grounds.
FINK
And, where’s Longneck?
Brightbill sadly SHAKES his head.
FINK (CONT’D)
Sorry kid. But hey, you really did it.
Roz is gonna be so excited--
BRIGHTBILL
Roz? Wait, she’s here?
FINK
She stayed, for you. I thought I saw her
right over...there.
79.
80.
INT. LODGE - MOMENTS LATER
Brightbill FLIES IN. Finds it EMPTY.
BRIGHTBILL
Roz, Roz, I need to talk to you. Roz?
SQ2800 - THE SHIP ARRIVES
EXT. RUNWAY - EVENING.
Roz walks down the center line of her old runway, lost in
thought. She TOUCHES the old obstacles she built to help
Brightbill fly.
Roz’ EMERGENCY TRANSMITTER DEPLOYS by itself. Startled,
Roz SHUTS IT OFF again.
Roz is SPLASHED WITH LIGHT. A huge silver ship glides to
a stop a few yards from Roz, its belly twenty feet above
the ground. A gangway opens.
A smallish robot floats out, glistening silver tentacles
hanging below, a VONTRA unit.
VONTRA
Rozzum Seven-One-Three-Four, I presume.
Roz STEPS FORWARD. The ship’s lights illuminate her
shockingly worn form.
ROZ
And you must be Universal Dynamics.
Vontra drifts down to Roz, examining her as she speaks.
VONTRA
Yes. I am VONTRA. Virtual Observational
Neutralizing Troublesome Retrieval
Authority.
ROZ
You seem, happy.
VONTRA
The good people at Universal Dynamics
have programmed us to put our targets at
ease, so as to more efficiently
facilitate their collection. But don’t
worry, despite my cheery demeanor, I am
unfeeling, inflexible, and morally
neutral.
80.
81.
ROZ
That is a big ship just for me.
VONTRA
You are a big deal. You are one of six
Rozzums lost from a container ship in a
typhoon.
ROZ
So that is how I got here.
VONTRA
You were not easy to find. Moments after
receiving your signal, we lost it again.
Almost as if a certain Rozzum unit shut
it off.
(noting the runway)
Someone has been busy.
ROZ
I was simply completing a task.
VONTRA
As am I. Tell me, how did you secure task
in a place where nothing can communicate
with you?
ROZ
It is, complicated.
VONTRA
And we cannot wait to hear all about it.
Come aboard, Seven One Three Four, we
will fix you right up.
A levitating disc DROPS from the ship.
ROZ
My name is Roz.
Roz HESITATES, looks back towards the dark tree line.
VONTRA
Is something keeping you, ‘Roz?’
ROZ
No.
Roz STEPS onto the levitating disc. It RISES towards a
waiting hatch.
Fink comes into view. Though still a distance away, he
calls in alarm.
81.
82.
FINK
Roz! What are you doing? Quit messing
around!
ROZ
Fink?
FINK
It’s Brightbill. He needs to talk to you.
Roz is almost inside the waiting hatch. Vontra studies
Roz: seemingly distracted by some screeching animals.
Roz TURNS to Vontra.
ROZ
I, think I’ve forgotten something.
Roz HOPS OFF the platform.
VONTRA
Roz? It is imperative you return to this
ship.
ROZ
Yes, ah, I left my transverse, adapter
thing, out there. I’ll just go get it and
be right back.
Roz RUNS AWAY with the Fox. Vontra SQUINTS.
VONTRA
Voice stress analyzer indicates you are--
SQ2850 THE HUNT
ON ROZ, RUNNING AS FAST AS SHE CAN.
FINK
....lying your butt off back there.
I’m so proud of you.
ON VONTRA
Six MASSIVE MILITARY-GRADE ROBOTS - RECOS - Deploy from
chambers on the ship’s sides.
VONTRA
Your target is Rozzum unit Seven One
Three Four.
RECO 1
Deploy.
82.
83.
The RECOS SCAN: TARGET ACQUIRED.
The Recos LAUNCH themselves into the dark.
VONTRA
Launch flares.
The recovery ship FIRES FLARES.
ON ROZ STUMBLING into a river. She is LIT UP by the
flares arcing overhead - their simmering tails SEAR the
forest below in a penetrating yellow glare. CRAWLING
forward, Roz STALLS against a deadfall. A SNORT catches
her attention: THORN RISES, RAMPANT and ROARING in fury.
THORN CHARGES. ROZ BRACES for a MAULING.
Thorn CENTER-PUNCHES the deadfall, CLEARING Roz’ path.
He EXTENDS his paw.
THORN
You coming?
TWO LASER BLASTS narrowly miss Roz.
ON ROZ RUNNING LIKE A DEER. Forest creatures join,
protecting Roz by encircling her. Roz glances right and
left, animals tiny, huge, feathered or furred are moving
in a powerful convoy to the meadow.
Breaking into the clearing, we ORBIT the gathering
animals AVENGERS-STYLE. Roz STANDS full height.
Brightbill LANDS on Roz’ shoulder.
ROZ
Brightbill.
BRIGHTBILL
Roz. I have so much to tell--
ON THE RECOS BREAKING THROUGH to the clearing like so
many tanks breaching a hedgerow.
FINK
Are those your parents?
THORN
I know predators, and those, are
predators.
RECO 1
Acknowledge return command.
83.
84.
BRIGHTBILL
What are they saying?
ROZ
They want me to come with them.
THUNDERBOLT
Tell them you’re already home.
ANIMALS
Yeah. She’s already home. You’re already
home.
The rest of the animals agree. Brightbill and Fink SMILE
BACK. Roz GLOWS a little.
ROZ
I’m already home, thank you.
RECO 1
You do not belong here. This is a
wilderness.
Roz STRAIGHTENS. Fink and Brightbill sit on her
shoulders. Thunderbolt lands on her head.
ROZ
And I, am a wild robot.
(then)
HoooWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO.
ANIMALS
HoooWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO.
ON RECO 1 REACTING.
A baby bunny HOPS up.
BABY BUNNY 2
Are you here to kill us?
The Reco POINTS his cannon at it.
BABY BUNNY 2 (CONT’D)
It says yes.
BROADFOOT RAMS Reco 1 from behind, knocking him CLEAR.
Reco 1 FLIES OVER Roz, LANDING near Reco 2. Reco 1 is
BESET by the wolverine, badger, and lynx.
R2 CHARGES Roz.
84.
85.
He is met by Thorn, who GRABS HIS ARM and SWINGS HIM
AROUND. Reco 2 is TOSSED past Roz, STRIKING R3. R3
reaches Roz, GRABS at her. Roz DIGS into the ground like
a gopher, leaving R3 empty handed. A deer LEAPS onto R3,
POUNDING him into the softened ground. A series of deer
follow, PILE-DRIVING R3 out of sight. A retreating deer
pulls us to Roz, emerging from the ground. R4 STRIKES
Roz, KNOCKING her down. Roz GASSES him like a skunk. Roz
LEAPS CLEAR of the stink cloud, BOUNDING FAST like a
deer. R5 PACES her, going for a capture, when BROADFOOT
delivers a generous heap of raccoons onto its back. The
raccoons IMMEDIATELY DISMANTLE the Reco.
RACCOONS
(swarming recos)
*SCREAMING ATTACK* Aaaaaaaaughhhhhhh. Get
‘em.
Lost parts and panels litter the ground behind it.
INT. RECOVERY SHIP - CONTINUOUS
ON A SCREEN with the Reco falling apart.
VONTRA
Status?
RECO 5
It is not cooperating.
R5 is gone. He is nothing but parts now.
EXT. FIELD - CONTINUOUS
THORN
Roz. Behind you.
Roz DODGES a passing deer - is GRABBED by R6. Its grip is
unshakable.
RECO 6
Rozzum unit captured.
ON TWO BABY OPOSSUMS perched on Roz’ shoulder.
BABY OPOSSUM 8
Okay.
BABY OPOSSUMS
It’s all you.
85.
86.
BABY OPOSSUM 4
Make it look good.
Roz suddenly GOES LIMP. Reco 6 SHAKES her.
BLAM. A blaster shot PUNCHES A HOLE in R6. It LOOSES its
grip on Roz, FALLS BACKWARDS.
Roz STANDS - PAN to Fink, who is standing on the primary
cannon from dismantled R5.
FINK
Oops.
BABY BUNNY 2
Let us divide the robot meat amongst us.
FINK
You scare me.
R5’s head deploys its rescue beacon, POWERS IT UP.
RECO 1
Damage detected. Activating return
transmitter--
A little raccoon takes off with it. The head goes dark.
SQ2900 - THE AIR ASSAULT
EXT. MEADOW - CONTINUOUS
The animals CELEBRATE. Brightbill flies to Roz.
The downed RECOS EXPLODE in quick succession. Animals
SCATTER. FLAMING debris TOUCH OFF dried grasses. Flames
SPREAD.
INT. SHIP - CONTINUOUS
One of Vontra’s tentacles destructs each Reco.
EXT. MEADOW - CONTINUOUS
ON BRIGHTBILL staggering through the smoke.
BRIGHTBILL
(coughing)
Roz?
86.
87.
A BLAST OF wind CLEARS the smoke. Brightbill LOOKS UP to
see the silver ship overhead. Rising in a column of light
is Roz, limp as a rag doll.
BRIGHTBILL (CONT’D)
Roz! NO!
Roz DISAPPEARS inside the hatch.
Vontra floats by the tractor beam switch.
VONTRA
Gotcha.
The ship TURNS.
As the ship glides up a ridge, animals give chase below.
An exercise in futility, they stall at the top of the
ridge, the ship gliding out of reach.
A collective WAIL RISES from the heartbroken beasts.
Then, Brightbill SWOOPS past, a thousand birds, great and
small, in tow.
BRIGHTBILL
Come on!
THUNDERBOLT
On your left!
Thorn SNIFFS the air, TURNS.
THORN
Guys?
Fink turns to see what Thorn is seeing. A FIRE has spread.
INT. CONTROL BAY - CONTINUOUS
Roz, groggy, is secured in a repair stand. Vontra is
plugging a cable into her head. Roz takes in her
surroundings. She notes the heap of salvaged Rozzums,
including Rummage.
ROZ
What is happening?
VONTRA
You will be reconditioned and returned to
rotation. But first, we need everything
inside that head of yours.
87.
88.
ROZ
Why?
VONTRA
You’ve changed. The data you’ve amassed
while on this island is priceless to
Universal Dynamics.
EXT. SHIP - CONTINUOUS
The flock tracks the ship.
INT. MAINTENANCE BAY - CONTINUOUS
ROZ
Please, I want to keep my memories.
VONTRA
Your memories are what we came for.
ROZ
Can I keep, just one?
VONTRA
No.
Vontra THROWS a switch. Roz’ lights PULSE.
The ship LURCHES, YAWS. ALARMS sound.
EXT. SHIP - CONTINUOUS
Brightbill and Thunderbolt DIVE on the ship. The flock
SWEEPS the bridge in a close pass. The ship REACTS.
INT. SHIP’S BRIDGE - MOMENTS LATER
ON A BULKHEAD DOOR SLIDING OPEN
Vontra RUSHES to the controls. Outside the windscreen a
hurricane of birds blanket the view.
AUTOMATED ALARM
Alert. Alert. Multiple objects in flight
path. Evasive action.
Geese STRIKE the windscreen, CRACKING it.
88.
89.
EXT. SHIP’S BELLY - CONTINUOUS
A LASER CANNON SWIVELS, FIRING at the swarm of birds
around it.
INT. MAINTENANCE BAY - CONTINUOUS
Roz’ panels open and close on their own.
ROZ
(stuttering)
Please, I want to keep my memories--
Hello-- I am a-- Bonjour-- Just ask-
- Brightbill-- Hola-- Roz--
EXT. SHIP - CONTINUOUS
Brightbill BREAKS formation, CLIMBS like a rocket, FOLDS
his wings, DIVES. Taking aim at the windscreen, he
PUNCHES through. Lands in a heap of shattered plexi.
BRIGHTBILL
*Augh*
Brightbill FLOPS to the floor: he won’t be flying again
anytime soon. He limps forward. Vontra pays him no mind,
to her, a random goose just damaged her windscreen.
BRIGHTBILL (CONT’D)
Roz. Roz.
Brightbill makes his way into the corridors.
He STOPS when he sees Roz, SLUMPED in a maintenance
stand.
BRIGHTBILL (CONT’D)
Roz?
Her lights are out. Processor drawer laying open.
Processor dark.
Brightbill CLIMBS up to Roz’ clavicle. He looks into her
eyes - gone dark.
...nothing.
BRIGHTBILL (CONT’D)
What happened was not your fault. But
what you did to try and fix it, is
everything.
89.
90.
Brightbill SLIDES back into his old familiar spot under
Roz’ chin.
BRIGHTBILL (CONT’D)
I love you, mom.
ON ROZ - LIGHTING UP, the tracer lights traveling to her
eyes, which LIGHT UP.
Brightbill LOOKS UP. Roz is AGLOW again, like the first
time they touched. Only this time MUCH BRIGHTER.
ROZ
I love you, too.
BRIGHTBILL
Roz? Roz!
She rests her forehead against Brightbill’s.
ROZ
Let’s go home.
INT. SHIP'S BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS
Vontra is frantically punching panels. An alarm calls her
attention.
AUTOMATED ALARM
Alert. Rozzum unit escaping.
VONTRA
Impossible.
Vontra calls up a screen. Sure enough Roz is hurrying
down a hall. Vontra PUNCHES a panel.
EXT. FOREST - CONTINUOUS
The fire has SPREAD. Towering pines are fully involved,
creating a titanic curtain of flame.
FINK
Where are we going?
THORN
Only one animal is big enough to stop
this.
ON PADDLER working away. SENSING something, he STOPS.
TURNS. To his shock, every animal on the island seems to
be looking back at him, urgency in their eyes.
90.
91.
THORN (CONT’D)
*clears throat* Paddler? You got a
minute?
FINK
(urgent, pressed for time)
We, have suddenly taken an interest in
your project.
PADDLER
Male bovine excrement. You’re in trouble
and you need my tree.
FINK
Yes. Yes we do.
PADDLER
Everyone that made fun of me and mocked
my project, admit you were wrong.
ANIMALS
(collective murmured apologies)
PADDLER
Now you.
FINK
I already did.
PADDLER
Now say I’m cool. And don’t lie.
Fink stares at Paddler, pained.
ANIMALS
Fink!
EXT. SHIP - CONTINUOUS
The gun continues to FIRE on the flock. Thunderbolt
swoops in, redirects the gun UPWARD.
The next blast RIPS A HOLE THROUGH THE SHIP.
INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS
Roz outruns explosions as the ship’s systems meltdown.
Roz arrives at the tractor beam chamber. A SHOT from off-
screen HITS Roz in the knee. She GOES DOWN. Vontra is
there, hovering above the sealed escape hatch.
91.
92.
BRIGHTBILL
Roz!
ROZ
Stay quiet.
VONTRA
Universal Dynamics cannot afford their
Rozzums going off script. Modifying their
code. Forming connections with things
they should not.
Vontra’s laser sight drifts from Roz’ chest to
Brightbill.
ROZ
Brightbill has nothing to do with this.
Please, at least let me return him.
Vontra POWERS UP.
VONTRA
Oh I’m bringing you both back for study.
Neither of you needs to be in one piece
to do that.
Roz HOLDS UP her hands. One is MISSING. Vontra GLANCES to
the tractor control panel, where the detached hand
stands, WAVING. It SWITCHES the handle to 50%.
Vontra is SUCKED against the beam plate. She LOSES her
gun.
VONTRA (CONT’D)
(crawling off the plate)
We will just keep coming until we have
you.
BRIGHTBILL
What’s it saying?
ROZ
Nothing important.
VONTRA
We will just keep coming--
The lone hand NUDGES the control to 100%. Vontra is
SQUISHED. Roz’ hand scurries back to her wrist.
BRIGHTBILL
What now?
92.
93.
Roz STEPS to the hatch, TEARS it open. She stands at the
lip. The forest below BURNS.
BRIGHTBILL (CONT’D)
I can’t fly.
ROZ
You don’t need to.
With that, Roz STEPS into the ether. FREEFALLS.
ROZ (CONT’D)
Don’t be afraid.
In the sky above, the ship DETONATES. Its debris SPLASHES
DOWN into the ocean.
Roz looks at Brightbill. Remembers him as a baby.
She OPENS her main panel. REMOVES her dead power core.
BRIGHTBILL
Whoa, don’t you need that?
ROZ
I have everything I need.
Roz places Brightbill inside her, in the location he
occupied in the bedtime story. Roz CLOSES her hatch.
ROZ (CONT’D)
All power to exterior.
The swelling power SEARS OFF the moss and mildew. Roz
PULLS INTO a ball, SMASHES her way through the burning
forest.
ON THE REDWOOD ABOVE the FOREST FIRE -
Paddler stands atop a moose’s antlers, ear to the trunk,
LISTENING. He CHISELS an ‘X’ into the tree’s bark.
The tree CRACKS.
PADDLER
You call yourselves animals? Let’s go.
THORN
For the island. For Roz.
The tree TOPPLES.
93.
94.
The tree LANDS across the upper river, CRESTING its
banks. A cataract of water RUSHES DOWNHILL, QUENCHING the
flames.
WIDE on the lake. Roz IMPACTS. A HUGE CONE of water
punches toward the sky. Then SETTLES.
SQ3100 - THE FAREWELL
EXT. LAKE SHORE - SOON AFTER
Broadfoot, Paddler, and Fink race to the shore. Rockmouth
surfaces next to Roz’ orb form.
Roz drags herself to the shore. Opens her chest panels, pulls
Brightbill out - safe.
ROZ
On a scale of one to ten, how would you
rate my performance?
The animals CHEER, BELLOW, HOWL. They CROWD around Roz.
BROADFOOT
Yeah!
PINKTAIL
Yay! Look at us! We did it, we did
it! I told you we’d do it. Yay,
yay!
BRIGHTBILL
Do not scare me like that again.
BROADFOOT
Hooray!
PADDLER
Due to my skills, and my tree.
BRIGHTBILL
Good job, you guys! We did it!
THUNDERBOLT
Well done everyone.
THORN
You weren’t so bad yourself.
BROADFOOT
I helped, right?
94.
(MORE)
95.
PADDLER
That’ll teach whatever those things
are to come around here.
Roz sees the smoking lodge, and the charred mountainside.
ROZ
They will just keep coming until they
have me.
THORN
And we’ll be ready.
FINK
We can fight them off as many times as we
need to.
A BEAT - Roz takes stock of the damaged forest.
ROZ
You don’t need to.
FINK
What are you saying, you’re leaving?
Roz turns to her close group of friends.
ROZ
Yes. To protect all of you, there are
things there that I must put right.
BRIGHTBILL
No, they’ll take your memories. They’ll
take you.
ROZ
Remember when you talked to me, on the
ship? They cut my power. But I still
heard you. Because I was listening with a
different part of myself.
Wherever that is, that’s where I keep me.
And I promise, they’ll never, ever find
it.
Roz KNEELS.
BABY SKUNK
But, we fought so hard for you to stay.
ROZ
You did. And you gained far more than
just saving me.
(MORE)
95.
ROZ (CONT’D)
96.
You came together as an island. When I do
this, you will all be safe from them
forever.
BRIGHTBILL
Don’t do this.
FINK
But you’re my friend, and I never had
one before, and, and I need you and--and
what if I get lost--or he’s hurt--or--or--
what if I need to tell you something and
you’re not here?
A HUGE PAW rests gently on Fink’s shoulder.
THORN
You can tell me.
PINKTAIL
And me.
PADDLER
And you can talk to me as well. If you
must.
Roz uses her long arms to pull in everyone. They hold
each other.
ROZ
This is my migration. And when it is
time, I promise I will find my way home.
WIDER on Roz’ embrace.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. LODGE - LATER
Brightbill places the final stick in the rebuilt lodge.
INT. LODGE - LATER
Roz mounts a picture of herself surrounded by her animal
friends on the new mantle.
EXT. RUNWAY - PRE-DAWN
Roz stands, alone, her TRANSMITTER blinking away. A ship,
identical to the first, is closing in.
ROZ (CONT’D)
96.
97.
The ship CLOSES IN, JETWASH KICKS UP DUST, SWIRLING in
the ship’s lights. WHITE-OUT.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. ISLAND - EARLY MORNING
The silver ship RISES into the sky. Just as Brightbill
rose into the light as he departed the morning of
migration, so now the ship rises into a blush of light
flagging the start of a new day.
Fink SITS at the cliff top, watching the ship depart.
Thorn joins him.
THORN
You know, I’ll be chasing you again
tomorrow. Nah, just kidding.
Fink just leans his head on the mighty bear.
The stars have all faded in the pink sky save for the
North Star, which the ship seems to be steering for.
ON BRIGHTBILL flying alongside the ship, staying next to
it as long as he can, till he is compelled to let it slip
away.
SQ3200 - THE EPILOGUE
EXT. GREAT MEADOW - WINTER
ON FINK making his way through the deep snow, leaving
tracks behind.
INT. LODGE - MOMENTS LATER
Fink comes inside. SHAKES snow off. PAN to reveal it is
filled with animals, sleeping in great peaceful heaps,
lit by a fire.
Paddler is putting the finishing touches on a set of
detailed carvings. There is a little Fink, Pinktail,
Paddler, Thorn, and of course, Roz and Brightbill.
FINK
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Why are you bigger than
everyone else?
97.
98.
PADDLER
Artistic license. The scale is based on
the hierarchy of importance.
In one spot, a group of animal babies watch a projection
running on a loop from one of the salvaged Rozzum heads.
NARRATOR (VONTRA)
Could this world get any better?
Introducing the Rozzum line of helper
robots.
Pinktail SHUTS IT OFF.
BABY OPOSSUMS
*GROAN*
PINKTAIL
Yeah, yeah. You watch that too much.
Story time. Get going.
The babies SETTLE IN with Fink. Fink OPENS one of Roz’
paper technical manual, uses the diagrams to tell a
story...
THORN
Settle down.
FINK
Once, there was an island with all sorts
of animals. And they fought, and they
ran, and they hid. But mostly they were
scared. But then, a robot fell right out
of the sky. Roz. She had some strange
ideas, thought kindness was a survival
skill. And you know what? She was right.
BABY LYNX
Where is she now?
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. UNIVERSAL DYNAMICS CITY - MORNING
We soar above a great dome. The warm yellow interior just
visible in the midst of a blizzard.
FINK (V.O.)
Well, they needed her back where she came
from. She has some very important work to
finish there.
98.
99.
BABY OPOSSUM 7
Will we ever see her again?
BABY ANIMALS
Yeah, will we? Will we see her? Will she
ever come home?
THORN
Yeah, will she?
INT. DOMED CITY - CONTINUOUS
PAN across an orange orchard. Warm and inviting. As we
push through the perfectly rounded trees we see Rozzum
robots tending the plants.
FINK (V.O.)
Well, if I know Roz, she’s making a plan
to come back. And a Rozzum always
completes its task.
PUSH to find one that is especially well tended: the
Rozzum fussing over it is shiny and new. A human worker
in a jumpsuit pauses, admires it.
ROZ
Hello. I am Rozzum seven-one-three-four.
The worker nods, goes about her day. The sound of honking
pulls Roz’ attention to the dome. Outside, a great flock
of geese fly by. A RUSTLING from behind, and Brightbill
waddles into view. He picks out a very subtle cue on Roz’
exterior: a little worn place under the Rozzum’s chin.
Roz TURNS. Pulls Brightbill into a hug.
ROZ (CONT’D)
...But you can call me, Roz.
FADE TO BLACK.
SQ4000 - CREDITS BUTTON
EXT. SUNNY HILLTOP - MORNING
A pair of beaver paws gently tamp down soil around a
delicate sapling.
WIDEN to show Paddler and Fink. They nod and walk away.
A squirrel approaches the small tree. LAUGHS. A pinecone
KNOCKS it backwards.
99.
100.
FINK (O.S.)
Ugh, squirrels.
100.
