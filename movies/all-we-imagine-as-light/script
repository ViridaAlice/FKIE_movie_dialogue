DOCTOR SUPRIYA (O.S.)
(quietly)
The heart is fragile.
DOCTOR SUPRIYA (CONT’D)
(soft, but firm)
Take a deep breath.
KAKI
(breathing in)
Aaaah.
DOCTOR SUPRIYA
Breathe out.
KAKI
Haaaaaa.
SUPRIYA
Nurse Prabha tells me that you have been
making trouble... is it true?
PRABHA
(to Kaki)
Tell Dr. Supriya... Why did you hide your
medication under your pillow?
KAKI
I won’t take them!
KAKI (CONT’D)
(mutters again)
I won’t take them... any more.
DOCTOR SUPRIYA
(concerned)
What is wrong?
PRABHA
She told me that the pills are giving her bad
dreams.
Kaki turns to Prabha and gives her a dirty look.
DOCTOR SUPRIYA
I’ll give you something for your sleep...
(taking the chart, writing another
prescription)
Ok?
KAKI
NO! Not ok!
DOCTOR SUPRIYA
What is the matter?
KAKI
(plaintive)
Please doctor... I want to go home... please...
(warming up again)
Every night he comes, just after dinner when I
watch TV .
DOCTOR SUPRIYA
Who comes?
KAKI
Jairam! My husband! ...I was watching kaun
banega karodpati (Who wants to be a
millionaire) I started to hear some sounds... I
didn’t see anything at first. Mr Bacchan was
talking on the show - you know his voice
always calms me down? .. And ... and that
horrible smell... of tobacco. I turned and
Jairam! He was sitting on that chair...
KAKI (CONT’D)
Well... one can’t really call it sitting. He
was... ummm... hovering. You see doctor... he
had no legs! He was only a torso!
(nodding her head in dismay)
Prabha turns to Kaki, concerned.
KAKI (CONT’D)
What torture has fallen on me at this age?
INT. HOSPITAL, RECEPTION - DAY2 2
On a side table in the Hospital reception, an instrument sterilisation machine
hums as it spews clouds of vapour. A calendar above has an image of a baby
with rosy cheeks that gapes, mouth ajar.
3.
4.
Three middle-aged women wearing Burqas sit on a sofa in the waiting room,
sweating and fanning themselves from the unbearable monsoon heat.
A YOUNG WOMAN (early 20s), a patient, sitting across the reception table, is
answering questions, as if it is an interview. She has a petit frame and covers
her head with her sari. Her olive skin has small red blotches caused by sun
burn. A child in her arms plays with an auspicious black thread around her
neck.
ANU (O.S.)
And the older one, how old is he?
YOUNG WOMAN
Ummm...He is this much
(indicating the child’s height)
Anu (23), a nurse on the other side of the reception desk, is filling a form on a
clipboard. She is dressed in the same blue sari uniform as Prabha. She is an
attractive woman, with a sharp chin, and full lips and long curly hair.
YOUNG WOMAN (CONT’D)
There is one more child... I had her last
month.
ANU
Oh...So three children in total?
The Young Woman nods and the cloth on her head slips off. She adjusts it in a
childish gesture, her adult image suddenly falling apart, and making her seem a
child in a woman’s body.
ANU (CONT’D)
How old are you?
The Young Woman is silent. She bites her lower lip.
YOUNG WOMAN
Maybe 25... or 24... ummm...
Anu, stops writing on her clipboard and looks up at the Young Woman.
YOUNG WOMAN (O.S.) (CONT’D)
(hesitant)
22... yes... I am sure...
Anu rolls her eyes, bored with this mundane activity she has done many times.
4.
5.
YOUNG WOMAN (O.S.) (CONT’D)
(hesitant)
Nurse...??
(low voice)
Nurse, the girls told me there is a prize?
Curious, Anu looks up, raising her eyebrows.
YOUNG WOMAN (CONT’D)
(leaning in to be closer to Anu)
Prize for the...you know?
She makes a pair of scissors with her index and middle finger and snips at the
air.
ANU
(thinks about it)
Vasectomy?
The Young Woman nods.
Anu brings her chair forward, as if she is giving some classified information.
ANU (CONT’D)
The government will give you ration for one
month and a plastic bucket if he agrees to the
vasectomy...
YOUNG WOMAN (O.S.)
(cutting her short)
I told my husband..but he is scared. He says
he won’t be able to lift heavy things if he gets
it done. You know he is a brick layer? It makes
them lose their strength!
Anu leans back in her chair and contemplates what to do. She gets up. She
goes to the side of the room to the shelf. She quickly takes out some pills and
folds her palm around them.
Sitting back down on the chair, she thrusts the pills into the Young Woman’s
hand in a way that it is a secret operation - like a drug dealer.
ANU
Take it every day. If you want another child,
stop taking it one month in -
5.
6.
YOUNG WOMAN
(shaking her head)
No NO! I'll die before I have one more.
The Young Woman examines the contraceptive pills. Anu takes out the form
again and starts filling it as before.
YOUNG WOMAN (CONT’D)
How much for this?
Anu waves her hand as if to say ‘nothing’.
ANU
When did you get your period last?
INT. HOSPITAL, STAFF ROOM - DAY3 3
The staffroom is covered in white tiles and large panelled old fashioned glass
windows. Dark green curtains are kept open. Through them, the large
construction site is visible across the street with its red cranes. A short,
Maharashtrian woman, PARVATY (60s) wearing a neatly pinned ochre yellow
uniform sari watches patiently as a pot of milky chai boils on the stovetop.
Three nurses, in their early 20, sit around a long wooden table in the
staffroom. All of them are dressed in the same blue uniform. NURSE 1 has the
newspaper opened in front of her as she casually goes through the movie
listings.
NURSES 2
Please lets not go for a crime film this
time!...I can’t sleep at night!! ...I want to go
for a romantic movie!
NURSE 3
Ooh! There is the one with that dreamy actor,
whats his name?
NURSE 1
(scanning the paper)
Shane Nigam! He is... so cute!
NURSE 2
Nurse Prabha, which movie do you want to
watch?!
6.
7.
Sitting by herself at the other end of the staffroom table, Prabha hurriedly eats
her lunch from a small plastic lunchbox. She looks at the nurse.
NURSE 1 (O.S.)
Yes Nurse Prabha, you pick!!
NURSE 3 (O.S.)
She won’t come with us... Nurse Prabha
doesn’t like movies.
NURSE 1 (O.S.)
Please Nurse! You must come!
PRABHA
(smiling)
You girls go ahead....
A murmur of disappointment.
The nurses continue their chatter. Prabha finishes her lunch and hastily packs
her box. She turns to look at Parvaty, the cook.
Parvaty is still watching the tea boil. Prabha goes over to her.
PRABHA (CONT’D)
(softly so only she can hear)
I had a word with doctor Supriya. She has
spoken to her lawyer friend... He said he will
have a look at your case!
Not responding, Parvaty takes the tea off the stove.
PRABHA (CONT’D)
He won’t even charge a penny!
Parvaty pours the chai into small porcelain cups, not responding.
PRABHA (CONT’D)
I thought... I thought it would make you
happy.
Parvaty turns to Prabha. She puts her hands into her ochre sari blouse and takes
out a small newspaper packet. She unfurls it and it has some red herbal powder
inside. She scoops some into her mouth and start chewing it.
7.
8.
PARVATY
It won’t do much good..
(chewing)
Last night... the builders sent a goon to my
house, isn’t it? Rascal started to threaten me!
Prabha gasps.
PARVATY (CONT’D)
(soft and dramatic)
He said he was there to give me a warning...
If I didn’t leave the house by the end of the
month....
PRABHA
My god !
Parvaty nods slowly. Frowning, Prabha thinks about what to do.
PRABHA (CONT’D)
You better stay at my place...its too
dangerous!
PARVATY
Don’t worry nurse... that goon won’t show his
face to me any time soon
Parvaty looks up at Prabha and grins.
PRABHA
Oh no Parvaty, what did you do?
Parvaty, still grinning, swings her arm in the air and chuckles as if to indicate
that she took a swing at the goon! Prabha stares at her wide eyed but then
breaks into a smile in admiration.
PRABHA (CONT’D)
Talk to the lawyer... it can’t go on like this.
NURSE 2 (O.S.)
Parvaty Mausi (Aunty), when will the tea be
ready?
Parvaty turns to them and lifts the tray with the porcelain tea cups. She offers
one to Prabha.
8.
9.
PARVATY
Sit for a bit...have some tea and go.
Prabha looks at her watch. She nods.
INT. STAFFROOM - DAY4 4
Parvaty keeps cups of tea in front of each of the seated nurses. Leaning against
the counter, Prabha also drinks the tea.
Offscreen someone enters the staffroom.
NURSE 1 (O.S.)
Come in Dr. Manoj. Have some sweets...
Prabha looks up and her expression softens. A smile appears on her lips.
DOCTOR MANOJ, a young Malayali sonographer , is in the middle of the room.
He is of medium height, and a thick, tidy mop of hair, brown-rimmed glasses
and eyes with long curly eyelashes. His small moustache is trimmed neatly. He
is not conventionally handsome but is pleasant looking and a little overweight.
He wears a white doctor’s coat.
DR. MANOJ
From home?
NURSE 1
Uh huh..
He takes one sweet politely from the box on the table and pops it into his
mouth.
DR. MANOJ
Oh very nice!
(munching)
I miss the food from home.
NURSE 1
Doctor, it is time you get a wife who can cook
all the specialities for you!
The other nurses giggle.
9.
10.
DR. MANOJ
You don’t have to worry, my mother has made
this her life mission!
Dr Manoj walks to the counter close to where Parvaty is now chopping onions.
He picks up a cup of tea from the tray. He takes a few steps towards Prabha.
DR. MANOJ.
(leaning in a bit so only she can
hear)
My cooking lessons are not going as planned,
Nurse.
PRABHA
(kindly)
You have to work hard at it!
NURSE 2 (O.S.)
(interrupting)
Doctor, have you got your horoscope checked?
Dr. Manoj shakes his head smiling mildly.
DR. MANOJ
I don’t believe in the stars.
NURSE 2
It is not a matter of belief Doctor! It is fate!
NURSE 1
You don’t want to make a mistake do you? A
lifetime is a long time.
The nurses turn to the doctor for a response.
Dr. Manoj, now sniffing and has tears streaming down his face. He takes out a
handkerchief and wipes them, his eyes are red.
NURSE 3
You don’t have to cry doctor, we will find
someone for you.
Helplessly, Dr. Manoj points at Parvaty’s onions. Everyone turns to her.
NURSE 3 (CONT’D)
Seems like Parvaty has put a spell on you!
10.
11.
All the Nurses surround Dr Manoj. Unseen to them, in the door at the back,
Kaki hobbles by slowly. No one notices her.
Poor Dr. Manoj’s face has become red. He moves as far away from the onions as
possible. He pats his face. He smiles apologetically. Prabha takes a nearby stool
and makes him sit on it. She looks at the helpless doctor and smiles kindly.
DOCTOR MANOJ
(still wiping)
Thanks nurse.
Suddenly, a YOUNG NURSE (20s) comes to the staffroom door and peers inside.
She is worried and out of breath.
YOUNG NURSE
Nurse Prabha?
Prabha turns to the Young Nurse.
YOUNG NURSE (CONT’D)
Nurse Prabha....come fast! Your.. patient has
fallen!
INT. HOSPITAL, CORRIDOR - DAY5 5
Many nurses - male and female, in identical uniforms, look at what is
happening off screen, in a well-arranged corridor.
Prabha’s shoes tik-tok on the red clay tiled floor as she runs towards them.
The entire gathered crowd turns in sync to looks at her approaching. No one
speaks. Prabha joins them and they all unanimously shift their attention to Kaki
who is offscreen on the floor.
Sounds of struggle.
KAKI (O.S.)
(struggling)
Let me go!
A big built, thin-haired handsome MALE NURSE holds the fragile Kaki under her
arms, trying to lift her like a sack of sand, but the wiggling old woman keeps
slipping out of his hold. The poor man looks exasperated. It is a comical sight.
11.
12.
KAKI (CONT’D)
Don't touch me... Don't...Don’t you dare!! Let
me go! I am going home!
The nurses stand around watching nervously, but unable to do anything.
MALE NURSE (O.S.)
Ouch!
The Male Nurse recoils backwards, holding his forearm.
MALE NURSE (CONT’D)
(defeated)
She bit me.
Prabha turns back to Kaki sternly. She has had enough.
She marches towards the older woman. She stares down at her. Kaki is now
lying flat on the floor, and has spread out her arms as if she is holding on to it.
Kaki looks up at Prabha. Kaki’s expression softens.
KAKI
Nurse.... What took you so long? Tell all these
people that I want to go home.
(sadly)
I don't want to die here...Please!
PRABHA
No one is dying Kaki. Come... let me take you
back.
Kaki stares at Prabha and then finally gives in. She lifts her arms. Prabha holds
her gently, lifting her up. She indicates to the others to bring nearer the wheel
chair and carefully manoeuvres Kaki into it.
Kaki is wheeled away.
Prabha looks sternly at the other nurses.
PRABHA (CONT’D)
Don't you’ll have somewhere to be?
Embarrassed, they go back to work.
12.
13.
INT. RECEPTION - LATE AFTERNOON6 6
The reception waiting area that was filled with patients earlier, is now empty.
A man in a hospital uniform leans against his mopping stick and nonchalantly
watches the TV hung from the ceiling. A news anchor on TV warns of a severe
Monsoon storm that is about to hit the city.
Anu rests her head on the reception table, absently watching the empty room.
She notices a stethoscope next to her. She slips it on her ears.
A dull hum all around smothers the other sounds.
Taking the other end of the stethoscope, she places it on the flower vase in
front of her, listening to its ‘heartbeat’.
The dull hum continues.
She then places it on the paperweight, ‘listening’ to it. But there is no change
in sound. With a slow, deliberate movement, she turns the stethoscope and
listens to her own heart.
Instead of the heartbeat, the sound of large ocean waves crashing on the beach
resonates through it.
Anu closes her eyes.
EXT. HOSPITAL TERRACE - LATE AFTERNOON7 7
The sound of a whipping sail of a small boat on waves.
Track left to right on the terrace over pink identical hospital gowns hung on a
wire until it stops to frame two of them fluttering in the wind.
On this, TEXT messages appear in yellow between Anu and SHIAZ.
ANU
R U gng 2 pick me up 2day?
SHIAZ
Ya.. same spot.
ANU
:( IMA So bored
13.
14.
It starts to drizzle. Footsteps are heard running. A nurse rushes in and pulls
down the gowns before they get wet. Mumbai city is revealed behind them -
tall skyscrapers, covered in a sheet of blue-grey rain! On it, more text appears.
SHIAZ
Cnt talk now, boss is giving dirty looks
ANU
I’ll send U somthng to cheer U up :p
Slow track on the terrace towards the tall buildings that are slightly out of
focus as if they are merging with the rain.
Text:
MP3 AUDIO SENT FROM ANU TO SHIAZ.
ANU (V.O.)
(recorded voice on the
microphone adjusts)
oh wondrous rain clouds...don’t thunder too
loudly... my lover is sleeping ...
Her sweet voice flows over the sheets of rain on the city - cascading all over
the skyline and the clouds.
The work in the construction site has stopped and the men sit below it.
ANU (V.O.)
(singing)
Clouds with your naughty ways, are only
causing a flutter in my heart. My lover is far
away and maybe you can carry this message
to him.
INT. HOSPITAL - EVENING8 8
Anu’s singing continues.
The rain is comes down relentlessly in torrential sheets seen through a frosted
window of an empty corridor of the hospital. A fish tank with a small red scuba
diver stuck inside a plastic shark. Other fish swim around.
Thunder cracks.
14.
15.
Parvaty pushes a tray with food and stops briefly to look at the rain as it comes
down on the construction site.
CUT TO:
Three young nurses look at their phones, the light illuminating their faces.
Behind them, in a window, the sky has turned a brilliant blue in the monsoon
evening.
Anu’s song comes to an end.
INT. HOSPITAL, KAKI’S ROOM - EVENING9 9
Prabha inspects Kaki’s open mouth to make sure she has swallowed her
medication.
PRABHA
Are you hiding them under your tongue?
Kaki sticks out her tongue. Prabha straightens up. Kaki closes her mouth.
PRABHA (CONT’D)
Good.
The door opens and Anu looks inside.
ANU
Prabha, I am going. Do yo need anything?
PRABHA (O.S.)
No...... you go ahead. I’ll see you at home.
Anu nods and leaves.
Prabha helps Kaki lay down. She neatens her pillow. On the TV offscreen the
sound of ‘Who Wants to Be a Millionaire’ is playing.
KAKI
Oh I think this contestant is going lose big!
PRABHA
How do you know?
KAKI
She looks too ugly!
15.
16.
Prabha smiles at Kaki’s disdain. Kaki looks up at Prabha.
KAKI (O.S.) (CONT’D)
Nurse... I don't want to sleep alone.
PRABHA
Don’t worry, I will be here till you fall asleep.
INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT10 10
Gingerly Prabha closes Kaki’s room door. The corridor is empty and many of the
lights have been turned off.
Prabha walks down the staircase with her purse. She walks past the reception
where a nurse is casually looking at her phone. Seeing Prabha the nurse
straightens up and hides a yawn.
INT. HOSPITAL, FOYER - NIGHT11 11
Prabha holding up her sari with one hand and her red umbrella with the other,
walks out of the Hospital gate.
Dr. Manoj, dressed in a full-body, yellow plastic rain protected pant and jacket,
waits under the hospital awning. He smiles as Prabha comes out, as if he was
expecting her.
DR. MANOJ
Nurse Prabha.
She watches him approach.
PRABHA
Sorry doctor. I lost track of time.
DR. MANOJ
Its ok... I was not in a hurry.
I/E. SKYWALK - NIGHT12 12
Prabha and Dr. Manoj walk on the deserted skywalk towards the railway
station. Tube-lights illuminate the metal skywalk, creating pools of white light
in the darkness.
16.
17.
The rain falls gently on the plastic roof.
DR. MANOJ
Nurse, I think I should return your recipe
books. I tried many dishes but none of them
turned out very well...
PRABHA
With some practice you will improve.
DR. MANOJ
You don’t have to be polite, Nurse.
PRABHA
Well, maybe I will have to try them to know if
you are exaggerating!
DR. MANOJ
I think cooking has less to do with recipes
than the hand that makes them... mine are
like the tentacles of an octopus!
He spreads his hands and shows them to her. She looks down at them and
smiles. Light from nearby hoarding creates a soft red reflection on her face.
Some nurses in uniform walk past them.
Prabha looks up at them, stepping a few steps away from Dr. Manoj. They
continue walking ahead in silence. They stop as they reach a fork in the
skywalk.
PRABHA
I will see you tomorrow doctor. Don’t forget
to get me something to taste!
DR. MANOJ
Umm... Nurse, I have something, I wanted to
show you.
He rummages through his yellow raincoat pants, the plastic making an odd
sound.He pulls down his plastic pants in an odd gesture and rummages through
his cotton trousers bellow. She is mildly amused at his endearing action. He
pulls out a little book and hands it to her. She looks at it, turning it in her hand.
17.
18.
It is imprinted with a design of yellow roses. She is about to open it when he
stops her -
DR. MANOJ (CONT’D)
No no Nurse! Don’t open it now.
(hesitant)
Its a ... a poem...
PRABHA
Poem?
DR. MANOJ
(sheepishly)
There is a writing competition in our monthly
journal. I thought I will give it a shot.
PRABHA
Oh! I didn’t know you are also a writer!
DR. MANOJ
(shyly)
It is just a hobby.
Prabha nods and puts it in her purse.
The sound of the train again.
Prabha looks towards it and then back at Dr. Manoj
DR. MANOJ.
See you tomorrow Nurse
She walks away, smiling to herself. Dr. Manoj watches her go.
EXT. STATION - NIGHT13 13
A desolate station with only a few lights. A train approaches from below the
skywalk, the headlights illuminates the empty, glistening tracks.
Prabha stands at the platform, the light from the approaching train illuminates
her face with a soft golden haze.
18.
19.
INT. LOCAL TRAIN - NIGHT14 14
The city passes by through the window of a train. Prabha sits near the window,
Dr. Manoj’s poetry book on her lap.
Prabha gazes out the train window at the city passing by in a swirl of lights
sparkling in the rain. The city lights illuminate his tired but happy face.
The lights from the windows flash over other girls too who sit in the female-
only coach of the train- some dozing, some listening to their earphones, one of
them is cutting vegetables on her laptop bag, many of them wear uniform or
work clothes.
INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT15 15
Prabha makes her way through the shabby apartment building. The walls are
painted bright pink. She holds her sari to avoid getting it wet from the water
that is dripping down the staircase.
She stops at the landing.
PRABHA
(softly)
What are you doing here?
KOSHU, her black cat, is huddled in the basket of a child’s green bicycle in the
corridor. Prabha scoops Koshu up in her arms. The cat is visibly pregnant.
Lovingly, Prabha carries her in her arms.
PRABHA (CONT’D)
How did you get out?
She climbs up to the floor above, to her own apartment.
INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT16 16
The apartment is dimly lit with a single tungsten bulb hung from the ceiling.
The kitchen is full of steel utensils neatly arranged on the wall. The tiles are
chipped and been replaced by mismatched ones.
Prabha leans against the kitchen counter to shut the window that has come
undone. She puts on a small latch at the bottom and makes sure that the
window is securely closed. Koshu, the black cat, watches her.
19.
20.
PRABHA
Don’t try to run off again, my princess!
Koshu meows.
Prabha sits on the chair along the tiny dining-table. She takes off her pumps,
releasing her tired feet. She leans against the wall, briefly closing her eyes.
Koshu hops on the table and rubs herself against Prabha’s arm. Prabha lovingly
caresses Koshu.
INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT17 17
The radio plays an old movie song which mixes with the sound of the rain.
Prabha stands besides the stove and massages a fish with turmeric. The grey
shiny scales turn a vibrant shade of yellow. The oil boils in the pan as Prabha
prepares dinner.
Sound of a key turning.
The front door opens and Anu comes in. Her clothes are dripping wet from the
rain! Prabha turns to look. Before she can say anything, Anu quickly rushes to
the bedroom.
PRABHA
Did you lose your umbrella again?
ANU (O.S.)
uh huh!
Prabha continues to cook while in the distance, through the door, Anu is seen
wiping herself.
PRABHA
You left so early...what happened?
ANU
(lying)
Nothing happened... I went all the way to pay
the electricity bill and just as my turn came,
the lady closed the counter! To top that, it
started pouring!!
Anu disappears behind the cupboard.
20.
21.
PRABHA
Oh I didn’t know they had the office open so
late!
ANU (O.S.)
I will try another day...
After a few moments, Anu emerges from the room, having changed into a
flimsy white nightie. She ties her wet hair with a towel and walks to the
kitchen table. She picks up Koshu and carries her like a baby.
ANU (CONT’D)
(changing the subject)
She is getting so big!
PRABHA
I found her loitering in the corridor outside
Kulkarni’s flat
Anu frowns and turns to Koshu in her arms. Anu sits down and puts the cat on
her lap, turning her upside down.
ANU
I asked Doctor Manoj if he will have a look at
her...
Anu touches Koshu’s pregnant belly, her red nails shine against the cats black
hair.
PRABHA
What did he say? We shouldn’t bother him
with such things.
ANU
Don’t worry, he will do it...he is a nice guy.
Prabha nods, a slight smile on her face.
Outside, the thunder crackles in the sky. The soft radio continues.
RADIO
And the monsoon is going to hit the city with
a cyclone bringing in strong winds from the
Arabian Sea.. Expect heavy rain...
(fade)
21.
22.
The doorbell buzzes
Prabha turns to Anu and they exchange a puzzled glance.
It rings again.
Anu puts Koshu down and opens the front door.
MRS KULKARNI (O.S.)
(in a meek voice)
This is for you. It came in the afternoon. you
were at work so I took it. It is so big. What is
in it?
ANU
I don’t know Aunty.
Anu holds a large box, standing at the door as Mrs Kulkarni, a scrawny middle
aged lady also holds on to it. Anu looks down at the box in her hand. Prabha
joins her at the front door...
PRABHA
What is it?
Mrs Kulkarni stares at the box, curious, not letting go of it.
MRS KULKARNI
(muttering)
Such a big box... so nice...
ANU
Mrs Kulkarni...
Anu stares Mrs Kulkarni down and finally Mrs Kulkarni reluctantly lets go of the
box. She drops her arms. She walks back to her apartment but keeps glancing
at the box.
PRABHA
Is it from your mother?
Anu shrugs. She examines the box, noticing a name.
ANU
Prabha, it is for you!
22.
23.
PRABHA
Eh? For me?
She takes the box and looks at it, she reads the label.
PRABHA (CONT’D)
Smt. Prabha Ponappa. You are right...
(turning it around)
Who sent it?
Anu also examines the box.
ANU
(looking under it)
Doesn’t say...
INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT18 18
A red rice cooker sits pretty on the floral formica dining table - an elegant
piece of equipment, in a deep ruby red with two golden swans. The cardboard
box lies at the back with some bubble wrap on the table.
For a while, neither speaks.
ANU (O.S.)
It is beautiful, isn’t it?
Prabha and Anu stare at the red rice cooker.
ANU (CONT’D)
I am sure whatever we make in this will be
very good.
Anu touches the shiny surface with her painted red fingernails.
ANU (CONT’D)
We used to have a rice cooker at home... but
not like this...this one is really international.
(turning to Prabha)
Looks expensive, no?
PRABHA
(troubled)
Who would have sent this?
23.
24.
Anu picks it up and turns it in her hands, looking for a label.
ANU
Sorry...There is nothing written.
Anu turns it around and looks at the bottom of the cooker.
ANU (CONT’D)
(reading the label in German)
D-I-c-h-t-u-n-g....the label is some foreign
language.
A flash of recognition on Prabha's face. Distressed, she takes a step back, with
a look of worry.
Oblivious to Prabha’s reaction, Anu’s eyes widen with recognition.
ANU (CONT’D)
Prabha! Doesn’t your husband live there?
Prabha has picked up the plastic from the wrapping and is vigorously making it
into a large ball.
Anu looks up, concerned. She watches Prabha helplessly re-fold the plastic.
INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT19 19
Prabha and Anu eat dinner silently. Anu looks once at the rice cooker sitting on
the table top, as if it is a third person who has joined them for dinner!
Prabha briefly glances at it.
ANU
Maybe your husband got a bonus or
something... that is why he has sent it...?
No response from Prabha.
ANU (CONT’D)
Or maybe he misses you! It is quite romantic-
PRABHA
(cutting her short)
There must be some mistake
24.
25.
Silent beat.
PRABHA (CONT’D)
We should not use it...
Anu looks awkwardly at Prabha, not knowing what to say.
INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT20 20
Prabha lies in bed. She stares at the ceiling. Her face is dimly lit by the light
from the window above her. The floral pattern of the mosquito net which hangs
above her seems imprinted on her skin.
She remains like this for some time, unable to sleep.
The monotonous sound of the falling rain is interrupted by a soft sound of the
window banging.
Prabha turns towards the sound.
She sits up in bed. Anu is fast asleep on the bed next to hers.
INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT21 21
A circular beam of light moves through the kitchen. Prabha stops at the kitchen
window. Once again, it has come undone. The curtain flutters in the wind.
Partially hidden behind the curtain sits the red rice cooker. The torch goes off.
Hold on the window
Prabha turns off the torch and walks to the window. She closes it. For a brief
moment, she observes the buildings on the other side of the road.
In one window, a woman puts her baby to sleep, while in another, a girl talks on
her phone. In a third, a shirtless old man stands alone, smoking a cigarette
watching the rain.
INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT22 22
Sitting on a chair in the dark of her kitchen, Prabha goes through her purse. She
pulls out Dr. Manoj’s poem book.
25.
26.
DOCTOR MANOJ (V.O.)
(gentle and sad)
My dreams are made of everyday things,
Small and scattered that I left behind,
My hope is just another casket of things,
I carry with me wherever I go,
and now,
You are here like a burning lamp,
In a neighbour’s house,
Whose glow I watch to keep me warm at
night.
EXT. HOSPITAL, CORRIDORS - NIGHT23 23
There is constant rain. Lightning strikes but not threatening.
The HALF GHOST of Kaki’s husband smokes in the hospital corridor. He is a man
in his 60s, dressed in a suit, and with a thin, pencil moustache. He has a
ghostly-translucent feel. And only his torso hovers in the corridor. He takes
another drag of his cigarette.
The ghost slowly fades away. The empty corridor of the hospital looks forlorn
CUT TO:
Kaki sleeps soundly.
INT. HOSPITAL, ELEVATOR- DAY24 24
Prabha is in the elevator with three guys in PPE suits.
Elevator music plays.
When the lift stops, Dr. Manoj enters. He spots Prabha and nods. Separated by
the men in the PPE suits, Dr. Manoj glances at her but is silent. The elevator
stops again and the men leave, Prabha and Dr. Manoj are now alone. The door
shuts.
Momentary silence, filled with the elevator music.
Dr. Manoj looks at Prabha, gathering the courage to talk
26.
27.
DR. MANOJ
Nurse... I wanted to ask you if - you managed
to glance at my poem?
PRABHA
Oh.. I am sorry I have not had the time Doctor
DR. MANOJ
(visibly disappointed)
Oh... ok... sure...I understand
INT. KAKI’S ROOM - DAY25 25
Dr. Supriya presses the stethoscope on Kaki’s chest. Kaki looks pensive, her
shoulders droop as the hospital gown has slipped off.
KAKI
Doctor...He came again last night. He says he
wants to go hunting...like the old days..
Dr. Supriya turns to Prabha. She is standing behind Kaki.
DR. SUPRIYA
She does not look good at all.
(taking off the stethoscope)
Nurse, get the blood pressure machine.
Prabha does not move. She stares absently, lost in thought.
DR. SUPRIYA (CONT’D)
Prabha! The blood pressure machine, please!
Prabha is jolted back to reality. She rushes to the table and gets a box, handing
it to the doctor
KAKI
(softly)
Is the age for hunting?
Dr. Supriya looks at what is in her hand. She turns back to Prabha
DR. SUPRIYA
Nurse Prabha, if I wanted a nebuliser, I would
have asked for one wouldn’t I?
27.
28.
Prabha realises she has made a mistake. Embarrassed, she looks at the
nebuliser she has just handed to Dr. Supriya.
PRABHA
Sorry doctor
Prabha quickly takes back the nebuliser and returns with the blood pressure
machine.
DR. SUPRIYA
(sternly)
Looks like you too have your head in the
clouds today!
INT. HOSPITAL CHANGING AREA - DAY26 26
Many trainee nurses are getting dressed in a small changing room. They are
putting on their green surgical uniforms and caps. Nurse 1 helps Nurse 2 tie her
mask. On the wall behind them, text messages between Anu and Shiaz appear.
SHIAZ
Whats up?
ANU
Same ol
SHIAZ
I am thinking of U...wen do I C U
ANU
Same time :) But we better not get late
today. Prabha is getting suspicious
Anu looks at her phone as a Young Nurse is washing her hands in the sink. Anu
looks up and sees Young Nurse looking at her in the glass mirror above the sink.
They exchange a glance.
INT. HOSPITAL, STORAGE ROOM - DAY27 27
The storage room is lined with many bell jars filled with formaldehyde and
nursing supplies. Anu enters.
ANU
Prabha, everyone is ready.
28.
29.
Prabha is bending over a metal tray. She looks up and nods, turning back to the
table. Nurse Shanet (30s), a chubby nurse leans on the counter, keenly
watching Anu leave.
SHANET
(cautiously)
Have you noticed anything about your new
roommate?
Preoccupied, Prabha shakes her head.
NURSE SHANET
(warming up)
All the girls are talking about her..
Prabha looks up.
SHANET
She has a boyfriend... and he is... he is...
(hesitant for effect)
How to say it?
(whispering)
‘M’!
PRABHA
(takes a breath, whispering)
Muslim???
Nurse Shanet nods deliberately.
Prabha thinks about this for a moment.
PRABHA (CONT’D)
No...can’t be. Shanet, she is a good girl.
SHANET
(matter of fact)
All the girls are talking about it.
Prabha turns firmly to Nurse Shanet.
PRABHA
Hospital is not a place for idle gossip. You are
a senior nurse.
29.
30.
INT. DELIVERY ROOM - DAY28 28
Nurse Shanet lies uncomfortably on the maroon hospital bed. She has her legs
up in a birthing posture. Prabha holds up a pair of forceps and a plastic baby in
her gloved hands, looking down at Nurse Shanet’s spread legs. Seven - eight
nurses, including Young Nurse and Anu, are huddled together watching the
demonstration.
PRABHA
Umbilical scissor
Prabha shows it to the trainee nurses and passes it on to them. They look at it
carefully, passing it around. She picks up another instrument.
PRABHA (CONT’D)
What is this?
The nurses mumble together.
NURSES
Vaginal forceps.
Prabha nods. Nurse Shanet puts down her legs and stretches. Prabha leans over
and takes out a metal box, opening it.
PRABHA
Girls, this is the placenta. You have to get
used to the smell.
The placenta is passed from one to the other. The stench is clearly awful and
the nurses hold their breath. When it reaches Anu, she holds back, trying hard
not to react. Prabha glances at Anu.
INT. STORAGE ROOM - LATER29 29
Prabha is in the storage room, putting away the tools from the demonstration.
The plastic baby used earlier is lying on the table next to her. She picks it up
and looks at it. She touches its chubby plastic cheeks. She holds it briefly.
INT. STAFFROOM - DAY30 30
Prabha sits at a table in the staffroom, a tea cup next to her. Sitting across her
is Parvaty, wearing a pink hairnet, watches her with concern.
30.
31.
PARVATY
A rice cooker?
Prabha nods.
PARVATY (CONT’D)
Why would he send you that?
Prabha shrugs.
PARVATY (CONT’D)
Are you sure it was your husband who sent it?
PRABHA
The box...it said it was from Germany. Who
else could it be?
Parvaty agrees. She shoves her hand into her blouse and takes out her herbal
medicine packet. She chews it.
PARVATY
But when did he speak to you last?
Prabha thinks for a while before answering.
PRABHA
Maybe... last year... or I think a little bit
more. He called to wish me for Onam.
Parvaty gets up and goes to the stove where she is cooking a large pot of
lentils. She stirs the cauldron of yellow liquid.
PARVATY
You know Nurse, when people live abroad for
a long time, they can lose their mind or
memory. It happens like that.
Parvaty turns to Prabha.
PARVATY (CONT’D)
What are you going to do?
Prabha shrugs.
PRABHA
What should I do?
31.
32.
PARVATY
Call him up and give him a piece of your
mind!
Prabha gives this a thought.
PRABHA
(hesitant)
Call him?
Prabha looks confused. She gets up abruptly and goes to the window.
PRABHA (CONT’D)
He is very busy there... He works very hard
PARVATY
You work hard too isn't it?
Parvaty stirs the lentils again.
PARVATY (CONT’D)
Here taste it for the salt
Prabha worried, does not respond. Parvaty gives a ladle with lentil for to taste.
Prabha nods to say its fine. She looks back to the window.
Outside on the construction site, the working men are moving up and down the
huge building. Prabha watches.
Parvaty continues to mutter at the back
PARVATY (CONT’D)
If I meet that husband of yours... Im gonna
box his ears, isn't it?
PRABHA
(changing the subject)
Did the builders come again?
Parvaty shakes her head.
PARVATY
No... but they cut off the electricity, isn't it!
Prabha turns, concerned.
32.
33.
PRABHA
Why didn't you tell me!?
Parvaty is silent.
INT. BUS - EVENING31 31
Traveling through the city in the bus, Prabha and Parvaty sit silently. Parvaty
holds a pink file in her hands. The landscape of the city changes as the bus
enters a very posh area of Mumbai.
INT. LAWYER’S HOUSE - EVENING32 32
ADVOCATE DESAI (60s) looks through some documents in his apartment in a
upper class Dadar neighbourhood. He has reading glasses perched on his nose.
The house is brightly lit with large, abstract paintings that look like a cheap
copies of Jackson pollock. His wife MRS DESAI, walks around in the back,
looking busy with a MAID.
ADVOCATE DESAI
Supriya told me you have lived in your place
for 22 years...it’s a real shame.
Prabha and Parvaty are sitting across the table from him. Cups of tea and
snacks lay in front of them. Parvaty nods.
ADVOCATE DESAI (CONT’D)
Are there others who are in the same
situation, or is it just you?
Parvaty looks nervous and she turns to Prabha.
PRABHA
Sir, most others have received compensatory
flats...whoever had papers.
ADVOCATE DESAI
Hmm
PARVATY
(mustering the courage to speak)
Sir, my husband got the place as compensation
from the government after the mills shut
down.
33.
34.
ADVOCATE
Then there must be papers somewhere!
Parvaty shakes her head.
PARVATY
Sir, he never told me where he put them...and
.. I can’t ask a dead man, isn’t it?
PRABHA
Sir, isn’t there something you can do for her?
The advocate is lost in though.He keeps looking at the papers in his hands
ADVOCATE DESAI
The problem is... you don’t really have a
case. There is no proof that you have lived
here, Parvaty...
PARVATY
But you can ask my neighbours...
ADVOCATE DESAI
That won’t hold up in court, Parvaty....If you
can find any proof...? Something with your
name on it?
Prabha turns to Parvaty but Parvaty does not know what to say.
INT. PARVATY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT33 33
Parvaty lights a candle. She has already lit a few more and placed them
around. It is a very small shanty room pilled with many useless things that
Parvaty has hoarded over the years - old saris, pots and pans.
PARVATY
They do everything to chase you out, these
rascals.
Prabha looks through the documents that Parvaty has kept in front of her. She
examines them.
PRABHA
These are all receipts and medical papers of
your husband....
34.
35.
She looks through them again. She finds a passport photo of a young man. He is
dressed in a t-shirt.
PARVATY (O.S.)
That’s Suresh...my son.
The flickering light of the flame shines on the young man’s face. Prabha looks
back at Parvaty in the darkness. The candle now flickers in her eyes. She looks
tired and vulnerable for the first time.
PARVATY (CONT’D)
Good for nothing lout...drunkard, like his
father, isn’t it?
(swears in Marathi)
Its good you don’t have kids, nurse... they are
more of a burden than any help.
Prabha puts the photo away. She looks a bit sad at Parvaty's words.
PARVATY (CONT’D)
Sorry... I didn't mean it like that.
Prabha nods.
That is when the light also comes back on. Both Prabha and Parvaty look around
and squint in the new bright light. But the light quickly goes off again.
PARVATY (CONT’D)
Well.
EXT. ROAD OUTSIDE HOSPITAL - NIGHT34 34
Anu walks out of the hospital with Young Nurse. The rain has stopped but the
area outside the hospital is still wet and reflects the streetlights.
ANU
Go ahead... I have to go to the market.
Young Nurse nods and leaves in one direction
YOUNG NURSE
See you tomorrow Anu
Anu nods and waits for a few moments before walking off in the opposite
direction.
35.
36.
She walks along the hospital building and to the left is the train track. The road
is pretty isolated. A YOUNG MAN emerges from the alley way and starts walking
behind Anu. She glances at him and walks faster. He follows. She looks nervous.
They turn the corner, the hospital out of sight, Anu and the Young Man now
hold hands.
INT. TRAIN - NIGHT35 35
Anu and the YOUNG MAN travel in a bus together. He is Shiaz. He is a handsome
Malayali man, with curly black hair. He wears a small silver earring. He wears a
formal stripped shirt.
ANU
Sorry it got late
SHIAZ
Its ok... I don’t mind waiting...
ANU
Were you bored?
Shiaz shakes his head. He takes out a wooden duck and hands it to Anu
SHIAZ
There was an order for 50 of these today... I
took one for you
She holds the little toy in her palm.
SHIAZ (CONT’D)
I know you had that pet duck as a kid!
Anu looks delighted! She grins and admires the wooden toy. She winds the key
and the duck moves forward with a mechanical sound. She places it on the seat
and they both watch it move.
ANU
Won’t your boss mind... that you took one?
SHIAZ
I don’t care what he thinks...he is really
getting on my nerves!
Anu lofts the duck and puts it away.
36.
37.
SHIAZ (CONT’D)
He got some 4 likes on tiktok and now he
wants to put up new songs every week. That
fucker... he saw my t shirt and forced me to
swap with him. He said it was more ‘youtube
appropriate’ Then when I asked him for it
back he started abusing me... !
ANU
Well..you do have nice clothes.. He must be
jealous of you!
EXT. MARKET - NIGHT36 36
A market with a row of shops having fake brand t-shirts. the shops are covered
in blue plastic tarpaulin sheets as rain protection. The sky is also illuminated
with the same blue colour.
Anu looks through the many clothes on the rack of a roadside shop. She takes
out different t-shirts, examines them and keeps them back. A potbellied, young
shopkeeper watches her keenly. Finally she selects a blue tie- dye T shirt with a
large print of a tiger’s face. She holds it up against Shiaz.. She examines it
again.
SHOPKEEPER
Fixed price. 500.
Anu rolls her eyes and reluctantly puts it back on the rack.
EXT. STREET MARKET- NIGHT37 37
They walk in the market, meandering through the crowd. The sounds of street
hawkers waft in and out as a cool breeze.
ANU (V.O.)
Feels like I have not seen you in many days.
There are moving LED lights in the shape of Ganesh God, twinkling in
multicolours.
SHIAZ (V.O.)
You see me now..
37.
38.
ANU (V.O.)
If you don’t see someone for a long time,
would you forget their face?
SHIAZ (V.O.)
What is the matter?
Halogen bulbs illuminate glass-covered displays of samosas and confectionery.
EXT. MARKET - NIGHT38 38
On a black screen a series of still photographs appear.
First is a YOUNG MAN wearing a checked office shirt and glasses.
Anu giggles.
Another photo appears. This time a TRADITIONAL MAN with a holy white dot on
his forehead worn by very religious people.
A third photograph, a MAN with a cap and a handlebar moustache.
SHIAZ (O.S.)
(in a fake deep voice)
I have a farm and two elephants and I go
hunting for pigeons in my free time.
The picture changes to a BALD MAN who looks much older than Anu.
SHIAZ (O.S.) (CONT’D)
(changing his voice to a meek
one)
Oh.. Yes...myself... MSC Physics. I expect a
Bajaj scooter and two cows for dowry!
ANU (O.S.)
(imitating her father’s voice)
No no. I can only give a microwave and one
cow only!
SHIAZ (O.S.)
(same voice)
Marrying your daughter for so cheap? No way!
38.
39.
Anu laughs.
The picture changes to a HANDSOME MAN with a polo t-shirt.
ANU (O.S.)
This guy is handsome!
SHIAZ (O.S.)
Very handsome.
(pause)
If I make a fake profile on this marriage site...
and change my name to some Hindu fellow...
your father might send you my photo...?
Shiaz’s photo appears wearing the tie- dye t shirt they didn't buy earlier. Many
pictures of Shiaz appear in different poses.
ANU (O.S.)
What would be your fake name?
SHIAZ
Let’s say ‘Ajayan’!
ANU (O.S.)
(teasing)
Even if he did... I will reject them.
EXT. MARKET - NIGHT39 39
Anu and Shiaz are sitting at small roadside shack sharing a rose coloured ice
cream. They are both looking at her phone, swiping through images. Behind
them, a man is preparing elaborate ice cream sundaes.
SHIAZ
You are very hard to please!
EXT. PARK - NIGHT40 40
Anu and Shiaz kiss passionately behind a tree. They are in the dark, sitting in a
park where a cricket match is taking place. Occasionally, their kiss is
punctuated by the sound of a ball being hit by a bat.
ANU
I feel your heartbeat.
39.
40.
SHIAZ
It is beating very fast...
Anu nods.
ANU
Can you feel mine?
SHIAZ
Yea....
Behind them a young player goes to retrieve a lost ball. He does not notice
them.
INT. APARTMENT, KITCHEN - NIGHT41 41
It is raining heavily outside the window. The kitchen window in the apartment
has once again come undone. Rain water has wet the kitchen counter and
made a small puddle on the floor. Prabha pulls the window shut, trying hard to
put on the small lever. She manages to close it. She looks at the window.
Prabha is perched on the kitchen counter. With a hammer in her hand, she
bangs the window to realign it. Water from the window makes her drenched.
Partly soaked, Prabha now attempts to tie the window with a large cloth. She
has a hard time closing it.
INT. APARTMENT, KITCHEN - NIGHT42 42
The window is covered with a large floral cloth. Wet from the rain, Prabha
stands in the middle of her wet kitchen, watching it.
INT. APARTMENT, BEDROOM - NIGHT43 43
Exhausted, Prabha heads to her bed. She sits down. Slowly, she lets her body
fall onto it. She gazes up at the ceiling.
Behind her, through the window, it is still pouring rain. Lightning regularly splits
the sky. Prabha lays there like that for some time.
She closes her eyes.
An image of Dr. Manoj running his hands through his hair appears.
40.
41.
She opens her eyes. She lays still.
EXT. STREET- NIGHT44 44
The rain comes down heavily.
The entire cricket team from the park dressed in white uniforms is huddled
under a bus stop. Under the same bus stop Anu and Shiaz also take refuge. For
a long time they watch the rain, not knowing what to do.
ANU
It’s not fair!
Shiaz chuckles but notices that Anu looks pissed
SHIAZ
Its ok... cheer up...
Anu notices something in the distance. Her expression changes.
ANU
Shiaz look there!
There is a sign for ‘Sri Krishna Hotel’ in the distance across the road.
ANU (O.S.) (CONT’D)
Should we go?
SHIAZ (O.S.)
I don't have enough cash
ANU (O.S.)
I got some...
Shiaz turns to Anu, slightly concerned.
SHIAZ
Uh... Anu... maybe its not a good idea..
(hesitant)
They won’t allow us if they find out.
ANU
If they find out.
41.
42.
INT. HOTEL - NIGHT45 45
A middle-aged, bald MANAGER is completely engrossed in the cricket match on
TV, while also fanning himself with an electric fan.
ANU (O.S.)
We would like a room for two.
MANAGER
(not looking)
Pittu ... get the key and register.
PITTU, the bellboy gets up, a sour expression on his face. He hands the register
to the Manager. The Manager starts looking through the registry.
ANU (O.S.)
We are here for our honeymoon you see, and
our train got very late so...
MANAGER
(cutting her short, not interested)
Name?
ANU
Mr and Mrs Aadat.
MANAGER
(looking up)
Anupama Aadat?
Anu is surprised that he knows her name.
MANAGER (CONT’D)
It's on your name tag.
She looks at the name tag.
ANU
Right.
MANAGER
Husband's name?
ANU
Umm.. Ajayan (Hindu name) Aadat
42.
43.
The Manager finishes filling up the form and hands her the key.
MANAGER
Pittu will show you the room. That will be 500
rupees.
Anu smiles gleefully. She takes out a small purse and counts the money. She has
some hidden money in her blouse too. She rummages and takes that out,
adding to the pile of notes.
Pittu get up lazily and indicates they should follow him.
MANAGER (O.S.) (CONT’D)
(counting the money)
I need to take a copy of your IDs.
Anu’s smile vanishes.
She looks through her bag and takes out her ID and hands it to him. He looks at
it and then looks at Shiaz. He raises his eyebrows.
ANU
Umm... he forgot his wallet. Mine should be
enough, isn’t it?
MANAGER
I need his too.. Government rules.
ANU
Can’t you make an exception? It is our
honeymoon after all?
The Manager looks at both of them, evaluating the situation. Then he shrugs his
shoulders. He indicates to Pittu to put away the key and Anu follows him with
her eyes, totally helpless.
MANAGER
No miss...can’t take a chance...Now days you
can’t tell who is a terrorist...People dress
normally... but then turn out to be
terrorists... who can tell anything any more?
43.
44.
EXT. STREET - NIGHT46 46
Neon lights make colourful patterns on the wet tar road. Sitting on a staircase
of a public library, Shiaz smokes a beedi (cheap cigarette).
SHIAZ
This place is shit.
Anu nods.
INT. HOSPITAL, SONOGRAPHY ROOM - DAY47 47
Koshu, the pregnant cat, is laid on a pink towel. Anu’s hands with pink finger
nails, carefully shave the cat’s belly.
ANU (O.S.)
Hold her legs
Prabha’s hands carefully hold the cat’s legs, allowing Anu to shave further
down. Now there is a perfect bald rectangle on the cat’s stomach.
DOCTOR MANOJ (O.S.)
Ready?
CUT TO:
The sonography monitor shows the inside of the cat’s belly in black and white.
Slowly, images of the babies inside start to appear.
DOCTOR MANOJ (O.S.) (CONT’D)
One... two... three...
ANU
Four heartbeats!
Dr. Manoj is holding the cat down with the sonography machine. All three of
them stand there for a moment looking down at Koshu. Anu touches Koshu’s
head and face, the cat licks her finger. Dr. Manoj looks hesitant to touch her.
He reaches out tentatively. He doesn't touch her.
ANU (CONT’D)
She doesn’t bite.
44.
45.
Dr. Manoj touches Koshu reluctantly and then realises that it is quite nice. He
smiles as if he has achieved something. He looks up for Prabha’s approval but
gets none. Koshu jerks her head and Dr. Manoj quickly withdraws his hands.
ANU (O.S.) (CONT’D)
They say that people who are afraid of cats
have a chance of being an animal in their past
life...
Prabha glances at Anu
ANU (CONT’D)
Do you want to touch her again?
DR. MANOJ
No... Its alright
ANU
Oh come on doctor... its easy.
She holds his palm to make him touch Koshu.
Prabha glares at Anu. Dr. Manoj looks awkward and conscious. He turns once
more to Prabha, but she still does not respond to him. A tension lingers
between them, to which Anu remains oblivious.
PRABHA
Don’t mind her doctor, she talks more than
she should.
The atmosphere is tense.
INT. CORRIDOR - DAY48 48
Anu holds the rice cooker box with Koshu inside.
Prabha and her walk in the corridor silently. They reach the elevator.
PRABHA
Why did you have to talk like
that?
ANU
Talk like what?
45.
46.
PRABHA
(angrily)
The way you did! To doctor Manoj... you can’t
do that! You can’t do whatever you want! If
you behave like a slut, people will never give
you any respect! Everyone is talking about
you!
Prabha grabs the box from Anu and carries it away.
Anu is left by the elevator, not knowing what she did wrong. The door opens
and shuts.
INT. TRAIN - EVENING49 49
Anu and Shiaz travel in the train.
ANU
She is getting on my nerves.
SHIAZ
Maybe she is frustrated.
ANU
Why is taking it out on me? She snapped at me
today, totally out of the blue!
SHIAZ
Forget about all that... I have some news that
will cheer you up!
ANU
Nothing can cheer me up....
SHIAZ
Fine! Then I won’t tell you.
Anu turns to Shiaz, nudging him.
ANU
Tell me!
Shiaz shakes his head.
46.
47.
ANU (CONT’D)
Please tell me!
Shiaz shrugs, playing hard to get
ANU (CONT’D)
Come on!
She pinches him playfully.
SHIAZ
Ok ok! So.... Do you have a burqa?
ANU
Why would I have a burqa, Shiaz!
SHIAZ
Well... you will need a burqa if we need to be
successful at our plan.
ANU
What is it?
SHIAZ
Aunty and Uncle are going to a wedding
tomorrow night.
Anu frowns, confused.
SHIAZ (CONT’D)
No need to scrunch up your pretty face,
detective.
Anu’s expression becomes one of recognition.
ANU
So your place will be free!?
Shiaz shakes his head deliberately.
Anu squeals with excitement. All the passengers look at her.
SHIAZ
(to the passenger)
Sorry sorry... my wife just realised she is
pregnant.
47.
48.
All the passengers smile and congratulate them. Anu sits back down and laughs
happily.
OLD LADY
You two make a very good couple
Shiaz nods.
SHIAZ
We know... everyone tells us that.
Anu looks at Shiaz, unbelieving.
SHIAZ (CONT’D)
(to Anu)
You have not seen my neighbourhood! If they
see you sneaking into my place... in this
uniform... people are going to talk. Its very
conservative!
Anu nods and grins
ANU
I will find a burqa... don't worry...
EXT. APARTMENT COMPLEX - NIGHT50 50
Holding her bag on her head, Anu runs into her apartment building.
INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT51 51
Anu opens the front door. She sees Prabha sitting by herself at the table.
Prabha turns to look at Anu. She clearly wants to say something. But Anu does
not want to engage. She is in a very good mood and she does not want Prabha
to spoil it.
Anu rushes into the bedroom.
Prabha is left, staring at her.
INT. APARTMENT, BEDROOM - NIGHT52 52
Anu takes off her sari and lets it slip on the floor. She takes off her blouse too.
48.
49.
Prabha enters the room behind her.
She looks at Anu’s back.
Anu realises Prabha has entered the room. She takes off all her clothes. She
glances to the back to see if her nudity has embarrassed Prabha, as she
intended. Prabha looks at Anu’s naked body and turns away awkwardly. She
faces the wall, unable to look at her, summoning the courage to speak.
PRABHA
Anu... Are you hungry?
Anu wipes her hair.
PRABHA (CONT’D)
(desperate, still facing away)
I..I.. prepared your favourite dish...
Anu slips on her white nightie.
PRABHA (CONT’D)
Coconut fish curry.
Anu ties her hair in her towel and turns to look at Prabha who still awkwardly
faces the wall.
PRABHA (CONT’D)
Listen... I don’t know what came over me
today... I don’t know why I said all that. I... I
am sorry Anu...
Wiping her hair, Anu looks at Prabha who looks defeated and vulnerable.
INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT53 53
Anu and Prabha eat dinner together. Anu looks up at Prabha with a half-smile,
enjoying the curry that Prabha has prepared.
ANU
It is very good...
Prabha looks satisfied.
49.
50.
INT. APARTMENT, - NIGHT54 54
Prabha’s uniform Sari is hung out in the kitchen. A small rotating fan is kept
near it to dry it. The fan turns its face left and right and makes the sari move.
The shadows of the rain leaves streaks across the apartment, as if it is
submerged in water.
Prabha and Anu lie in bed, cocooned in their floral mosquito nets.The window
above them has the city lights against the sky. The dull hum of the fan and the
rain create a dream - like feel.
ANU
Prabha? Did you know him from before?
PRABHA
Who?
ANU
Your husband?
Prabha does not answer immediately.
PRABHA
(sigh)
No. Not at all.
One day my father called me and said, come
home. When I got there, they had already
fixed my marriage. That’s the way it went.
ANU
You didn’t try to find out about him?
PRABHA
I did. I tried to meet him.
ANU
It must have been romantic!
PRABHA
No. Not romantic. I got scared and did not end
up going.
Anu laughs a little.
ANU
Did you find him handsome?
50.
51.
PRABHA
I thought he was... Good looking.
They are both silent for some time.
Koshu wanders into the room and walks into the open cupboard, tumbling down
freshly kept clothes.
The sound of her bell around her neck.
ANU (O.S.)
Prabha, are you asleep?
PRABHA (O.S.)
No.
ANU (O.S.)
Can I ask you something else?
PRABHA (O.S.)
Go on...
ANU (O.S.)
How can you marry a stranger? I don’t think I
could do it.
PRABHA (O.S.)
You might think you know someone but they
can also become strangers...
ANU (O.S.)
How is that?
PRABHA (O.S.)
They can go away and come back as
different people maybe... Or simply change
over time. And then they are as good as
strangers. No?
The window above the bed is open and bangs softly in the wind. Prabha sits up
and shuts it, briefly watching the night rain. Outside, the framed sky is covered
in purple clouds. A small light of an airplane moves between the clouds. Prabha
exits.
51.
52.
A simple line drawings appear on this image...as if doodled - of a child-like
figure of a woman sitting naked in front of a fully clothed man who looks the
least bit interested in her as he reads a book.
The window rattles a bit more.
The drawing disappears.
PRABHA (O.S.) (CONT’D)
Anu are you asleep?
ANU (O.S.)
Yes, but you can go on...
The sound has a transcendental quality...becoming increasingly dream-like.
PRABHA (O.S.)
After the marriage...he left soon... to
Germany. Once he was gone, I hardly heard
from him again. We spoke a few times... But
it became difficult, to talk.
(pause)
Maybe we didn’t have anything left to say any
more.
Another drawing appears. This time, a half naked woman holds a oversized
lotus, but its centre looks like innards. A long silence follows. Anu breaks it.
ANU (O.S)
(whisper)
Do you miss him?
PRABHA (O.S.)
(whisper)
I don’t know. Can you miss someone you don’t
even know?
Prabha looks up at the ceiling.
PRABHA (CONT’D)
(whispering, almost to herself.)
I try to imagine his life in this far away
country. Everything must be different there. I
think of him in this large warehouse. It all
seems so faraway.
52.
53.
INT. HOSPITAL, STAFFROOM - DAY55 55
Parvaty looks out of the window.
PARVATY
What a dismal day.
Sitting on the stool, Prabha has covered her face with her palms. Parvaty
approaches her with a concerned look. Prabha uncovers her face.
PARVATY (CONT’D)
You don’t look well.
PRABHA
I have not been able to sleep.
PARVATY
(nodding)
I have something for that...
From a shelf, Parvaty takes out a glass. She rummages inside her sari blouse
and from it appears a small newspaper packet. Parvaty unfurls it and pours
some powder into the glass. She pours water into it. As she stirs it, the water
turns crimson.
PARVATY (CONT’D)
Nurse, I have some news....I am moving back
to my village.
Prabha looks up at Parvaty
PARVATY (CONT’D)
There is nothing more I can do...isn’t it?
PRABHA
What ? Of course there is Parvaty..We can still-
--
PARVATY
I already spoke to Dr. Supriya.. and she found
me a job there.
PRABHA
At a hospital?
53.
54.
PARVATY
No... there are some rich people who have
built bungalow near by... they need a cook.
PRABHA
But-
PARVATY
At least no one can throw me out.
Parvaty shakes her head. She looks out at the construction site
PARVATY (CONT’D)
You see that building there... it is the same
builders...They are building everywhere
nurse... building their tall towers that reach
up to the sky... they think they have replaced
god.
The construction site has many people walking around.
Prabha looks worried.
PRBAHA
How will you manage there?
PARVATY
These knees are still strong nurse... I will
manage!
She brings the glass to Prabha and sits down next to her on the stool. She
places the crimson drink on the table between them. Prabha looks down,
seeming defeated.
PARVATY (CONT’D)
Nurse, drink this.
(handing her the drink)
It will make you feel better.
Prabha takes the glass reluctantly.
Parvaty gets up and goes back to the table. She drops some more powder into a
glass, and pours water into it. Behind her, Prabha looks down at the glass in her
hand and takes a sip. She cringes at the taste.
54.
55.
PARVATY (CONT’D)
It can happen sometimes...
INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY56 56
Dr. Manoj walks in the corridor, looking around for someone.
PARVATY (V.O.)
...That the head and the heart get out of
alignment.
Dr. Manoj opens a door to a room which is dark, turns on the light, sees no one.
He turns off the light and exits.
PARVATY (V.O.)
Then you cannot use your Western medicine...
because they don’t have a cure for it...
Dr. Manoj walks in the corridor again, looking into another room.
PARVATY (V.O.)
Or even the words to say what is the illness
from which you suffer.
INT. STAFF ROOM - DAY57 57
PARVATY
Isn’t that how you feel?
Prabha is still sitting at the table. Parvaty faces away from her, mixing the
same red drink in another glass for herself. Prabha notices Dr. Manoj and in a
smooth motion, slinks under the table and hides. Dr. Manoj enters the
staffroom and looks around.
DR. MANOJ
Nurse Prabha?
Parvaty turns and looks at Dr. Manoj awkwardly. She scratches her head and
turns to where Prabha was seated but cannot see Prabha who is crouching
below. Parvaty looks at the red drink in her hand.
PARVATY
(mumbles in Marathi)
Wow...This stuff is strong...
55.
56.
EXT. MARKET - EVENING58 58
A pink neon light of a brightly lit burqa shop sparkles across the street. Several
mannequins wearing stylish burqa stand in different postures outside. Anu can
be seen through the glass.
INT. STATION BATHROOM - EVENING59 59
In a dingy bathroom of the station. Anu is already dressed in a black burqa. She
is looking in the mirror, trying to fix the veil. Only her kohl laden eyes are now
visible.
INT. METRO - EVENING60 60
Wearing the burqa, Anu travels in the metro, leaning against the door through
which the city can be seen. The windows are covered in streaks of water.
Text messages appear in yellow:
SHIAZ
Hey... have U left?
ANU
Yea
SHIAZ
U can’t come here!
SHIAZ (CONT’D)
I am sorry!!
SHIAZ (CONT’D)
Everyone came back early..Nikah cancelled....
the Harbour Metro Line is flooded... :( Dnt b
mad.
Her shoulders droop with disappointment
INT. METRO STATION - NIGHT61 61
Standing on the platform, Anu struggles to take off her burqa. She pulls it off
throws it into the dustbin. She pats down her dishevelled hair.
56.
57.
The metro station has only a few commuters who stare at her.
The lights from the LED train time table shine across the metal railings as Anu
walks slowly, not knowing what to do.
INT. METRO STATION - NIGHT62 62
Anu glides up the deserted escalator. She walks on to the skywalk which is lit
with red and blue lights. Anu walks near the railing. She notices some shady
guys staring at her from the end of the skywalk. She turns away and walks off.
She goes to a desolate platform and sits on the lonesome bench, waiting for
another train to take her back home
I/E. HOSPITAL FOYER. NIGHT63 63
Dr. Manoj waits outside the hospital at the same spot he had met Prabha
before. He stands under a lone tube light.
INT. APARTMENT KITCHEN - LATE NIGHT64 64
Prabha stares at the rice cooker on the dining table. There is no light in the
room, only the faint light from the street lamps outside. The rain has picked up
and lightening occasionally brightens the sky.
Prabha puts a handful of rice into the cooker. She pours in some water. The red
light of the rice cooker comes on.
INT . APARTMENT - NIGHT65 65
The rice boils in the rice cooker. Slowly, steam starts to float out, forming a
cloud.
Prabha rests her head on the table next to it. The red light from the cooker
casts a glow on her face. The steam trickles out, clouding her face.
The steam meanders through the small apartment, making its way to the
bedroom.
It floats past Prabha’s bed and floral mosquito net, hanging in the air.
57.
58.
The smoke has an unreal quality and settles like a dream on Prabha. She lies on
her bed, covered in smoke as if inside a dream
The steam escapes from the open window.
EXT. TREETOP LEVEL - NIGHT66 66
The steam leaves the window and joins the monsoon clouds outside. The thick
clouds crawl over the dark city, gradually covering the skyscrapers.
A drawing appears of a naked woman floating in the sky on a cloud.
PRABHA (V.O.)
I keep having these thoughts... that he will
come back.. And he will say he wants to live
with me... and be with me... and all this
absence was just some misunderstanding...
maybe we will start a family. That would be
nice, wouldn't it... ?
The clouds move rapidly, revealing for a brief moment, the moon. But soon it is
covered. The drawing disappears.
PRABHA (V.O.)
After all he is my husband...
Prabha holds Koshu in her hand. The steam has cleared.
PRABHA
Should I call him? What do you think, my
princess?
INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT67 67
Prabha carefully presses the buttons of a mobile phone, looking at a piece of
paper in her hand. She puts it to her ear.
The phone rings for a long time. She waits for an answer.
PRABHA
Hello? Hello?
58.
59.
AUTOMATED VOICE OF A FEMALE
Die Nummer, die Sie anrufen, ist außerhalb
der Reichweite
It is an automatic message from the German service provider. Not
understanding, she waits till the message finishes. The line goes off.
PRABHA
(feeble)
Hello?
She looks at the phone, disappointed.
She lets her head lean against the wall behind her. In the dark, everything is
motionless.
INT. CINEMA THEATRE - DAY68 68
Some twenty nurses, all in blue uniforms, sit in a movie theatre, their keenly
absorbed faces flickering with the light of the screen.
A romantic song plays in the Malayalam movie.
The camera tracks past the nurses who are engrossed in the film. It stops at
Prabha who has tears stream down her eyes. She wipes her eyes but can’t stop
the tears.
EXT. ROAD NEAR HOSPITAL - NIGHT69 69
At the construction site, some workers watch a a film off a shared mobile
phone, huddled close together inside a pink mosquito net. Their yellow helmets
hang on the wall.
A Bollywood song plays from a speaker in an outdoor Chinese restaurant set up
on the pavement. Red plastic chairs and tables are partially occupied. A cook
tosses noodles in a large wok. His assistant washes plastic plates in a tub on the
floor, throwing extra bits of food to a white dog. A waiter wearing a ‘Bob
Marley’ T shirt, leans against the wall and smokes a cigarette.
On one table, Prabha and Parvaty are seated. They are eating chicken soup.
Parvaty looks up and smiles at Prabha.
PARVATY
Its quite good, isn’t it?
59.
60.
PRABHA
I prefer your cooking.
Parvaty chuckles.
PARVATY
Good, now I won’t have any regrets.
Parvaty’s smile vanishes briefly and she eats quietly.
PARVATY (CONT’D)
If you have regrets in this life... you have to
carry them on to the next.
Parvaty looks contemplative as she sips her soup. Prabha watches her.
PARVATY (CONT’D)
You only seem to be real if you have some
papers... otherwise you could just vanish into
thin air and no one will even know....
PRABHA
We would know.... If you vanished... all of us
at the hospital. We will miss you.
Parvaty smiles.
PARVATY
You are a very good lady, Nurse.
EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - NIGHT70 70
Prabha and Parvaty look up at the large half made building
PARVATY
I am going to do it.
Prabha nods
Prabha and Parvaty look once at the large sign board that says ‘Harishchandra
Builders’. Parvaty hands a brick to Prabha. She has another brick in her hand.
Parvaty and Prabha take a big swing and hit the board. It makes a loud sound
but nothing happens. After a few moments the board begins to creak. It comes
crashing down with a thud sound!
60.
61.
All around dust flies and sounds of workers running towards them. Parvaty and
Prabha make a run for it.
EXT. ROAD OUTSIDE HOSPITAL - NIGHT71 71
Prabha and Parvaty giggle as the walk past the hospital gate. They are a little
out of breath. They make their way towards the railway station.
A voice calls out to Prabha from inside the gate.
DOCTOR MANOJ (O.S)
Nurse Prabha?
Prabha and Parvaty stop. They turn and watch as the gates open. Dr. Manoj
steps out. He holds a small blue plastic bag. He takes a few steps towards
them.
DOCTOR MANOJ (CONT’D)
Nurse Prabha... When did your shift end? I
didn’t see you around.
Parvaty looks at them and knows she needs to leave
PARVATY
Nurse, I am getting late
Prabha nods and Parvaty leaves. Dr. Manoj waits till she is gone.
Awkward silence.
DOCTOR MANOJ
I made you some Unniyappam (sweetmeat).
He hands her the blue plastic bag.
DOCTOR MANOJ (CONT’D)
Don’t open it now...
(looking at his feet)
I won’t be able to face you if it is too bad.
PRABHA
(kindly)
It will be good I am sure.
Another awkward pause.
61.
62.
DOCTOR MANOJ
My contract here will be over soon... and I am
thinking of not renewing it.
PRABHA
Oh... you too are going to be leaving us
then... Where do you plan to go?
DOCTOR MANOJ
I was thinking...somewhere close to home.
PRABHA
(hiding her disappointment)
That might be a good idea.
Dr. Manoj looks at her. He wants to say something but stops himself. He looks
around. He holds Prabha’s arm and leads her away from the busy road. She
feels embarrassed that he is touching her.
They come to the empty children’s park by the side of the road. The park has
empty swings and plastic life size figurines of wild animals. They stop between
a tiger and a penguin. He lets go of her arm. They face one another, standing
under a lone light. Prabha waits for him to speak.
DOCTOR MANOJ
(not looking at her directly)
It was nice here, in Bombay. But difficult...
And I have a problem with the language too...
PRABHA
You will pick up Hindi... It is not so hard...
DOCTOR MANOJ
I never got used to it here... Even today, after
so many months, I forgot to get off at my
train station... I reached all the way to the
end of the line....
Dr. Manoj jams his hands inside his pockets.
The old empty metal swings nearby sway and make a metallic sound.
Prabha turns to look at them. She turns back to Dr. Manoj who is watching her
intently.
62.
63.
DOCTOR MANOJ (CONT’D)
Prabha... I... before I go I wanted to ask
you... I wanted to see if... there was a
reason if... If I should continue to stay
here....If there was some reason for me to
stay back.
Prabha understands the pleading in his voice. She remains silent. She looks
away. She looks sad.
PRABHA ~
But doctor... I am married...
Prabha doesn't look up.
DR. MANOJ.
I know...but...
PRABHA
(without facing him)
I must go Doctor. I will miss my train.
Dr. Manoj looks disappointed. He watches as Prabha turns and starts to walk
away. After a few steps she stops.
PRABHA (CONT’D)
(turning around)
Where did you say... your train took you to?
Dr. Manoj looks up.
DOCTOR MANOJ
Nowhere... To the end of the line. Where the
last tip of Bombay meets the sea.
PRABHA
Is it nice?
DOCTOR MANOJ
(accepting things with a mild
smile)
Yes. It was very nice.
PRABHA
I should go... To see it then?
63.
64.
DOCTOR MANOJ
Yes... I think you will like it... Just keep
sitting on the bus and don't get off till you
reach the end of the line.
She starts walking away leaving Dr. Manoj, his hands in his pockets. All around
there is darkness.
He stands in the sole pool of light.
EXT. ROAD - NIGHT72 72
Prabha walks at a swift pace on the dark road. The street lights illuminate the
road in small circular pools of light. Prabha keeps walking, emerging from the
light and disappearing into the darkness. She does not stop, she keeps walking
till there is no longer any light, just darkness all around. She does not stop.
INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT73 73
The wet sari is hung from the ceiling, suspended over the entire room like
ocean waves.
The dull hum of the fan and the rain increases in volume and turns into the
sound of the ocean.
The camera tracks into it. The ocean-sari moves in a sensual and dreamy
manner.
BLACK
I/E. BUS - DAY74 74
A rumbling hum of the bus engine is a dull and continuous sound.
The view from a traveling bus passes over the outskirts of the city, leaving
behind the suburban shanty towns. The industrial outskirts pass by with giant
telephone towers dotting the empty fields. Slowly, the hills of the Western
Ghats appear, with their rocky cliffs and dried waterfalls.
The road flattens as it passes by sparse village houses that lay in between the
freshly sown paddy fields. Men and women in colourful clothes bend to sow the
rice, their feet submerged in water. Occasionally they look up towards the bus
as it passes them by.
64.
65.
Sitting inside the bus, Prabha looks out. It is for the first time that she is not
wearing her stiff sari uniform but a casual lavender salwar-kameez. A loose
duppata hangs over her. She opens the window, letting the cool wind touch her
face.
The sound of the rumbling bus turns into a moan of the wind.
Anu, is wearing a casual ochre yellow blouse, sitting next to Prabha in the bus.
Parvaty is on the seat across the isle from Anu. She has a large maroon canvas
bag on her lap . She looks out of the other window. A few of her bags are also
on the floor.
PARVATY
(softly)
It feels as if the distance has increased.
ANU
Is it far from here.... your village?
PARVATY
Do you see that hill?
(pause)
It is behind it.
They look out of the window.
ANU
That isn't far...
PARVATY
It may look close... but the road is long.
At the front of the bus, many men and women, wearing traditional
Maharashtrian clothes sit in a cramped space near the driver. Some of them
hold baskets with fruits and vegetables. The front windshield of the bus,
covered in a thin layer of dust, shows the road that lays ahead.
Test messages between Anu and Shiaz appear in Yellow:
SHIAZ
I wish I cd sit w U.
ANU
me 2
65.
66.
SHIAZ
I like your yellow dress!
ANU
Don’t stare at me or someone will get
suspicious.
SHIAZ
You should have thought of that before
looking so beautiful.
The bus halts. A man sitting in the middle seat of the bus gets up to get off.
When he moves away, a familiar face is seen at the back - it is Shiaz! Since
neither Parvaty nor Prabha have met him, he travels with them unnoticed. He
looks out of the window. The bus moves on.
The back window of the bus, half covered with a flapping yellow tarpaulin
moves on the dusty road. As it turns a corner, a sliver of the shimmering blue
ocean is revealed.
EXT. FOREST - DAY75 75
The sun shines through the canopy of tropical trees.
ANU (O.S.)
Cooo!
A bird somewhere responds with the same sound. Coo!
The camera tilts down and stops at Anu who is looking up at the trees.
ANU (CONT’D)
Coo!
She pauses to listen for the bird.
Prabha follows Anu and Parvaty through the leaves on a barely present path.
She carries the small maroon suitcase in one hand and pushes aside the leaves
with another. The women look small in the large expanse of the forest. First
time seen fully in her casual, loose Kurta, Prabha looks more at ease with her
body, walking casually.
ANU (CONT’D)
I am sure there are a lot of wild animals.
66.
(MORE)
67.
Thick mangroves appear on the side. They are tall and cover the entire surface
of the water.
Insect sounds emerge to create a hypnotic atmosphere.
ANU (CONT’D)
Are there any?
She stops to look at Parvaty who has also stopped to look at the mangroves.
Parvaty looks around.
PARVATY
It is this way.
She takes a turn behind a huge tree. Prabha and Anu follow. They disappear
behind the mangroves. There is a stillness all around. Only the cicadas buzz.
EXT. FOREST PATH - DAY76 76
The sounds of the forest picks up.
Slow track along a thick mangrove forest.
PARVATY (O.S.)
There is a story about these mangroves. They
would say that a spirit from the water would
come and roam in the forest at night,
devouring souls of the weak hearted.
A bush shakes behind Prabha.
She stops, and turns around to look behind her. But there is no one there.
The bush does not move any more.
She thinks she is mistaken and walks on.
Parvaty and Anu have walked ahead and Prabha joins them.
PARVATY (CONT’D)
As kids we used to play a game. Just to get
thrills.
(chuckles)
I was really quite good at it... I would always
win. (MORE)
67.
PARVATY (CONT’D)
68.
We would take turns to stand at night in the
forest alone... whoever stood the longest was
the winner.
The women emerge from a thick bush and walk almost bending as they do.
PARVATY (CONT’D)
Once I stayed out so late, they all thought I
got eaten by the spirit! No one had lasted
more than ten minutes before!
ANU (O.S.)
(curious)
Did you see it?
PARVATY (O.S.)
No. I thought it was my bad luck... but maybe
it is only when you are afraid of something
that you see it. If you are not afraid, it seizes
to exist!
Once again there is a shuffling sound between two of Peepul trees. This time it
is quite loud but only Prabha hears. She turns and walks to the spot. She waits.
Once again nothing moves.
Suddenly the wind comes and all the trees come alive!
Behind the bushes, Shiaz is crouching on all fours like an animal!
The forest feels mystical, as if with a life of its own.
EXT. BEACH - DAY77 77
An enormous expanse of the ocean lies ahead. The large waves froth as they hit
the beach.
PARVATY (O.S.)
I think as we grow old we become more
fearful... I have forgotten what it feels like to
be young.
Parvaty’s house is amongst a few houses in a tribal settlement, tucked away
between the beach and the forest. The houses have thatched roofs and are
made from mud and bamboo.
PARVATY (CONT’D)
68.
69.
Her house is painted off white and has a small courtyard in the front with
overgrown shrubs. Nearby are other mud houses part of the tribal settlement.
A rooster strolls in the courtyard. A small bell tied to the thatched roof tinkles
in the wind.
INT. PARVATY'S HOUSE - DAY78 78
Parvaty opens the windows of her old-fashioned house letting the light in. The
sparse pieces of furniture are covered in dust. Anu carries Parvaty’s bag and
keeps it near the window.
INT. PARVATY'S HOUSE - DAY79 79
Prabha and Anu unpack Parvaty's things. Prabha sits on the bed and hands Anu
clothes from the bag which she arranged on a shelf.
PRABHA
I can’t
ANU
Its easy!
PRABHA
I don’t know how to lie.
ANU
I will start...Number 1 - When I was 15, I won
the Miss Ernakulam Contest. Number 2- I have
seen Mammootty with my own eyes.
Prabha looks up, getting interested.
ANU (CONT’D)
And number 3.... I ran away from home once
because my mother wanted me to cut my
hair!
PRABHA
You saw Mammootty? That is a lie. How would
you see a big star like him?
Anu shakes her head.
69.
70.
ANU
You lose. I saw him!
Anu takes the last of the clothes and sits on the bed next to Prabha.
ANU (CONT’D)
I did participate in the Miss Ernakulam
Contest...but I lost.
(disappointed)
I didn't even make it through the first round!
PRABHA
It can happen...that the judges have bad
taste.
ANU
My mother said the same thing!
(warming up again)
Your turn.
PRABHA
No no... You go again.
ANU
One sided game?
Prabha is silent.
ANU (CONT’D)
Please?
PRABHA
(reluctant)
Ok... uh...
(pause)
Number 1, I always wanted to be a nurse.
Since I was a small kid. Its all I ever dreamt
of.
ANU
Number two?
PRABHA
Umm... Two... My parents once forgot me at a
temple. Maybe because I was always so
quiet...
70.
71.
ANU
Number three?
PRABHA
Umm...... Uh...
(lying)
Number 3, my husband invited me to come to
stay with him.
ANU
(hint of jealousy)
To Germany?
Prabha blushes and nods.
ANU (CONT’D)
(softly)
Oh... thats great..! You didn't tell me that you
called him.
Prabha does not respond.
ANU (CONT’D)
So which statement is a lie?
The second one?
PRABHA
(lying again)
Yea... sure.
Prabha looks dazed, as if in her own world.
ANU
(hesitant)
Prabha... Can I tell you something? My parents
are also looking for a guy...for me to marry.
Prabha looks up.
ANU (CONT’D)
But I don’t want to.
PRABHA
Why don’t you talk to them?
71.
72.
ANU
As if it is possible to speak to my father.
PRABHA
What will you do?
Anu shakes her head.
ANU
I don’t know what to do.
(smiles sadly)
Maybe run away...?
Prabha thinks about this.
PRABHA
(as if she is telling herself)
You can’t escape your fate...by running away.
Anu is surprised, her smile fades.
INT. KITCHEN - DAY80 80
Anu leans against the kitchen counter.
ANU
I am very tired... I want to rest for a bit.
PARVATY
You are the youngest, isn’t it!
Anu looks at Prabha.
PRABHA
(in Malayalam)
Are you sure? I thought you loved the sea!
Anu nods.
ANU
(Malayalam)
I’m very tired.
72.
73.
PRABHA
(to Parvaty)
Let her be...She did carry the big bag.
Anu watches as Prabha and Parvaty leave. They are seen through the window,
walking towards the beach. Closing one eye, Anu raises her index finger. She
covers Prabha entirely with it.
EXT. BEACH - DAY81 81
Pine and eucalyptus trees, bend in the wind
Sound of the waves hitting the beach.
A group of six, bare-chested fishermen push a large yellow fishing boat into the
water. Tanned in the top sun, their dark bodies glisten as the waves crash
against their muscular legs. The boat is heavy, and they struggle to get it into
the water. They heave they bodies forward in synchronised and sensuous unity.
Prabha, standing at the edge of the sea, watches them.
PARVATY (O.S.)
Oye!
Parvaty is submerged in the water in her sari in the distance. She waves her
hand, encouraging Prabha to come into the ocean.
Prabha raises her hand and declines the invitation. She turns once more to the
men. They have managed to thrust the boat into the water.
She looks down, the water encircles her feet, frothing and submerging them. As
the water recedes, her feet have sunk into the sand.
CUT TO:
Prabha is hesitant but goes slowly into the water.
Cautious at first, Prabha adjusts to her new surroundings. Now she too is
submerged up to her waist. She turns and looks in the distance.
The fishing boat with the men, moves away from Prabha towards the vast
ocean.
All other sounds have vanished, only the motor hum of the boat remains, as it
mixes with the wind. The sound of Prabha’s breath
73.
74.
Suddenly, a waves hits her! Losing her balance, she slips into the water. The
wave recedes. She resurfaces, completely wet! She regains control of her body.
She stays floating, tilting her neck backwards, giving into the movement of the
waves.
All sounds are submerged.
Prabha stares at the sky.
Reddish-brown cloud of smoke rises languorously from the engine of the fishing
boat and floats in the sky like a snake.
Slowly, it eclipses the sun.
EXT. FOREST NEAR PARVATY’S HOUSE - DAY82 82
In her wet outfit, Prabha crouches and pees. She is surrounded by tall trees.
She stands up, a solitary figure. She tries to move her wet clothes such that
they doesn’t cling to her body. She runs her hands over her breasts, touching
her wet body, as if looking at it anew.
She looks up again, towards the sun.
Through the canopy of trees, the sun sparkles.
EXT. FOREST NEAR PARVATY’S HOUSE- DAY83 83
Prabha makes her way back, walking through the forest. In her wet dress she
looks less stiff. For the first time, she looks as if she is at ease in the jungle.
She moves aside branches and shrubs as she makes her way back. All around
the forest sounds rise. She stops for a moment.Water glistens on her dark skin.
EXT. FOREST NEAR PARVATY’S HOUSE- DAY84 84
Prabha comes to a clearing. She hears something. She stops abruptly. She hears
some voices emerging from the nearby bushes. She stays absolutely still, trying
to listen. She takes a few steps towards the bushes. She bends, bringing her ear
closer to them. She moves a few leaves aside. She look in.
Voices in Malayalam waft out from behind. Crouching, Prabha listens with a
look of surprise.
74.
75.
ANU (O.S.)
I should get back now
SHIAZ (O.S.)
Will you be long?
ANU (O.S.)
No..not long
SHIAZ (O.S.)
Kiss me again...
Prabha raises herself to get a better view.
Through the leaves, she sees Anu and Shiaz kiss.
ANU
Ok save some for later!
Prabha, still crouching, looks on, her eyes wide open.
Sound of Anu and Shiaz walking away.
Prabha continues to crouch. She looks awkward, not quite knowing what to do
with herself. She stands up carefully. She seems stunned. She walks back as if
in a daze.
EXT. PETHA VILLAGE - DAY85 85
A farmer burns the dried leaves in his field. The smoke rises slowly
The sound becomes distant, and only the dull hum of the burning leaves
interspersed with the crackling fire can be heard.
EXT. COURTYARD - DAY86 86
Prabha’s wet clothes hang on the line in the courtyard. A gust of wind makes
wave-like ripples on the floral surface.
75.
76.
INT. PARVATY’S HOUSE - DAY87 87
Sitting on the floor, Prabha, Parvaty and Anu eat lunch. Prabha has changed
into one of Parvaty’s local style Maharashtrian saris. She watches them, barely
touching her food.
ANU
The fish is excellent Parvati
PARVATY
You can take me to the city but I won’t forget
my traditional dishes.
PRABHA
How long will you be gone for?
PARVATY
The bungalow is an hour away from here. If I
leave now, I can be back by 5...I only need to
tell them I’m here for the job...
ANU
I could take a long nap after this meal !
PRABHA
I think we should leave then...it will become
late.
Parvaty and Anu look up at Prabha
PARVATY
No come on Prabha! You stay till the
evening...
Anu looks nervous.
PARVATY (CONT’D)
We can get some crabs for dinner too... then
you can take the night bus back.
ANU
You are spoiling us !
PARVATY
It is the least I can do! You came all the way
76.
77.
ANU
I don't mind. It was a holiday for us! As if Dr.
Supriya ever gives leave
Prabha looks at Anu, visibly unsettled. But she remains silent, quietly eating
her food.
EXT. VILLAGE - DAY88 88
The smoke from the fields wafts past Prabha’s sari which is still drying on the
line outside the house.
INT. PARVATY’S HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY89 89
The smoke meanders past the window of the kitchen. The utensils that were
used to prepare the meal are still on the table.
INT. PARVATY’S HOUSE - DAY90 90
Prabha and Anu lie next to each other on the bed in Parvaty’s room. In the door
to the backyard, the smoke passes. Unseen to Anu, Prabha’s eyes are open.
After a while, Anu turns and looks up at the window and then down at Prabha.
Prabha quickly closes her eyes. Slowly, Anu tip-toes over Prabha.
Anu reaches the outer door and puts on his shoes. She sneaks out, checks that
no one has seen her. She leaves.
Prabha watches the door, then turns around. She decides to let Anu go. She
closes her eyes.
EXT. VILLAGE - DAY91 91
Anu walks away in the distance, crossing a large meadow. She walks into a line
of trees, disappearing behind them.
She walks quickly through the trees as the forest around her gets thicker.
EXT. FOREST - DAY92 92
The forest, seen from above, stretches on till the eyes can see. Smoke rises
slowly, making its way through the thick canopy.

78.
SHIAZ (V.O.)
(calm, levelled voice)
I heard someone coming into the jungle...and
my first thought was, it is you?... I got up
and looked around. There, I saw a group of
soldiers coming towards me. And they started
shouting, catch him catch him.
EXT. FOREST - DAY93 93
In the forest, a SOLDIER is eating a small orange, peeling it and putting the
pulp in his mouth. Another SOLDIER is cleaning his gun nearby while a third
SOLDIER walks at the back, feeding a brown dog.
There is no sound from the scene. Only the sounds of crickets chirping and a
dull hum, lingering on from the smoke.
SHIAZ (V.O.)
Amongst them, I saw a large, older man. And
when I looked close, I saw that he had your
father’s face... but he too was a soldier!
Track forward into the dog as it vanishes behind a bush, the sound of its feet on
the dried leaves. The Soldier follows.
SHIAZ (V.O.)
They started shouting... there is the
terrorist... catch him, catch him! Don’t let
him go.....I ran as fast as I could...
(genuinely scared)
I was shit scared...
The Soldier stops, takes a few cautious steps forward, sensing something ahead
of him. He peers, looking behind the bushes.
CUT TO:
Anu sits in a clearing in the forest. She listens to the dream with a pensive
look.
SHIAZ (O.S.)
(more matter of fact)
I ran as fast as I could. I didn’t look back but.
I could hear their voices behind me.
(MORE)
78.
SHIAZ (O.S.) (CONT'D)
79.
And their footsteps...it felt as if there were
hundreds of them and if they would catch me,
they would kill me for sure.
Anu is silent, visibly affected by the dream. She gets up and takes a few steps
away from Shiaz.
SHIAZ (CONT’D)
Anyway...It was only a dream...
Anu nods.
ANU
Yea...
Shiaz comes close to her. He kisses her neck. She turns to look back down the
path on which she came
SHIAZ
Come, I want to show you a place I found.
He takes his small bag and they walk deeper into the forest. Anu watches
Shiaz’s back.
I/E. SHRINE - DAY94 94
They walk along an old shrine with broken stone walls and cave like structures.
There are several arches made from stones, through which grow Banyan tree
roots and moss.
INT. SHRINE - DAY95 95
The shrine is very dark. The faint outlines of the walls and statues are visible in
the dim light.
Their footsteps echo. Somewhere inside, the sound of dripping water.
Anu’s cell phone torch comes on and the light falls on statues on the wall of
voluptuous figures- gods, goddesses and other celestial beings. As the torchlight
passes on them, the statues are revealed and then vanish. Their face and eyes
have a delicate look but the bodies have broken over time. Their beautiful
almond shaped eyes look down on the couple and the celestial beings have
delicate smiles on their lips.
SHIAZ (O.S.) (CONT'D)
79.
80.
The light and shadow of the passing torch creates a a sense of movement, like
characters in a film. It looks animated, even though they are still.
ANU
How did you find this place?
Anu’s torchlight stops on a particularly beautiful statue of a female. It vaguely
resembles Anu. The torchlight swings left and right over the face.
ANU (O.S.) (CONT’D)
(whispering)
Doesn’t it look like her eyes are following
me?
Anu walks ahead along the wall, moving the torchlight as she goes. The circular
light passes now over a jagged rock wall till it comes to a curved, smooth wall.
The wall is covered in modern day graffiti written in Hindi, Marathi and English.
Couples have scratched their names into the wall with hearts or ‘I love you’, ‘U
and me 4Ever’.
Anu is fascinated by her discovery. She looks closely at the marks, touching
them and reading them under her breath.
ANU (CONT’D)
(whisper)
Renu is only for Minesh.... Pappu and Shalu...
forever.
Her eyes widen as she discovers the graffiti spread all over. The torch moves
over some graffiti:
‘love conquers all...’
Anu keeps looking at it.
ANU (CONT’D)
I like this place...it has an another-worldly
feeling about it.
(sigh)
As if only you and I can see it... no one
else...
She walks and turns a corner, entering an even darkener part of the cave. It is
almost pitch dark here. As she walks, her expression becomes serious. Her face
moves in and out of the shadowy lights.
80.
(MORE)
81.
ANU (CONT’D)
Shiaz
SHIAZ (O.S.)
Hmm?
Anu sits down on a rock and leans against the wall. She turns off her torch.
ANU
Do you ever think about... what things will be
like in the future?
Shiaz’s voice floats in from another part of the cave
SHIAZ (O.S.)
What do you mean?
ANU
I mean like... the future...like in ten years
time... or twenty years time... What will your
life be like?
SHIAZ (O.S.)
I think about it sometimes
ANU
Am I there... with you?
SHIAZ (O.S.)
What has come over you?
ANU
I don’t know... I never used to really think
about the future, you know... but now I feel
as if the future has arrived and I am not
prepared for it...
Anu closes her eyes for a moment. Shiaz comes close to her and sits down next
to her. He is smoking a beedi. He takes a puff. They are both silent. Anu looks
down.
ANU (CONT’D)
I remember there was this boy I liked in
school...I was 12 years old... We used to take
the school bus together.
(MORE)
81.
ANU (CONT’D)
82.
At that time...the height of romance was to
be sitting next to each other in the school
bus. I did.. one time.I had been waiting for
that day for so long, but when it actually
happened, I fest terrified I felt like... if my
father found out, he would take me out of
school.
(pause)
I feel like that now... like that 12 year old
girl.
SHIAZ
He was very strict with you wasn't he?
Anu nods
ANU
Why don’t my parents understand what I
want?...
SHIAZ
Maybe we can talk to them... make them
understand. You never know...people can
surprise you.
ANU
I am afraid that...If I tell them about you...
they will never let me see you again...
(pause)
Shiaz, I am scared
She rests her head on his shoulder.
SHIAZ
I have been scared since I met you.
He has a nervous smile as he blows out the smoke. Then he becomes serious
again as he takes a few more puffs
SHIAZ (CONT’D)
I used to ask myself many times... if I was
doing the right thing being with you....or it
would have been best to stay apart.
She looks up at him
ANU (CONT’D)
82.
83.
SHIAZ (CONT’D)
But then ...when I am with you… I don't know
what it is… I feel not afraid at all.. As if this Is
the most natural way for us to be.
He takes another puff
SHIAZ (CONT’D)
Its all too heavy for me sometimes..
Anu looks at Shiaz. She takes his hands and puts it in hers. Shiaz looks
melancholic.
Sound of cicadas picks up slowly as Anu and Shiaz sit quietly.
CUT TO:
Anu walks along the walls of the cave, making her way out carefully.
Sound of the cicadas buzz creating a strange hum.
She notices something and stops
ANU
Shiaz... look... there is graffiti here in
Malayalam...
She reads it.
ANU (CONT’D)
Our love is endless like the sea..
We shall flow with it wherever it takes us...
Anu reads it again, but this time in her mind. She looks around. In the far
distance, she sees Shiaz, looking at her.
ANU (CONT’D)
You wrote it... didn't you?
Shiaz does not speak. He looks at her from the distance, the gentle beam of
the sun illuminates his curly hair with. They stand there, caught in each others
gaze.
83.
84.
INT. CAVE - DAY96 96
Lying on a blue blanket, Shiaz and Anu kiss each other. Shiaz begins to kiss
Anu’s neck. Slowly, he raises her up a bit and she helps him take off her yellow
blouse. Her curls cascade over her dark skin. Shiaz lays her back down again
and he kisses her body. He kisses her breasts.. She lifts his face and he moves
up again, once again they kiss passionately.
Shiaz is now on top of Anu and they are making love. His body moves over her
gently, the shadowy canopy of leaves makes shifting patters on his back. She
holds his back, her pink nails glistening against his skin.
I/E. BEACH SHACK - DAY97 97
In a make-shift bamboo beach shack, A GIRL (15-years- old) , takes out a coke
from a small glass fridge. She has short hair and a thin moustache that give her
an androgynous look. She wears a t-shirt and jeans. She shuts the door with her
foot and clinks open the bottle.
Music plays from the phone in her pocket. It moves with her wherever she
moves.
She walks past the few people in the shack and stops at one table where
Prabha has her head bent down. She looks at Prabha for a moment. She places
the coke on the table.
THE GIRL
(in Marathi)
You want anything else?
Prabha looks up, confused not understanding.
THE GIRL (CONT’D)
(in Hindi)
Is there anything else you want?
Prabha shakes her head.
The Girl walks to the cashier’s counter where her FATHER is the cashier. He is
reading a newspaper. She leans against the counter. She sways a bit, moving to
the music. She puts her face near the rotating fan and cools herself.
FATHER (O.S.)
How many times do I have to tell you? Turn it
off.
84.
85.
The Girl reluctantly turns the music off. Lazily, she walks to the bamboo pole
and looks out at the beach.
Some loud shouting is heard from the beach. People are heard running and
shouting from one end to the other.
FATHER (CONT’D)
(not turning from the paper)
Check what it is?
The Girl walks to the beach and looks.
Others also come out to see.
Offscreen, shouting gets louder.
Prabha sits up. She cranes her neck to see. She gets up and looks at the beach,
and then walks out of the shack.
She joins the Girl and the others who have stood up to look.
In the distance, men from the yellow fishing boat are pulling out a large
creature, wrapped up in a blue fishing net. They haul the net over their
shoulders and carry it out on to the beach, to a dry spot.
EXT. BEACH - DAY98 98
Prabha walks swiftly in the direction of the boat. People run past her. Prabha
looks around. She walks very fast, and then she too breaks into a run, making
her way towards the commotion.
EXT. BEACH - DAY99 99
Several of the tourists and locals have all collected to see what the net holds.
They stand together, watching with worried expressions. Pushing the crowd
aside, Prabha emerges. She looks down.
Covered by the blue net, a tall, well built, DROWNED MAN is entangled with
mud and seaweed. He is on his belly, motionless.
Prabha sits down next to the Drowned Man. Then she swings into action and
turns his body. People around obediently help her as she is the only one who
seems to know what to do.
85.
86.
She shifts the net delicately off of his face. He is in his late 30s, and had deep
lines in his face. His hair is curly and stuck close to his head. He has a broad
chest and a tattoo on his arm. He is not breathing.
The crowd has swelled.
FISHER WOMAN 1
Is he one of ours?
FISHER WOMAN 2
Does not look familiar.
FISHER WOMAN 1
No. Never seen him before.
Prabha waves her hand, indicating that the crowd should fall back. Everyone
quietens down. Prabha starts to pump his chest vigorously. She listens to his
heartbeat once every few moments and then continues with the pumping. Her
arms begin to get slower with every move. No change in his condition. She
thinks for a moment and then bends down and breathes into his mouth.
People around murmur.
She keeps breathing, holding his face and nose. Suddenly Drowned Man coughs
up water.
People around start talking. Some even clap. Others pat Prabha on her back.
Drowned Man opens his eyes and looks up at Prabha.
Prabha too looks at him.
Before she can say anything, he has already slumped back, unconscious. Prabha
touches his shoulder trying to reawaken him but his body is limp.
PRABHA
He needs to see a doctor.
The crowd murmurs and talk amongst themselves in the local dialect. The head
fisherman looks apologetically.
FISHERMAN
Madam, the closest doctor is 80 KM away... It
will be a while before he can reach here.
86.
87.
EXT. BEACH - DAY100 100
The Drowned Man is carried by the fishermen on their shoulders. He looks as if
he is floating against the sky, his bare, mud covered body, against the swaying
trees. His movement is like waves or the movement of a camel.
The long procession of people take the man along the beach. Prabha walks with
the procession of people. Everyone is curious to see what will happen. She is
one of them, in a mass of humans, carrying this Drowned Man on their heads.
I/E. FRONT PORCH OF VILLAGE HOUSE - EARLY EVENING101 101
Prabha waits on the porch of an old village house. It is much larger, more
affluent than Parvaty’s hut, with red clay flooring, a tiled roof and strong
wooden beams. It is clearly an ‘upper-caste’ house.
The sound of evening cicadas and a small wind chime tinkling on the window of
the house.
An OLD WOMAN wearing a traditional white short sari comes out from inside,
her back bent. Her bare shoulders are dark and wrinkled and she is missing a
few teeth.
OLD WOMAN
(Marathi)
Miss... You can sit inside with your husband.
PRABHA
Oh...
Prabha stands up.
PRABHA (CONT’D)
(Hindi)
No... He is not my husband.
OLD WOMAN
(not understanding Hindi)
Come come... You don’t have to be shy.
The Old Woman hobbles into the house.
87.
88.
INT. HOUSE - EVENING102 102
Prabha sees the Drowned Man laying on a large bed. All the windows of the
room are open. Outside, a beetle-nut plantation can be seen.
A mosquito net has been put over the bed, tied up on top, and he lays in bed
without moving. He is shirtless and covered up to his waist with a light quilt.
The contours of his body can be seen.
OLD WOMAN
Don’t worry… my dear... Will you have some
tea?
Prabha shakes her head.
OLD WOMAN (CONT’D)
Don’t be shy…
The woman leaves. Prabha watches her, feeling terribly awkward.
Prabha comes and sits on the chair near him. She sees that there is still mud on
his body. She takes out her handkerchief from her purse, pours water on it from
the jug nearby, and starts wiping his bare chest.
After a long while, he opens his eyes. He turns his head and looks at her. Seeing
him see herself, she feels shy and withdraws her hand. They don’t speak. He
looks tired. He closes his eyes again.
He is still for a long time. Prabha hesitates but then resumes her duties as his
nurse.
She sees a bruise under his right nipple. She applies some medicine made from
turmeric on the wound. At first there is no reaction from him. Suddenly, he
flinches. His face grimaces and he holds her wrist, as if asking her to stop, his
eyes still shut
PRABHA
(apologetic)
Sorry...
He stays like that for a moment and they are both suspended in this awkward
gesture. She doesn’t know what to do. She can’t move much. Then he opens his
eyes, and looks up at her. A weak smile appears on his lips and he gently lets go
of her wrist. She hastily puts away the turmeric.
He looks at her silently and then nods his head ever so slightly, still in a daze
88.
89.
DROWNED MAN (O.S.)
(in Malayalam)
it pains...
Prabha is surprised. She looks at him, confused, then does not know how to
respond.
PRABHA
Oh...
(in Malayalam)
Yes, it will pain but soon you will be ok...
DROWNED MAN (O.S.)
What happened?
He tries to sit up but is unable to.
PRABHA
(Smiling kindly)
Just lay back...
He slumps back down.
DROWNED MAN
(breathing)
I can’t remember.
Someone knocks on the door and Prabha stops being so friendly and looks
towards it. She moves her hands back to her lap.
The Old Woman walks in carrying with her a tray with some tea and biscuits.
Prabha takes it from her and lays them on the table. Old Woman looks at the
Drowned Man and then hobbles to close the curtains of the room.
OLD WOMAN
Dear, he will catch a chill with the
draft...cover him nicely, dear.
The two watch silently as the Old Woman shuts the curtains. The light on their
faces changes into a shadow diffused light.
OLD WOMAN (O.S.) (CONT’D)
What does he do?
89.
90.
Prabha looks at him but he does not respond. He just stares at Prabha. It is
unclear whether he can’t understand the language or if he can’t remember
what he does. Prabha feels strange that she is being asked this question.
PRABHA
(Hindi)
I think there is some misunderstanding...
OLD WOMAN
(broken Hindi)
Where does your husband work?
Prabha looks back at the Old Woman and then decides to answer truthfully
about her own husband.
PRABHA
He, umm, works in Germany, in a factory.
The Old Woman turns to look at her, visibly impressed.
OLD WOMAN
You too?
Prabha shakes her head.
OLD WOMAN (CONT’D)
Then you must not be seeing each other
often.
PRABHA
No…
OLD WOMAN
It’s a pity your holiday was ruined….
She walks away from them and stands at the door.
Prabha looks at the lady, blushing, she looks down.
OLD WOMAN (O.S.) (CONT’D)
Nothing to feel shy... your tea will be cold.
Prabha waits till she hears the door shutting. She turns back to the Drowned
Man and is a little flushed.
90.
91.
DROWNED MAN
(Malayalam)
What did she say?
Prabha shakes her head.
PRABHA
Nothing...that you might catch a chill.
INT. HOUSE - LATER103 103
Prabha makes him sit up, with his legs off the bed on the side such that they sit
side by side. He towers over her. She pours some tea into the saucer and hands
it to him. He is barely able to lift his arm but holds on to the saucer. It shakes a
little in his hand. She stabilises it with her own. He takes a sip. But some of the
tea falls on him.
Prabha automatically takes her handkerchief and starts to wipe it. He watches
her and she realises it is a bit odd what she is doing so she stops and looks
sheepishly at him. He smiles at her awkwardness. Garnering some strength, he
takes the hanky from her and wipes himself.
For a moment, they sit in silence and drink tea. The wind picks up outside.
DROWNED MAN
What is your name?
PRABHA
Prabha...
DROWNED MAN
(repeats)
Prabha…
He tries to put the saucer away. She helps him.
PRABHA
You should rest more.
DROWNED MAN
I feel I have been sleeping for very long.
How long has it been?
PRABHA
A few hours... maybe.
91.
92.
He looks down at the little bit of mud that still remains on his body and tries to
pull it off with his hand.
DROWNED MAN
What is this?
PRABHA
It is mud from the sea. They pulled you out
of the water.
DROWNED MAN
What was I doing there?
She smiles at his helplessness, and looks at him kindly.
PRABHA
You don’t remember?
He shakes his head ‘no’
The wind is blowing, the curtains on the opposite wall flutter, the camera
moves slowly tracking into them, in slow motion. The movement of the curtains
feel as if they dancing in the wind. It is a magical atmosphere that surrounds
them.
PRABHA (O.S) (CONT’D)
(whispering)
You’ve changed so much in these years...
DROWNED MAN (O.S.)
(whisper)
Have I?
PRABHA (O.S.)
(whisper)
Hmmm
The spell still remains in the sound.
The Drowned Man looks down at Prabha’s hands. He turns to her for a moment.
DROWNED MAN
There would be days in the factory where I
would be stuck for long. I wouldn’t know if it
was day or night... I would come out after
3-4 days... as if from a daze...
92.
93.
Prabha looks up at him.
DROWNED MAN (CONT’D)
I was blinded by the light... You try to imagine
light, but in the darkness, you cannot... I
thought about you...
PRABHA
What did you think of?
DROWNED MAN
Sitting next to you like this. The light on your
face. I wanted to reach out and touch you,
but...
Prabha looks down at her hands and breathes a little. She turns away. He
reaches out and touches her hand, turning over her palm. He moves his finger
over it.
PRABHA
You never told me this before.
DROWNED MAN
I didn’t know it myself...
Prabha looks up at him. He lifts her palm and kisses it right in the centre. He
keeps kissing her palm and her finger. She sits there, looking at him. Prabha
smiles shyly.
He continues to kiss her palm, and then he kisses her whole arm. Her
expression changes. A tear runs down her face. He continues to kiss her.
Through her tears, she starts to smile. Her smile is beautiful, in the dull light of
the room.
EXT. FOREST - LATE EVENING104 104
Evening light dances on the treetops. The trees look like dark shapes against
the magic light in the sky.
Mist has settled on the canopy of the forest.
EXT. BEACH - LATE EVENING105 105
Sound of the ocean waves unfurling on the sandy beach, create a soft rhythm.
93.
94.
The waves move gently over the sand, catching only a hint of light.
EXT. BEACH SHACK - LATE EVENING106 106
Under a lonesome tube light, blue and red crates are stacked up against the
back wall of the make-shift bamboo shack. Pushing past the curtain of the back
door, the same androgynous Girl seen before, carries a red crate filled with
empty glass bottles that clink as she walks. She stacks up the crate. Through
the fluttering curtain, her Father is searching for something at his counter.
FATHER
Where is my torch?
Returning inside, she leans over the counter and hands him his torch.
INT. BEACH SHACK- LATE EVENING107 107
The Girl wipes the glass fridge with a cloth. The pink fairy lights above the
counter blink off and on in a slow rhythm. Her Father closes the drawer and
goes to the front door. Not looking up, she continues to work.
FATHER (O.S.)
Shut it when they leave.
She turns to look in his direction.
EXT. BEACH SHACK - LATE EVENING108 108
The Girl comes to the front door, putting the napkin on her shoulder, she
watches the beach. In the distance, the torchlight in her Father’s hand
diminishes as he walks further away.
Prabha and Parvaty drink tea and Anu drinks coke.
PARVATY
(in Marathi)
Are you shutting ?
The Girl shakes her head.
GIRL
(in Marathi)
You can sit as long as you like.
94.
95.
Parvaty nods. The Girl goes back in.
PARVATY
It’s beautiful isn’t it? Aren’t you glad you
stayed?
Prabha nods. They watch the sun setting in front of them.
From behind a boat kept upside down in the distance on the beach, Shiaz bends
down as he picks up a matchbox he has dropped. Prabha notices him.
PARVATY (CONT’D)
Will you have anything else?
Anu shakes her head.
PARVATY (CONT’D)
Prabha?
Prabha is still looking in the direction of Shiaz. Parvaty also turns to look. Anu
notices that Prabha is looking at Shiaz.
PARVATY (CONT’D)
What is it?
Prabha turns to Anu.
PRABHA
Anu has her mind here but her heart is
somewhere else
Anu freezes.
PRABHA (CONT’D)
(in Malayalam)
Isn’t it so?
Anu looks unsure of what to do. Prabha looks back at Shiaz and then at Anu.
PRABHA (CONT’D)
Its ok, call him here.
Anu looks hesitant, Prabha gives her a reassuring look.
PRABHA (CONT’D)
Call him...
95.
96.
Anu, still a little unsure, stands up and walks towards Shiaz.
PARVATY
Who is that?
PRABHA
Anu’s boyfriend.
Parvaty chuckles
PARVATY
She should hold on to him if he followed her
this far.
Prabha smiles. The couple join them and Prabha brings nearer a chair for Shiaz
to sit
PRABHA
Where are you from?
SHIAZ
Wayanad
Prabha nods
PRABHA
I have been there once... its very beautiful
there
Shiaz nods.
PRABHA (CONT’D)
It is very beautiful here too
She turns to look at the ocean. The waves crash against the shore.
CUT TO:
INT. BEACH SHACK - NIGHT109 109
The Girl takes her mobile phone and sticks in the cord of the speakers. She
puts on the song that her Father had made her turn off before.
A Konkani pop song plays.
96.
97.
FEMALE SINGER
Life is a fleeting wisp of the wind,
And I try to hold it in the palm of my hand.
But the more closely my fists close,
The more easily it slips away...
But I am happy that the wind,
Still dances in the trees,
And before me, I can say with delight,
There is only life, life, life.
EXT. BEACH SHACK - NIGHT110 110
The Girl turns off one light outside.
FEMALE SINGER
Mother called me, “look a song bird sings in
the trees!”
She said, ‘hold it in the palm of your hand’,
But the more close I went to catch it,
The more swiftly it flew to the branches of
trees,
But I am happy that the trees still dance to
its song
And before me, I can say with delight,
There is only life, life, life!
The beach shack is an oasis of light in the dark blue beach.Through the window
on another wall, the interiors of the shack are seen, illuminated in the blinking
pink light. And in the light, the Girl moves her body to the rhythm. She mouths
the words. The ease of her body movement increases gradually as she gives
herself in to the music, dancing alone in the beach shack.
The sound of the music fills the darkness.
FEMALE SINGER (CONT’D)
Father called me, ‘look at the waves in the
sea’
He said, ‘hold them in the palm of your
hand’,
But the more I tried to catch them
The more they took me with them.
And now I float away from you…
To where the waves and the wind take me
And I can say with delight…
There is only life, life, life.
97.
