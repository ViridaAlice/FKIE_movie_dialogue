NIGHTBITCH
INT. MORNING - KITCHEN1 1
The MOTHER, 42 and more tired than anyone has ever been,
hunches over the sink, sipping a cup of coffee while her 2
year old son plays with trains at her feet - she’s a bit of a
zombie. She stares ahead - not actively. Everything about her
is passive. Outside the light of very early morning peeks
through the suburban trees.
MOTHER (V.O.)
You light a fire early in your
girlhood. You stoke it and tend to
it. You protect it at all costs.
You don’t let it rage into a
mountain of light because that’s
not becoming of a girl.
The mother pulls out a heavy skillet, puts it on the stove.
Puts a pat of butter in it and turns on the burner. She opens
the freezer and stares in.
MOTHER (V.O.)
You keep it secret. You let it burn
- a white hot light at the center
of yourself.
Her son paws at her leg to come up, so she picks him up,
gives him a quick kiss on the head, and continues expertly
with one hand. She pulls out a box of frozen hash browns,
throws 3 in the pan. She stares at the pan as it begins to
sizzle.
MOTHER
(to her son)
Hot!
MOTHER (V.O.)
You look into the eyes of other
girls and see their fires
flickering there, under the
surface.
Her son squirms and then barks.
SON
Woof woof!
MOTHER
Okay, doggie.
So she puts him back down with his trains and his stuffed dog
toy.
NIGHTBITCH Pink Revisions September 6, 2022 2
MOTHER (V.O.)
It’s from this point - this fire -
you can create, and fight and push
your way through the world. It’s
from this fire that you can birth
something new - a new version of
yourself, or a whole new person who
didn’t exist before you squeezed
them into the world.
She looks at her son, smashing trains together.
MOTHER (V.O.)
A person who will one day pee in
your face without blinking.
She sips her coffee again, quietly defeated.
MOMENTS LATER The mother and son sit on tiny colorful chairs
at a tiny colorful table and both shovel hash browns into
their mouths. Silent and content like an old married couple
who has run out of things to say.

EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - LATER THAT MORNING3 3
The Mother and her son walk hand in hand down the street.
Slowly. The pace of a two year old.
Moments later, they stand watching a garbage truck slowly
making it’s way down the street. A garbage man hangs off the
back, throwing cans into the back.
MOTHER
Oh, that looks like a heavy bag,
doesn’t it? He’s strong.
They sit down on the curb to watch the show. The mother waves
at the garbage man, who waves back. The mother and son share
an excited moment: HE WAVED AT US!
INT. LIBRARY - LATER THAT MORNING4 4
The mother and son enter the main part of the library
quietly. The mother smiles at NORMA, the older librarian
behind the counter, who eyes her suspiciously.
MOTHER
(whispered)
Hi Norma.
The mother and the son walk to the back of the library, where
the children’s section is and spot a circle of kids and
caregivers in the corner.
MOTHER (CONT’D)
(quietly to herself)
Shit. (then to son)
Baby, we should go.
SON
No mama! Stay!
She reluctantly gets pulled by him to the circle time across
the room. They take a seat on the frayed rug next to all the
other toddlers and caregivers. Our mother is not thrilled.
The Book Babies LEADER, a very enthusiastic man with a
guitar, sings:
NIGHTBITCH Pink Revisions September 6, 2022 3

LEADER
(singing)
His tail is a shoe
And he’s sitting on water skies
Oh what’s up what’s up
With that duck that duck
Oh what’s up with that duck?
The singing continues.
MOTHER (V.O.)
The problem is I just don’t enjoy
the company of moms.
She looks around at the other moms: the mom wiping snot from
her kid’s nose, the mom singing along with hand gestures, and
the mom who’s giving her daughter a death glare and mouthing
“sit down now”.
NIGHTBITCH Locked White Shooting Draft July 30, 2022 3A
NIGHTBITCH Blue Revisions August 30, 2022 4
MOTHER (V.O.)
I feel like beginning a friendship
with another woman simply because
we are both mothers is repugnant.
She looks at one mom, a COOL MOM, well dressed in black, who
glances at her phone sneakily, and seems approachable.
MOTHER (V.O.)
I mean, if I happened to meet a
beautiful, smart, hilarious woman
and we became friends... Someone
who would get wine drunk on a
Tuesday afternoon, for example...
The cool mom wrangles her kid and sneaks out of the room,
with a small ‘thank you’. Our mother looks disappointed. The
leader starts a new song.
LEADER
(singing)
It’s time to say goodbye. Goodbye
to our friends. Goodbye to Ava.
He points to one of the young kids.
LEADER (CONT’D)
And goodbye to Jack.
The mother glances around and notices JEN, 35 and perfectly
put together with a huge diaper bag organized with snacks and
wipes at the ready, looking right at her smiling. Jen waves
at our mother enthusiastically. The mother looks around,
almost confused then gives a little head nod to say hi. The
leader’s song comes around to our son.
LEADER (CONT’D)
And goodbye to -
SON
RUFF!
The mother smiles nervously, leaning in to whisper in her
son’s ear, pleading.
LEADER
What’s your name little buddy? Can
you sing it?
NIGHTBITCH Blue Revisions August 30, 2022 4
NIGHTBITCH Locked White Shooting Draft July 30, 2022 5
SON
WOOF WOOF RUFF!
The mother laughs nervously feeling like everyone is looking
at her, and they move along.
INT. LIBRARY - LATER5 5
As Book Babies wraps up, all of the moms and nannies start
collecting their belongings. JEN, peppy as can be with kids
in matching outfits, approaches our Mother who is trying to
leave.
JEN
Do you like paint and sip?
MOTHER
Excuse me?
JEN
You’re an artist right?
MOTHER
Did I...tell you that?
JEN
Oh, we chatted at Mommy Baby Yoga!
Just for a sec though. Jen. So do
you paint...or something else?
MOTHER
Oh no. I used to do more immersive
art- sculptures and found
materials.
Two other mothers, the wingmen to Jen, wander closer to this
conversation not subtly. MIRIAM, ombre hair and very much a
mom, excitedly interjects.
MIRIAM
Like installations?
(then)
Sorry to eavesdrop. I’m a big art
fan.
MOTHER
Oh are you?
MIRIAM
Yeah.
The other lurking mom, LIZ, 30s and a professional mom,
visibly pregnant, also joins in.
NIGHTBITCH Locked White Shooting Draft July 30, 2022 5
NIGHTBITCH Blue Revisions August 30, 2022 6
LIZ
Me too. I used to live in the city
and spent my lunch break at the
modern like every day.
MOTHER
Oh I had work that showed at the
modern once.
The mothers all gasp and “ah”. Our Mother smiles, slightly
uncomfortable.
MOTHER (CONT’D)
Feels like a lifetime ago.
JEN/MIRIAM/LIZ
Oh totally/yeah/right?
MIRIAM
I used to be a stripper. If you can
believe that.
The other moms all look at her in surprise, nobody knowing
what to say but trying to look non-judgmental.
MIRIAM (CONT’D)
Just for a little while. But I just
couldn’t feel further from that
life now.
JEN
The before times, right?
They all share a knowing laugh, glancing at their children.
Liz pulls out silicone yogurt squeezy packs from her bag.
MOTHER
(to Jen)
Is that yogurt?
JEN
Kefir. Homemade- with chia seeds
and cardamom. Do you want one for
your son?
The mom looks to her son who is growling at the other
children on all fours.
MOTHER
Oh that’s ok. I gotta get him home
for his nap.
She grabs for her son, who runs from her grasp. She laughs
nervously, the other mothers all nod in understanding.
NIGHTBITCH Blue Revisions August 30, 2022 6
NIGHTBITCH Locked White Shooting Draft July 30, 2022 7
JEN
Maybe we’ll see you next week?
MOTHER
(very tentatively)
Maybe.
The mother grabs her wiggling son.
MOTHER (CONT’D)
(quietly to her son)
Please don’t have a tantrum, please
don’t have a tantrum.
They head for the door. The other mothers all watch her go,
excited by the prospect of a new friend.
INT./EXT. - MORNING SEQUENCE6 6
A series of images one after another:
The skillet clunks onto the stovetop.
A pat of butter plops into the skillet and begins to melt.
Hashbrowns dropped into the skillet.
Mother and son sit at the baby table eating silently.
Lie in bed reading ‘Goodnight Goodnight Construction Site’
A skillet.
A pat of butter.
Hashbrowns sizzle.
Sitting on the small chairs.
Walk on the street hand in hand. Stop and watch a garbage
truck.
Reading ‘Goodnight Goodnight Construction Site’
Staring. A skillet.
A cup of coffee.
A pat of butter.
The mother’s ratty t-shirt is suddenly a different color, but
otherwise everything is the same. The son’s saggy diaper and
bare chest as he rams trains on the ground. She reaches down
and picks him up and now he has a shirt on.
She looks toward the skillet and now it’s mac-n-cheese in a
small saucepan that she stirs. It’s evening.
She puts her son down on the ground, and scoops the mac-n-
cheese into two bowls. They sit at the baby table, eating.
The mother sips wine from a real wine glass. She and the boy
cheers.
She lies with the boy in her bed.
NIGHTBITCH Locked White Shooting Draft July 30, 2022 7
NIGHTBITCH Green Revisions October 9, 2022 8
INT. BEDROOM - EVENING.7 7
The boy rolls around on the bed. The mother finishes reading
‘Goodnight Goodnight Construction Site’.
MOTHER
Construction site. Turn out the
light. Great work today and now
goodnight.
MOTHER (CONT’D)
Okay, it’s time for the quiet game.
SON
No, I don’t want to do that.
MOTHER
Let’s see who can lie here and be
the quietest. I bet I’m gonna win.
She puts her finger to her lips and then lies motionless and
soundless while he stares at her. There is a moment of quiet.
SON
I’m gonna talk!
She keeps her eyes closed, trying to not say anything.
MOTHER
Shhh. It’s the quiet game. Quiet as
a mouse.
The boy laughs poking her and climbing on her.
They lie in bed, the boy babbling to himself. Suddenly the
mother starts speaking out loud, not to camera, but it’s
still just to herself.
NIGHTBITCH Green Revisions October 9, 2022 8
NIGHTBITCH Green Revisions October 9, 2022 9
MOTHER (CONT’D)
(out loud to herself)
It’s my fault he doesn’t sleep. I
shouldn’t be mad at him. Everyone
said it and I just didn’t listen
because I liked holding him while
he slept on my chest like a little
warm heater. But if I had put him
down drowsy but awake like all the
books said then he would have good
sleep habits for his entire life, I
would always have a clean kitchen
and a good sex life, and everything
would be amazing. So now that I
fucked that up... now what?
The son starts wailing and flailing. The mother just lies
there.
MOTHER (V.O.)
Maybe if I don’t move he won’t see
me.
INT. KITCHEN - ANY MORNING8 8
Skillet. Butter. Hashbrowns. The mother looks around and
doesn’t see the child.
Suddenly the mother hears something and goes to investigate.
INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS9 9
The mother peers into the bathroom and finds her son drinking
from the toilet.
MOTHER
Oh NO!
He looks up startled, but smiling. She can’t help but laugh.
MOTHER (CONT’D)
You’re drinking from the toilet?
(laughing)
Did that seem like a good idea?
People don’t drink from toilet!
Doggies do!
EXT. STREET- ANY AFTERNOON10 10
They walk down the street hand in hand.
NIGHTBITCH Green Revisions October 9, 2022 9
NIGHTBITCH Green Revisions October 9, 2022 10
INT. LIVING ROOM - ANY EVENING11 11
The mother lies on the rug on her stomach, exhausted from the
day. The son is climbing all over her body, standing on her
back, stepping on her head. She barely registers.
SON
Mama! Horsey!
She takes a deep breath and musters her strength. She pushes
up onto all four, and he sits on her back like a horse. She
starts walking around the living room on all fours, giving
her son a ride.
MOTHER
All around the mulberry bush the
something chased the weasel-
The son starts clapping.
MOTHER (CONT’D)
Okay! Hold on.
(then)
OW!
The mother twists around to look back, and the son is holding
on to her back with tiny fists.
SON
Mama fuzzy!
She’s surprised, and tries to look at her lower back but
can’t see.
MOTHER
No I’m not!
INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT12 12
The mother, in her pajamas, locks the door, and tries to
examine her lower back in the mirror. She feels the furry
peach fuzz on her lower back but she can’t get a good angle.
She takes in her image in the mirror. Extreme close up of the
small hairs poking from her upper lip, her temple, her
unibrow. The back of her neck.
MOTHER
Oh goodie. What fresh hell do I
have to look forward to today? New
wrinkles? New grey hair?
NIGHTBITCH Green Revisions October 9, 2022 10
NIGHTBITCH Green Revisions October 9, 2022 11
She pulls back her upper lip and examines her canine teeth,
leaning closer to the mirror. She touches her tooth. It feels
sharp.
MOTHER (CONT’D)
What the fuck?
She takes one last look at herself in the mirror.
INT. BEDROOM - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT13 13
The mother and son rock in the chair while she hums quietly
to him. She is barely able to stay awake as she rocks.
MOTHER (V.O.)
What if I never sleep through the
night ever again?
INT. KITCHEN - AFTERNOON14 14
A small suitcase is in the corner of the room. Dad is home.
Our mother stands by the stove, stirring a pot of lentil
soup, attempting domesticity.
MOTHER
Baby - show daddy how you balance
your trains! He hasn’t seen that.
SON
Ruff! Grrrr.
MOTHER
He usually does it.

HUSBAND
So I really shouldn’t have bothered
to write out that whole report for
him, because they didn’t need it
and didn’t even read it.
MOTHER
Oh how annoying.
The husband takes a sip from his beer.
HUSBAND
It really was. Sometimes I swear
they don’t realize I have a life
and would rather be home with you
guys than typing up reports at 11pm
on a Thursday from my hotel room.
He reaches down and rubs his son’s head.
MOTHER
Well, we had a fine week. We went
to Book Babies.
HUSBAND
I thought you hated Book Babies?
MOTHER
Oh I do. It was an accident, truth
be told, but he loved it.
The cat waddles in, and starts purring around the husband’s
ankles. He pets her.
HUSBAND
You’re still alive, ya ol’ furball?
MOTHER
She is the cat who will never die.
Even though nobody really pays any
attention to her anymore. Baby, no!
Don’t chase the cat.
The son and cat go running into the other room.
MOTHER (CONT’D)
(then)
Speaking of furballs - I’m like...
I don’t know.
HUSBAND
What?
NIGHTBITCH Locked White Shooting Draft July 30, 2022 12
NIGHTBITCH Locked White Shooting Draft July 30, 2022 13
MOTHER
No. I shouldn’t have brought it up.
I’m just having some odd side
effects maybe of perimenopause? I’m
not sure. Weird hair sprouting up?
HUSBAND
You talking about your nipples?
MOTHER
No! Lower back. And kind of my toes
too. I don’t know. I just feel off.
I feel like I have this heightened
sense of smell - kind of like when
I was pregnant. The cat’s butt
smells disgusting to me.
HUSBAND
That’s not just you.
MOTHER
And my teeth seem to be getting
sharper. Look!
He approaches her and looks at her barred teeth, examining
them.
HUSBAND
Oh yeah. Definitely. Your teeth
look so weird. This is real and not
in your head.
She hits him playfully.
HUSBAND (CONT’D)
I’m sorry, but honey you always
think something is wrong with you.
MOTHER
Well, that’s the thing about being
a hypochondriac - one day I will be
right! And then you’ll be sorry.
He smiles at his wife who he truly enjoys, kisses her on the
cheek.
They all continue on with what they’re doing.
INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT15 15
The two parents whisper to not wake their child who is asleep
in their bed.
NIGHTBITCH Locked White Shooting Draft July 30, 2022 13
NIGHTBITCH Goldenrod Revisions November 2, 2022 14
The husband slips on sweats from his drawer, and the mother
brushes her teeth in the adjoining bathroom, wearing a ratty
t-shirt and sports bra.
MOTHER
(loud whisper)
I can’t remember the last time I
washed this shirt. *
HUSBAND
(loud whisper)
I never washed any of my clothes *
for all of college. You’re just *
like a bachelor.
MOTHER
(loud whisper)
I mean, it’s just like... what’s
the point? I always hated hard
pants. I’m giving in to just a soft-
pants lifestyle.
HUSBAND
(loud whisper)
You’re living the dream.
MOTHER
(loud whisper)
I’m the housewife I never wanted to
be! (then)
You know what’s the hardest part?
It’s like I’m on suicide watch and
I can’t look away for even a
second. Or he might stick a fork
into a light socket, or like walk
off a cliff. Why does he want to
kill himself? It’s so much more
mentally exhausting than I
expected.
HUSBAND
(loud whisper)
It’s better than leaving him with
those awful ladies at the awful
daycare, right?
MOTHER
(whisper)
I guess. That was heartbreaking.
He enters the bathroom, closing the door a little too loudly.
NIGHTBITCH Goldenrod Revisions November 2, 2022 14
NIGHTBITCH Locked White Shooting Draft July 30, 2022 15
MOTHER (CONT’D)
(whispering)
If you wake him up I will rip your
throat out.
She spits. The husband ignores this and starts brushing his
own teeth. She sits on the toilet to pee.
HUSBAND
I thought this is what you wanted.
No more long hours at the gallery
and crying while you pumped your
boobs in a bathroom.
MOTHER
I did, I do. But maybe I need to
find a part-time job or something?
So I don’t lose my mind.
The husband starts flossing, while she spaces out on the
toilet.
HUSBAND
It’s just the math doesn’t totally
add up. The likelihood of you
making more than we would have to
pay a sitter-
MOTHER
I know. And there aren’t really
part time gallery jobs. Or part
time nannies.
HUSBAND
Right.
MOTHER
Maybe when he starts school.
HUSBAND
Yeah. You just gotta hold on till
Kindergarten.
MOTHER
Then I think - how dare I complain?
What a gift - to get to be with my
baby all day long. I should be
grateful- on the scale of people
who have things to complain about
I’m at the bottom. I’m just a
fucking privileged white lady who
gets to stay home and make cookies
all day.
NIGHTBITCH Locked White Shooting Draft July 30, 2022 15
NIGHTBITCH Goldenrod Revisions November 2, 2022 16
HUSBAND
Do you make cookies?
MOTHER
Not once.
A shared smile.
HUSBAND
I would kill to get to stay home
with him every day, for what that’s
worth.
The mother glares.
MOTHER
(sharply)
You think that. But I can assure
you, you would not.
He exits leaving her on the toilet.
INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT16 16
The three family members lie in bed, all asleep. The mother
has drifted into a deep sleep, mouth open, drool pooling.
Suddenly the son wakes and starts screaming between the two
of them. The mother rouses reluctantly. She looks to her
husband sleeping soundly. She waits. The son wails. She looks
at her husband asleep, rage building in her eyes. He looks so
content. A soft sleepy music plays on his shot.
Hard cut back to the mother, punk music blaring on her shot,
building, building. From deep in the mother, a “grrrrr” sound
builds in her throat.
Back to the husband, sleeping soundly with his soundtrack
playing.
The son screams.
Punk music blaring, the mother boils over, pushing her
husband hard to wake him.
MOTHER
HEY! His fucking binky! Do you not
hear him?
The husband wakes, totally confused, and she turns her back *
to them to let him figure it out. He fumbles and puts the *
binky back in his son’s mouth, who quiets. Now the husband
lies there awake, and confused.

INT. KITCHEN - MORNING17 17
The Mother is unloading the dishwasher, and the son is lying
on the floor of the living room watching a cartoon. The *
husband enters in his t-shirt and boxers. There’s a small
amount of tension.
HUSBAND
Did you make coffee?
MOTHER
Not yet - will you do it?
He looks toward the coffee pot, slightly unsure of how to use
it.
HUSBAND
Uh... sure. Is it two scoops?
MOTHER
I do three.
He gets the coffee set up, and starts to help her unloading
the dishes, without being asked.
HUSBAND
So, last night... you were kind of
a-
MOTHER
Bitch?
He laughs lightly.
HUSBAND
You said it not me.
MOTHER
(quickly)
Yep. Night bitch. I am Nightbitch.
They both share a laugh. He is utterly relieved. She is less
so. Once again, the mother speaks out loud but nobody can
hear her. It’s like she’s speaking her voice-over, not direct
to camera, but very matter of fact. She does the dishes.
MOTHER (CONT’D)
I sort of said it like that so that
he could see I’m a good sport. I’m
not like uptight, or not able to
poke fun at myself. But once I said
it, I knew the horrible truth.
Nightbitch has always been there.

to herself.

The mother is collapsed on the couch. The son is playing on
the floor in his diaper. The husband enters with a pep in his
step, clapping his hands together.
HUSBAND
What’s next?
MOTHER
Bath time.
The husband looks toward the boy.
HUSBAND
I’ll do it. Let’s go little dude.

INT. CITY BAR- TEN YEARS AGO22 22
Our mother, younger (30) and not a mother yet, and her
boyfriend, not her husband yet, sit huddled at a bar table
lit by candlelight, deep in conversation.
YOUNGER HUSBAND
I want to come to this exhibit.
That’s so incredible that you are
doing that.
YOUNGER MOTHER
Okay you can come. But my art is
weird. You need to be ready. I
don’t know if you totally get what
you’ve gotten yourself into.
YOUNGER HUSBAND
I like weird.
YOUNGER MOTHER
Yeah yeah, you think you do.
He pulls from his bag a small notebook.
YOUNGER HUSBAND
This is my little book of weird....
On the cover is a photograph of a bearded woman with her
breasts out, looking very happy.
YOUNGER HUSBAND (CONT’D)
I took that photo in Prague. Look -
I collect things or take pictures
of things I find interesting.
She flips through the notebook. There’s a condom wrapper with
“I love you” written on it in lipstick.
YOUNGER MOTHER
Was this yours?
YOUNGER HUSBAND
No I found it on the street in
front of some dorms and thought it
was so romantic.

There’s a photo of a cat made out of snow. There’s a photo of
people dressed up in animal costumes with chaps making out
with each other in a very lewd fashion. There are found notes
and little scribblings.
She looks to her future husband and sees his innocent
delight.
YOUNGER HUSBAND (CONT’D)
Isn’t it amazing? Humans are so
strange.
She leans over and kisses him.

HUSBAND
What?
MOTHER
Nothing.
They both stare at each other.
MOTHER (CONT’D)

The husband looks up to her, annoyed in an exhausted way.

It’s just - when you’re gone, I do

She exits.

Make a plan ... draw up a schedule.
Treat it like it’s your job.
Happiness is a choice.
She slaps him in the face very hard. He doesn’t respond.
Back to reality she stands there on the street still holding
her son, no slap has happened.
HUSBAND (CONT’D)
Happiness is a choice.
MOTHER
I’m sure you’re right. I’ll try.
They kiss and he gets in the car. She turns back toward the
house with the boy with a big sigh.
MOTHER (CONT’D)
(to boy)
Let’s have a good day, okay?
INT. KITCHEN - LATER THAT MORNING28 28
The mother is taping large pieces of paper down on the floor.
She has finger paints out and has carefully squirted blobs of
each color onto a plastic plate. She pulls her son’s pj shirt
off, leaving him just in a diaper.
MOTHER
Today we’re going to have an art
day! Doesn’t that sound fun?
She shows him the colors.
MOTHER (CONT’D)
You can put your fingers in, or
your feet!
He looks at her confused so she shows him. Takes a finger and
smears red paint on the paper.

The boy dips his fingers and toes in the paint. He smacks
them on the paint joyfully. He takes his hand and puts a
handprint on the paper.
MOTHER (CONT’D)
Yeah! That’s right.
She bends down next to him to add to the creation, and he
immediately grabs her shirt with his paint filled hands.
MOTHER (CONT’D)
Okay okay. On the paper. The paper,
okay?
The boy stands up, screaming in excitement, dips his hands
again and starts shaking his hands everywhere sprinkling
paint all over the kitchen.
MOTHER (CONT’D)
Isn’t this fun? But on the paper.
He jumps into the paint again and goes running into the
living room leaving foot prints on the wood floor as he goes.
MOTHER (CONT’D)
BABY! NO!
As she starts to follow him, the cat runs through the scene
getting under her feet. The mother slips, grabbing onto a
hanging dishtowel as she falls, and pulls the towel rack off
the wall as she hits the ground on her butt hard.
She lies back on her back in genuine pain.
MOTHER (CONT’D)
uhhhhh fuck.
From the other room you can hear the boy repeating:
SON
fuck. fuck!
INT. KITCHEN - LATER THAT DAY29 29
The mother sprays and scrubs the cabinets for their last
remains of paint splatter. She cries lightly to herself.

MOTHER
(trying to convince
herself)
Happiness is a choice. Happiness is

What’s up with that duck? What’s up
with that duck? UGH! Fuck. Stop!
She scrubs harder, letting the tears flow.
MOTHER (V.O.)
I need to just enjoy these moments
with him. He’s going to grow up and
I will be sad these days are gone.
But I’m lonely. I can’t believe how
alone I feel considering I’m never
actually alone.
She sprays and scrubs and cries.
MOTHER (V.O.)
How can I still have dinner, and
bath and books to get through
before this day is over? What’s up
with that duck? What’s up with that
duck?
She lays back on the ground, defeated, closes her eyes.
She takes a deep breath, and then touches her tailbone which
hurts from her fall and she just lets herself cry. There in
the kitchen, with paint all over the walls, she lays on the
floor and sobs.

She flips on the light, and pulls her sweatpants down enough
to examine her tailbone in the mirror which is red and
throbbing, like a cyst that’s formed at the top of her
buttcrack.

Shit.
She takes a washcloth and warms it in hot water, placing it
on the red bump. It doesn’t help- she winces.
The mother sanitizes a large sewing needle over the flame of
a lighter. She grabs her reading glasses from the table and
takes the needle and scrapes a hole open in the cyst,
screaming out in pain as she does. Blood drips down and the
skin opens, revealing something mussed, and hairy.

INT. LIVING ROOM - THE NEXT MORNING34 34
The son is playing with his toy dog on the ground while the
mom lies on the couch in pain, icing her backside, on a video *
call to her husband. *
HUSBAND (ON PHONE)
Wait, you cut it open?
MOTHER
I had to release the pressure. You

HUSBAND (ON PHONE)
You need to call a doctor- that’s

MOTHER
I haven’t told you the weirdest

HUSBAND (ON PHONE)
What?
MOTHER
It had hair. In the cyst. There was
hair.
HUSBAND (ON PHONE)
Honey- I...
MOTHER
I know. I know. But I’m telling
you... it’s like I have a tail -
you know those babies who are born
with a tail? A fucking-
(then remembering her son)
Sorry, a freakin- tail.
NIGHTBITCH Goldenrod Revisions November 2, 2022 26
NIGHTBITCH Blue Revisions August 30, 2022 27
HUSBAND (ON PHONE)
(in a very condescending
tone)
It’s not a tail. It’s a cyst that
was exacerbated when you fell. And
cysts are known to have hair. It’s
not a weird thing. The weird thing
is that you haven’t taken yourself
to a doctor.
The mother’s face is concerned, she knows he’s right but
she’s reluctant.
MOTHER
(to herself, aloud)
What I can’t tell him is that I
have such a strong urge to wag it.
EXT. PARK - DAY35 35
The son plays on the playground while the mom looks at her
phone searching “werewolves and mothers” and then “women with
tails”. The results are disturbing.
SON
mamamamamamama!
She stays staring at her phone.
MOTHER
One second baby.
He runs up to the slide again. She is staring at her phone,
and then startles when she looks up and there is a shaggy
brown dog right next to her staring at her.
MOTHER (CONT’D)
Oh my god! Where did you come from?
She looks around to see if this dog is somebody’s. She asks
another mother:
MOTHER (CONT’D)
Is she your dog?
The mother shakes her head no. Her son approaches and starts
petting the dog.
MOTHER (CONT’D)
Oh baby- wait.
NIGHTBITCH Blue Revisions August 30, 2022 27
NIGHTBITCH Blue Revisions August 30, 2022 28
But the dog is mild mannered and takes to her son well. A
golden retriever saunters up to her and the boy and the
mother laughs in delight.
MOTHER (CONT’D)
Look at you! You’re so beautiful.
And you smell good. Like fresh
strawberries. Did you just have a
bath?
She pets the golden retriever. And then feels a nudge behind
her and a collie has joined in the petting party.
MOTHER (CONT’D)
Look at them. Hello sweet one.
(then calling out)
Whose dogs are these?
After a few more good pets, the dogs look to something in the
distance and start trotting away. The mother and son look at
each other and start running after them. Running as fast as
they’ve ever run.
They run fast toward the pond, and the dogs are too far away,
and suddenly they’re gone.
MOTHER (CONT’D)
Wait! Come back!
SON
DOGGIES!!
MOTHER
We’re coming with you!
But the dogs are gone. They collapse on the ground panting
from running, laughing and elated, feeling the grass on their
backs. The mother kisses her son on the forehead and they
stay where they are, nuzzled in the grass, feeling the sun.
EXT. SMALL FARM HOUSE - LATE EVENING36 36
Our mother, as a YOUNG GIRL (maybe 9), stands on her porch of
her modest home, looking out into rural farmland. Opera music
blares from a small radio. In the grass, a woman in a light
floral dress is lying motionless, eyes closed, barefoot. The
young girl approaches, slightly concerned.
YOUNG GIRL
Mama?
NIGHTBITCH Blue Revisions August 30, 2022 28
NIGHTBITCH Goldenrod Revisions November 2, 2022 29
Her mother startles from her state, and wipes tears from her

No. I’m not. Go back inside. I’m
okay.
The young girl turns back toward her house.
INT. MODEST MENNONITE CHURCH - SUNDAY MORNING37 37
The young girl and her FATHER, 40s and a working man, sit in
a pew singing along with the chorus, including her mother,
who are singing at the front of the Mennonite church. Her
mother has a beautiful voice. She stands out.
MOTHER (V.O.)
My mother once told me she almost
become a famous singer in Europe,
but she stayed back and had us
instead.
The young girl watches her mother, closely studying her. She
seems so happy as she sings.
INT. STUDIO - LATER THAT DAY38 38
Back to the present, our mother looks through a past
portfolio of her work as an artist. A cut out from a *
newspaper article with a photograph of a large scale *
installation - A pool filled with ocean water- shells, dirty
sand, pieces of garbage. Hanging above the pool from the
ceiling is an intricate light show, projecting light down on
the ocean.
Yelling pierces in from the other room. She quietly puts the
portfolio back in a drawer.
MOTHER
(calling out, not
worried)
I’m coming baby.
She exits and we linger on the walls for a few moments. The
office that hasn’t been used in a long time, with posters
from European art exhibits on the walls, paints in the
corner, carefully arranged paintbrushes on the shelves.

Two large monitors sit on top of the desk, with post-its
stuck to them with little notes scribbled. A large cork board
with a collage of images cut from magazines adorns one wall.
It’s a beautiful inspiration board of disturbing images. A
light layer of dust is on everything.
INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT39 39
The mother and son sleep deeply in their bed. The sounds of
rustling and grunting, snarfing and scratching outside the
window. The mother stirs just a little then suddenly sits up,
alerted. The ominous sounds grow.

The mother retrieves a baseball bat from the closet and heads
toward the front door.

The mother approaches the front door trepidatiously. The

door and slowly steps out.
EXT. PORCH - CONTINUOUS42 42
The mother looks around in awe. The three dogs from the park
plus at least twenty others have all gathered on her front
lawn under a full moon. As she comes outside the dogs sit and
turn toward her, like she’s their leader.
MOTHER
What the-
The Brown dog lifts her head as if to beckon her.
MOTHER (CONT’D)
This is a dream. This can’t be
real. This is a game.
She slowly puts her bat down, drawn inexplicably to the dogs.
Inside her sweatpants we see the faintest indication that her
tail is wagging. She bares her teeth, and sniffs the air.
The dogs are all beautiful and majestic. One calls out and
they all begin howling.
The mother approaches the pack and before she knows it she’s
being surrounded by dogs. At first this feels delightful. The
retriever nudges her, and she pets the dogs.

Then suddenly feels one of them pulling her arm down toward
the ground. She resists.
MOTHER (CONT’D)
No! Don’t.
Another dog pulls at her shirt with her mouth, ripping her t-
shirt. She swats at the dog, pulling her shirt away. She
starts to succumb to the mob, being pulled down, but trying
to get back up, screaming out. She kicks a dog, who rips the
leg of her sweatpants. Another pulls her down and everything
goes black.

Clank. A pat of butter in the skillet. Hashbrowns. But the

I had such a weird dream. You want
to eat on the porch this morning?
Her son nods. He toddles away happily. The front door opens.
MOTHER (CONT’D)
Don’t let the cat out.
Her son enters carrying a dead mouse by the tail.
MOTHER (CONT’D)
Oh baby! NO! Where did you get
that? Yucky yucky.
She takes it from him with a paper towel, carrying him to the
sink to wash his hands. He leads her to the open front door.
She approaches it and gasps.

A pile of dead animals - rabbits, squirrels, mice - has been

The mother gasps, terrified. Her son points at the animals.
SON
Bunny!
They both stare, looking around but the street and lawn are
empty. No sign of another dog. No sign of anyone. It is very
eerie.
INT. GROCERY STORE - DAY46 46
The mother, son riding in the cart, wheels through the large
aisles, a cart filled with piles of red meat, lost in
thought. She is very concerned.
MOTHER
(speaking aloud as she
pushes the cart)
I’m hysterical. I’m hormonal and
hysterical. I’ve always thought of
myself as like... a smart woman who
sometimes got a little upset but
was mostly cool to hang out with.
But not hysterical. But at this
point - I’m hysterical. I need to
get my hormone levels checked.
She picks up a wedge of cheese from the fancy cheese aisle
and smells it.
MOTHER (CONT’D)
Hay, smoke, honey, some fungal
musk. Amazing. Could I always smell
like this and I just wasn’t paying
attention? Or... Or.
She throws the cheese in the cart. She throws a bunch of
carrots and some celery into her cart.
MOTHER (CONT’D)
Yes, vegetables are very civilized.
Dogs wouldn’t buy vegetables.
She shakes her head at her own thoughts making faces at her
son. So silly. Looking around at the other mothers with kids
in carts, some with two or three. She gives a faint smile to
one of them who doesn’t engage.

The mother keeps shopping when suddenly from behind her,
SALLY, 30 cute and well rested, appears all giddy with a hug.

She throws the box into her cart.

Sally looks on surprised as the mother speaks as openly and
honestly as she ever has and just does not stop talking.
MOTHER (CONT’D)
I feel as though societal norms,
gender expectations, and plain old
biology have forced me to become
this person who I don’t recognize.
I am angry all the time - like all
the time. I would one day like to
direct my own artwork toward a
critique of these modern-day
systems which articulates all this
but my brain no longer functions as
it did before the baby and I’m just
really dumb now. I am deeply afraid
I will never be smart or happy or
thin again. Oh and I’m pretty sure
I’m turning into a dog. So.
A beat. We back up in time.

meat. He takes it in his hand and barks playfully. She starts
chasing him.
She chases him throughout the house, growling and barking the
whole time. She finally tackles him down to the rug and
starts snarfing at his stomach and wrestling him, flinging
his body this way and that. He loves every moment of this.
She does too.
They eat their meat on the rug, growling and barking at each
other as they do. Suddenly she remembers the skillet and
rushes to turn off the stove.

She eyes the boy with a bit of a librarian’s contempt.

1978.

Thank you, Norma.
Norma eyes her son, wearily.

The mother hustles out of there, grabbing her son on the way.

The mother is settled into the sofa, nearby the box of her
grandmother’s belongings still strewn about. She opens the
Field Guide book.
MOTHER (V.O.)
(reading)
My introduction to this topic came
about serendipitously. I was
interested in the ways that
womanhood manifests on a mythical
level. Particularly the experience
of motherhood and how this
complicates, deepens, or denies
womanhood...
The mother is taken aback. She looks at the end of the book
and reads the author biography briefly.
She skeptically opens to a chapter titled “The Bird Women of
Peru”.
NIGHTBITCH Pink Revisions September 6, 2022 38
NIGHTBITCH Pink Revisions September 6, 2022 39
MOTHER (V.O.)
(reading)
The bird women of Peru lived in the
tall, leafy boughs of the
rainforest where they constructed
intricate and breathtaking nests
from sticks and reeds.
The mother looks at a photograph of an orb like nest high up
in a tree that looks like it should be on an inspiration
board for Design Within Reach’s catalogue.
MOTHER (V.O.)
(still reading)
The story I had heard before
entering Peru was that The Bird
Women were not born as such but
rather sprouted feathers and beaks
in their sixties. But only if they
had had children who had grown.
People in small Peruvian villages
often explained the disappearance
of older women, with no offspring
to care for, as them giving in to
“the calling of the birds”. The
Bird Women spent the later parts of
their lives flitting from tree to
tree producing the loveliest calls
and learning to fly.
The mother’s eyes begin to close as she reads.

Blackness. A sharp inhale.
Against the pale sky, the silhouette of a tree top becomes
visible, with branches swaying in the wind. The mother’s
face, deep in meditation as she sways in the tree, sitting
atop a branch.
A beautiful bird song calls out from somewhere. The mother
opens her mouth and answers the call with a similar bird
song. She inhales and suddenly falls backward.
The Mother tumbles through space, tree limbs whizzing by her.
She is content and peaceful as she falls, almost like Winnie
the Pooh gently bouncing down the honey tree. She somersaults
in the air and it turns into a dance of sorts, the leaves and
tree branches providing the backdrop for her descent.

The mother and son are playing with a ball on the grass.
Suddenly the mother spots a squirrel. The mother stops,
alert.
MOTHER
Baby! Squirrel! Let’s get it.
The two take off sprinting after the squirrel barking and
snarfing as they go. They arrive at the bottom of the tree,
where the squirrel escapes and they scratch at the bark.
The mother turns her attention to the ball they left behind.
She grabs her son’s hand and they take off running toward the
ball. When they descend on it they pile on top of the ball,
rolling around on the grass playfully, growling and barking
as they do.
In the sunlight the mother looks at her beautiful son, and
his perfect little face. She touches his face and then picks
him up, swinging him around. He giggles in delight.
MOTHER (V.O.)
Maybe it’s really this simple. It
just instinct. We’re animals. He’s

The mother and son walk toward the self-serve hot bar. The
mother takes a cardboard container and starts piling on
meatloaf, chicken fingers, and mac and cheese.
MOTHER
(to her son)
I’ve never felt this hungry in my
life. Ravenous is the word.
Ravenous, baby.
She just keeps going back to the meatloaf and adding more.
Smelling it and salivating as she does. She takes her heavy
container to the check out.
The woman behind the counter puts her container on the scale

Next she turns her attention to her meatloaf. She takes her
eco-plastic silverware and attempts to cut the meatloaf, but
the knife immediately breaks - she tosses it aside. She uses
the fork to try to cut a bite but it’s just not working. She
ditches that too. She grabs the meatloaf with her hands,
ripping a piece off and shoving it into her mouth. It’s
delicious. She closes her eyes, feeling the meat in her
mouth, piling in another bite and then another. Enjoying
every chew. She leans down to smell her meal even more, and
without thinking starts eating right out of the container.
The boy looks on amused and then bends down and starts eating
his food in the same manner. Like two dogs eating out of
their bowls.
The two of them scarf everything they can - in a fugue state
of sorts. The mother looks at her son and ruffs like a dog.
He barks back. She sits up, food covering her entire face to
realize everyone is watching her - the moms, the kids, the
businessmen. One such businessman, alone eating at the next
table makes eye contact with her.
MAN
Hungry?
He nods to her, and she wipes her face, suddenly aware of
where she is. She turns to her son.
MOTHER
(covering her tracks)
We’re doggies, right?
Her son nods and barks. She is quietly so embarrassed.
MOTHER (V.O.)
It’s just a game. Doggy games. I’m
just a good mother playing with my
son. Everyone can see that.
The son goes back to eating and the mother takes a sip of her
water, self-consciously. Just then Norma, beautiful with her
silver hair down her back, who is passing their table, stops
and puts her hand on the mother’s shoulder.
NORMA
What fun it is to have a boy,
right?
The mother nods and smiles, caught off guard seeing Norma out
of the library.
MOTHER
Oh! Norma! It’s you.

NORMA
And what a mother you are. What a
wonderful mother. To have such fun
with your child. I remember the
days.
MOTHER
(genuinely touched)
Oh. Thank you!
NORMA
We used to play dogs too. My son
and I. It was so fun and he just
loved it.
(then to the boy)
ERRRRR.
She bares her teeth at the boy who giggles. She wags her head
back and forth and laughs a hearty and genuine laugh.
MOTHER
You did? I didn’t know you had
kids.
Norma pats her on the shoulder again and walks on
disappearing down the street. The mother looks on longingly.
MOTHER (CONT’D)
(calling after her
although nobody responds)
Oh please don’t go, Norma. Can you
tell me what your relationship with
your son is like now? Did you work
when he was little?
(Calling louder)
Did you make the right choices?
What would you have done
differently? Can you please tell me
the secrets? Tell me your secrets!
Of course Norma is gone and our mother is left alone with her
son.
INT. STUDIO - NIGHT63 63
The mother is looking through the Field Guide book again.

MOTHER (V.O.)
She is the mother to all clawed
creatures.
She flips the pages and finds a sketch of Chimera.
MOTHER (V.O.)
In Greek Mythology, we can point to
Chimera, referenced in Theogony,
and Homer’s The Illiad. A
lion/goat/serpent triad of a beast,
definitely female, who breathes
fire, and terrorizes the people of
Lycia. What is pertinent to my
study, was that Chimera embodied
all things domestic and motherly -
a goat who nurses young and cares
for the homefront - and
simultaneously possesses the
qualities of a beast - sharp teeth
and the ability to light the world
on fire.
The mother closes the book, it is hitting a little close to
home. She turns her attention toward the art hanging on the
walls, and starts to pull out her old supplies.
MOTHER (V.O.)
If my mother were still alive I
would have some serious questions
for her.
She touches some paint brushes, crusted over with dried
paint.
MOTHER (V.O.)
I’d ask her if she ever hated my
father? How did she deal with the
anger? The resentment for all that
she didn’t do? And all he got to do
with his life?

She looks toward her artwork hanging on the walls.
MOTHER (V.O.)
I’d ask her if her body ever
returned to normal? Or her mind?
I’d ask her if she ever regretted
becoming a mother? But I can’t ask
her that. I’d give anything to be
able to ask her.
EXT. PORCH - EVENING64 64
The mother and son wait on the porch. The mother is looking
through the Field Guide book again, while the boy looks
through his own book. Just then her husband’s Uber pulls up. *
He gets out of the back, and the son runs up and greets him.
The mother waits on the porch smiling dimly.
INT. BATHROOM - LATER65 65
The mother comes into the bathroom. She closes the door
behind her, the sound of her son and husband still audible in
the other room. What a luxury.
She turns the water on in the shower. She peels off her
shirt, and catches her reflection in the mirror in her sports
bra. She looks down to examine her stomach: the tiny hairs
around her bellybutton, the wrinkle above her waist. And then
she notices: Six small pink raised dots have appeared on her
torso. They all line up below her breasts. She looks at
herself in the mirror in disbelief and awe.
She twists one of the new formed nipples between her fingers,
scared and also weirdly excited.
INT. SHOWER - MOMENTS LATER66 66
She lathers her hair with shampoo, enjoying this moment of
peace with the water rushing over her. Just then her husband
barges into the bathroom, accusatorially:
HUSBAND

HUSBAND
We have twenty pounds of raw meat,
but no milk.
She can hear her son screaming from the other room. Her
husband leaves to tend to him, leaving the door open.
MOTHER
(calling out)
Can you please close the door?
The screaming gets worse as she rinses her hair. The husband
returns holding an empty sippy cup.
HUSBAND
How can we be out of milk?
MOTHER
Because he drank it.
HUSBAND
But did you know?
MOTHER
Did I know?
She squeezes out some conditioner into her hand.
HUSBAND
Did you know we were out?
MOTHER
I don’t know.
HUSBAND
What does that mean?
The mother takes a deep breath then goes in hard.
MOTHER
This is the first shower I have had
this week. I’ve been to the
supermarket three times, but I
haven’t gotten to wash my body in
at least four days. So clearly I
didn’t realize that we were out of
milk or I would have gotten some.

feeling this one is going to be a
doozy!
She goes back to washing her hair. He is taken aback and
walks out of the bathroom, closing the door behind him. She
smiles in the shower, a small victory. She looks down at her
feet and blood is drooling down her leg, pooling at the
drain.
The mother lets out a guttural grunt at the sight - half roar
half groan.
INT. BEDROOM - THAT NIGHT67 67
The mother lies with the son trying to put him to sleep
finishing Goodnight Goodnight Construction Site, curling her
body in pain next to him in the bed, with a hot water bottle
on her belly.
MOTHER
Okay, that’s the end of the book. I

She stares at him, seething, for a moment, without him
realizing. A low growl builds within her. Her eyes flash red
beneath the surface.
HUSBAND
(to himself re: video
game)
No, no no. Go-
Suddenly the mother lunges, arms up in attack mode, eyes red,
screeching toward her husband to kill him and when she’s mid-
air:
The husband sees her standing by the door, watching him.
HUSBAND (CONT’D)
He out?
MOTHER
No. It’s your turn.
HUSBAND
What? He doesn’t want me.
MOTHER
I don’t care that he doesn’t want
you. I have been doing night nights
every night of every day for two
hundred years and they are fucking
killing me. You have to do night
night. IT’S YOUR NIGHT NIGHT TURN!
He looks at her surprised, and gets up realizing she’s
serious.
HUSBAND
Okay. But for the record I really
don’t like the term “night night”.
She growls at him as he exits the room, and plops on the
couch to watch some stupid tv. The cat jumps up on the couch
to lie with her, and starts rubbing on her. She pushes the
cat off the couch, a little too hard.
MOTHER
Nooooo.
Then feels guilty.
MOTHER (CONT’D)

I just... don’t want one more thing
needing me or touching me.

She lies back on the couch, in agony, but having spoken her

paw marks are still on the wood floor.
INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT70 70
The mother and husband sit next to each other watching tv,
she has the hot water bottle still on her midsection. He rubs
her foot a little.
HUSBAND
You wanna...?
He raises his eyebrows.
MOTHER
(immediately)
God, no.
He pulls his hand away from her foot, offended.
MOTHER (CONT’D)
I didn’t mean that. I just meant -
HUSBAND
Uh huh. Pretty harsh.
MOTHER
I’m sorry, I’m just in so much
fucking pain, you have no idea.
This softens him.
HUSBAND
Oh, gotcha. Sorry.
He rubs her feet a little bit more and they keep watching tv.
MOTHER
Also I have eight nipples now and
fear you’d be repulsed.
She lets her eyes dart to her husband, who hasn’t heard her.

INT./EXT. DOG SEQUENCE72 72
The mother and son at the park, barking and running. Being
dogs.
Eating dinner on the porch: mac n’ cheese out of dog bowls,
no spoons, laughing as they plunge their faces into the
bowls.
The mother walking down the street on all fours. Smiling and
barking at neighbors watering their lawns. One such NEIGHBOR,
an older white man with a perfectly manicured lawn with a
small sign that has an image of a dog pooping with a red
circle around it and a line through it, is disgusted. The
mother just smiles wider.
A big bubble bath. The mother sits at the edge of the bath
which is filled with a comical amount of bubbles. The mother
and son throw the bubbles in the air. The mother puts some on
her face as a beard. The son giggles. She growls like a dog
and pretends to eat the bubbles.
INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT73 73
The mother and son enter the room, the boy dressed in
pajamas.
MOTHER
It’s under the bed! You wanna see
what I got you?
He jumps up and down in excited anticipation.
The mother pulls out an extra large plush dog bed from under
the bed.
MOTHER (CONT’D)
Now baby. Doggies go to night night
in their beds right?
He nods, a little skeptically.
MOTHER (CONT’D)
And do doggies use binkies? Noooo.
He shakes his head. She places the bed in the corner, and her
son climbs onto it. She licks his head and ear
affectionately, pulls a small blanket over him and tucks him
in.
MOTHER (CONT’D)
Night night doggie.

She watches in amazement as her son stays in the bed.
INT. BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT74 74
The mother is stretched out over the entire bed enjoying her
sleep while the boy sleeps soundly in his doggie bed.
Suddenly in her sleep her leg starts to twitch. Then it
kicks, again and again. Just like a sleeping dog.
INT./EXT. CAR - LIBRARY PARKING LOT - MORNING75 75
The mother, with her son in his carseat, swings the car into
a spot in the parking lot, blasting the song “Dare to Be
Stupid” by Weird Al. The windows are down so all the other
parents can hear this mom singing along loudly:
MOTHER
(singing)
Dare to be stupid, dare to be
stupid. What did I say? Dare to be
stupid. Tell me, what did I say?
Dare to be stupid. It’s alright.
Dare to be stupid. We can be stupid
all night.
She doesn’t even notice the looks she’s getting, just
finishes the verse before turning off the car.
INT. LIBRARY - MORNING76 76
The mother, hair disheveled but down, saunters past Norma who
is quietly working behind the desk.
MOTHER
NORMA! Look baby, it’s Norma.

Her son has on a collar with dog tags. And she doesn’t mind.
Jen spots her and waves.
JEN

Her son barks. The mother doesn’t flinch.
MOTHER (CONT’D)
He’s a dog today.
Everyone takes their seats with their children. The leader
starts a peppy round of Wheels on the Bus. Much to everyone’s
surprise our mother sings along at full voice. She’s not the
best singer in the room, but she just doesn’t give a fuck.

The caregivers and children mill about after the class.
Miriam, Liz and Jen surround our mother who is enjoying the
attention. The kids play in the background.
LIZ
I’m loving your hair. It’s so wild.

Oh thanks. I guess that’s what

Liz touches her growing belly.
LIZ
I can’t hike very far these days.
JEN
Yeah, how are you feeling? Can I?
She motions to touching Liz’s belly, who nods. They all lean
in to touch her belly, including Mother. As the Mother gets
close to Jen, she takes a deep sniff of her hair.
MOTHER
Strawberry shampoo.
JEN
Oh. What was that?

Sorry. My sense of smell is so

That is so right on. We don’t.
Nobody tells you that you won’t
ever get to jump on a trampoline
again.
They all giggle, then the mother takes it too far:
MOTHER
Not to mention that the whole
concept of motherhood that we are
sold is such bullshit - you’re
going to be expected to figure this
whole thing out alone without any
village to speak of, you’re going
to get no maternal benefits from
the government, you’re going to be
mocked in popular culture, and
there’s basically a billion dollar
industry that’s designing products
made to make you feel like you’re a
terrible mother!
(then, to Liz who is
shocked)
But seriously, congratulations.
Everyone waits to see how Liz will respond.
LIZ
I mean, you’re totally right. My
sister who lives in Berlin now got
two years paid maternity leave.
They all respond with their understandable frustration.
LIZ (CONT’D)
I can’t believe I’m going to go

loves telling the story of my first
birth. And how the doctor turned to
me and said “it’s time to get that
baby out” and a vein started
popping in my forehead and I turned
into like a wild animal. I know he
was impressed.
MOTHER
(a little light goes off
for her)
A wild animal?
The mother starts to notice the features of Jen, Miriam and
Liz - how they twitch their noses, and the droop of their
mouths.
JEN
Oh my god yes. My husband says the
same thing. That the sounds coming
out of me were pure animal. He
almost passed out. But he’s not
good with blood.
MOTHER
Do you ever feel like the big
secret is that we are gods?
The other three moms turn to her.
JEN
What?
MOTHER
Mothers. We fucking create life. We
make life.
MIRIAM
WHOAAAA. You are blowing my

It’s just a game. We play dogs. And
he loves it!
HUSBAND
Okay. And he’s eating out of a dog

He looks to two silver dog bowls in the drying rack.
MOTHER
Sometimes. Yes. Sometimes we eat
out of perfectly new, never-been-

She smiles knowing how silly this sounds.
HUSBAND
And he has a collar?

His wife is happy. But something is weird.

HUSBAND

She turns and goes to him.
MOTHER
But I haven’t had to lie with him

For the mother - especially the
mother of infants and very small
children - occupies that peculiar
space of in-between - not fully
human nor fully animal - and it is
in this liminal otherworld where we
find many of the most compelling
magical women.
A dog howls somewhere far away. She sits up. Driven by
something within her, something she read. She walks out of
the room in her pajamas.
INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS82 82
The mother walks toward the front door, opening it and
walking out without closing it into the night as though in a
trance.
EXT. FRONT YARD - NIGHT83 83
The mother goes to a dark patch of dirt in the corner of the
yard and starts rolling around in it, pushing her nose deep
into the dirt, scratching her back in satisfying ways against
the cold ground. She grabs a pile of mud and smears it across
her chin and neck. Stretching her nose forward and sniffing
the air. Her face subtly elongates becoming more snout-like
as she sniffs.
The mother’s POV: The moonlight shines on the tree tops. The
trill from night birds reverberates the air, which is almost
visible like water rippling in the sky. Critters move on the
grass and pull her attention. Her senses are awake.
She starts digging in the dirt with her hands and feet,
clawing at the earth, a tail sprouting from her backside
between her coccyx. As she paws at the earth, her legs seem
to bulge, becoming more muscular, and hind-leg-like with fur
slowly covering everything. Her feet morph into large paws.
She rips off her shirt revealing a hairy trunk of her body,
eight nipples and strong front paws. With each scratch and
dig in the dirt, her body transforms more fully into a large
wolf-like dog, silver and menacing - a large shadow in the
corner of the yard.
The fully formed dog puffs its chest out, smelling the air
and dashes across the yard leaping over the fence gracefully.

The mother laughs. A familiar game. She reaches over and pets
her head.
MOTHER
(Also pleasant)
Maybe a chicken hawk will swoop
down and grab her with its talons
while she’s up there.
The husband nods approvingly.
MOTHER (CONT’D)
(like a fairytale)
Then take her up into the sky and
drop her from a great height into a
deep quarry where heaving mining
equipment with caterpillar treads
will repeatedly run over her broken
corpse.
HUSBAND
Wow. Specific.
MOTHER
Thanks.

INT. NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM - LATER THAT DAY91 91
The husband pushes the son in a stroller while the mom trails
next to them.
HUSBAND
Which way? Mammals?
MOTHER
Sure!
From behind them comes Jen, pushing her personal double
stroller, each kid with a dinosaur hat on, and big smiles.
JEN
I can’t believe it! Here you are!
MOTHER
Jen! Wow - hi. It’s weird to see
you in the wild - out of context.
Both mothers are bashful, happy to see each other but trying
to not come on too strong.
JEN
(sotto - not noticing the
husband)
I’ve been thinking about that
conversation in the library non-
stop.
MOTHER
You have?
JEN
Yes. That thing you said about how
mothers are mocked in popular
culture -
She realizes that the mother’s husband is looking on.
JEN (CONT’D)
Sorry - I’m Jen. It’s nice to meet
you.
HUSBAND
Hi, Jen.
JEN
Your wife is amazing. We’re all
trying to get her in our crew!
The husband looks at his wife with a small smirk.

Oh yeah?
The mother shrugs.
MOTHER
I’m a catch.
JEN
(to the mother)
Are you coming to baby yoga or tyke
hike this week?
MOTHER
Another time. I promise.
JEN
Oh poo. Next time. Come on, kiddos!
Let’s go see the dinosaur bones!
ROWRRRRR!
Her babies roar back. The mother looks on a bit surprised at
the ferocity of Jen’s roar. Something is up with her.
HUSBAND
What was that about?
MOTHER
Nothing. She’s a new friend.
He looks on confused.
HUSBAND
She is?
NIGHTBITCH Yellow Revisions September 26, 2022 63A
NIGHTBITCH Yellow Revisions September 26, 2022 64
The mother cozies up next to her husband as they walk.
MOTHER
I think I’m having a bit of a
realization. Maybe it’s all the
dead animals everywhere I look-
makes you think about your
mortality.
HUSBAND
What’s the realization?
MOTHER
I don’t think I’m an artist
anymore.
As she says it her voice catches in her throat.
MOTHER (CONT’D)
(surprised by the
emotion)
It’s, like, a hard thing to admit I
guess. I don’t know why I’m getting
upset about it. I’m not upset.
She takes a breath, trying to convince herself. The husband
looks at her as they walk, a little concerned.
HUSBAND
No, you don’t seem upset at all.
They stop and sit on a bench, and he puts his arm around her,
surrounded by the dioramas of deceased animals.
MOTHER
Because... I have this running list
of all the things I’m not doing
every day - all the ways I’m
falling behind as an artist. And I
feel like if I could just focus on
what I AM doing I would be much
happier.
HUSBAND
I could see that.
NIGHTBITCH Yellow Revisions September 26, 2022 64
NIGHTBITCH Locked White Shooting Draft July 30, 2022 65
MOTHER
I am just a mom now. I should focus
on being the best mom I can be -
enjoying these moments with him,
because this isn’t going to last.
He’s growing up so fast.
She’s tearing up a the thought.
HUSBAND
That’s true.
MOTHER
And being an artist is such a
silly, self-absorbed thing to be.
It’s truly an embarrassing job to
say out loud. What am I, six?
Picking between an artist or a
princess?
The husband laughs kindly.
MOTHER (CONT’D)
I think there’s sort of a relief in
just letting it all go, you know?
And being in this moment, with him.
And letting that be my goal for
now.
HUSBAND
Okay. If that’s what you want.
He isn’t sure he believes her, but he kisses her on her head.
MOTHER
That’s what I want.
The mother nods, convincingly, and collapses into her
husband’s embrace.
INT. LIVING ROOM - THAT NIGHT92 92
The mother and her husband have quiet but passionate sex on
the couch, doggie-style.
MOTHER
(loud whisper)
Bite my neck.
HUSBAND

NIGHTBITCH Locked White Shooting Draft July 30, 2022 66
MOTHER
Bite my neck, hard.
He does. She howls out a little in pleasure.
INT. BEDROOM - THAT NIGHT93 93
The mother and husband lie in bed, the son asleep in his
doggie bed. The husband snores while the mother stares up at
the ceiling, thinking.
MOTHER (V.O.)
Maybe that’s what all mothers
secretly need. One night of
violence to get it out of our
systems. I do feel better now.
Lighter. And it’s done. I’m me
again.
She rolls over to contentedly go to sleep.
CUT TO:
Flashes from the park. Panting. Digging. The POV of a dog
seeing the flesh of a newly killed rabbit. Growling, and
teeth.
Heart pounding. Frantic digging. Howling.
CUT BACK TO:
The mother wakes covered in flop sweat, unsure where she is.
INT. KITCHEN - EARLY MORNING94 94
The husband comes in, in sweats, to find the mother already
mid -project on the table. She is making a large colorful
chart for the week, complete with little drawings
accompanying each day. The sounds of a story podcast audible
from the living room.
MOTHER
I’m taking your advice. I’m making
a plan for the week. A schedule for
us.
The husband groggily goes for coffee.
HUSBAND
Oh. Good.

Thursday is free day and Friday is

HUSBAND
Wow. Okay.
MOTHER
I mean, if I’m gonna do it, I
should just commit. Right?
HUSBAND
Right.
MOTHER
And you remember that I said I
would meet up with my grad school
friends in the city tonight, right?
HUSBAND
Yes. I’m babysitting.
MOTHER
It’s not babysitting when it’s your
own kid.
HUSBAND
Whatever. You know what I mean. I’m
on bedtime duty. And you are going
to go have a grown up dinner.
MOTHER
Yep. At 9 pm. Four hours later than
I usually eat.
INT. KITCHEN - EVENING95 95
The mother comes in to find the husband and son playing
trains on the ground. She’s dressed very cooly - good jeans
that hurt her stomach, and a nice blouse with a real bra and
a purse.
HUSBAND
Yowsa. You look nice.
MOTHER
Maybe I shouldn’t go. Are you guys
going to be alright?

HUSBAND
We got this. We’re good, right
little dude?
The son seems to realize in this moment what’s happening and
runs to his mom’s leg screeching:
SON
Mamamamamamamamama!
Just then the cat starts mrowling from the laundry room and
dragging her butt as she walks past the hallway.
HUSBAND
What is that?
MOTHER
Oh god, she does that when she has
a shit stuck on her butt. This-
(she mouthes the f-word) fucking
cat. Someone has to wash her.
The husband looks at her with pleading eyes.
HUSBAND
Not it.
MOTHER
Come on! I can’t. I never get to go
out.
The husband tries to pull the son from his mother’s leg.
HUSBAND
I’ll take care of him, if you’ll
take care of the cat.
INT. BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER96 96
The mother is leaning over the tub with rubber gloves on
sudsing the backside of the cat, mumbling to herself.

Nobody in this fucking family can
clean their own butts.
From the other room the sound of her screaming son pierces
through and she winces.

MOTHER (V.O.)
I used to do this. Go out and see
people. Talk about grown up things.
I can do this.
Her stomach growls. She touches it instinctively.
INT. HIP CITY RESTAURANT - NIGHT100 100
The Mother walks in to find seven of her grad-school friends
already crowding around their beautiful table in the crowded
restaurant. Some are standing with their cocktails, some are
seated lost in heated conversation. The mother enters without
anyone noticing. She has to tap one of her friends, NAYA, 40
but doesn’t look it and intimidatingly cool, on the shoulder,
who wheels around.
NAYA
You made it!
(then to everyone)
Look who traveled into the big
city!
Everyone laughs and exchange hugs and hellos. The mother is
the least hip of the group by a lot.
NIGHTBITCH Goldenrod Revisions November 2, 2022 69
NIGHTBITCH Blue Revisions August 30, 2022 70
INT. HIP CITY RESTAURANT - LATER101 101
Everyone is seated now at the table and the mother’s end of
the table is engaged in conversation with each other, menus
in front of them, cocktails and wine in hand. Naya, LEMUEL,
40 gay and gorgeous, the mother, and FREIDA, 45 with an
intense angry energy. Nobody touches the bread, except the
mother, who is starving and digs in. She watches as the
friends talk, like a ping pong match.
FREIDA
It’s got like an ironic wink to it.
LEMUEL
I didn’t get that. I feel like you
have to come from a certain
background to feel that irony.
MOTHER
Right.
Nobody registers the mother who is trying to engage.
FREIDA
You know work that is examining
social media - like my piece- is
tricky. We’ve lost some
objectivity.
MOTHER
(trying to be part of the
conversation)
Uh huh.
FREIDA
I’m working on a video piece about
one woman’s day, taken over 24
hours side by side with an actress
who is acting out that same day in
that very same space. Masturbating,
shitting. All of it.
LEMUEL
But how will you know which woman
is the woman.
FREIDA
Exactly. That’s the genius of it.
It’s a meditation on our culture
right now, cam girls- what it is to
be watched. Is anyone NOT watched?
MOTHER
Wow. Sounds interesting.
NIGHTBITCH Blue Revisions August 30, 2022 70
NIGHTBITCH Locked White Shooting Draft July 30, 2022 71
Finally both Freida and Lemuel look to the mother sharply.
FREIDA
Are you working on anything?
MOTHER
Me? Um. No. I’m not working on
anything. Nope.
Just then the SERVER, 20s male model good looks, comes up to
take their order.
SERVER
We have a beautiful seabass tonight
served in a white wine reduction,
as well as a homemade cavatelli
with chantrelles and fiddlehead
ferns.
Everyone ‘mmm’s’ and ‘ahh’s’. The mother laughs to herself
and Naya looks at her questioningly.
NAYA
What’s funny?
MOTHER
Oh, my kid and I have this joke
about fiddlehead ferns.
She laughs to herself.
MOTHER (CONT’D)
It’s like - we call them FEEEDLE
DEE DEE ferns.
She looks around at everyone and realizes this isn’t going
over the way she expected.
MOTHER (V.O.)
Stop talking! Abort. Abort.
But for some reason instead of stopping she keeps talking,
just more self-consciously.
MOTHER
You probably have to be there. He
has this little two year old
accent. It’s like a lisp. ‘feeeedle
dee dee’.
The server stares. The table stares. After a beat Lemuel
chimes in.

The mother looks down, sound resumes, as everyone continues
to order. When the server gets to her she looks up,
sheepishly.
MOTHER
The kale salad please.
SERVER
What?
MOTHER
The Kale salad?
SERVER
What?
MOTHER
I SAID THE KALE SALAD!
SERVER
No worries.
MOTHER
AND A MANHATTAN! Please.
He nods and writes this down. She grabs for another piece of
bread, shoving it in her mouth, while talking.
MOTHER (CONT’D)
So, Naya, how’s Liliana? What is
she six now?
NAYA
Yes she’s six. She’s amazing. She’s
in first grade at a music academy.
She is really getting into the
cello now, as well as the violin.
It’s just beautiful to see her
blossom, you know?
MOTHER
Wow! Is it ever hard for you to
balance with your work? Like
motherhood and art? How’s that all
going?
NAYA
Not really. I mean, listen, thank
god for Kristy. I couldn’t do it
without my nanny. Of course.

mom because I have my work, I

The mother looks like she may cry, but instead goes for
another bite of bread.
MOTHER
Uh huh.
Suddenly, Naya yells down to the other end of the table.
NAYA
Oh Freida! Your application for the
founders grant - did you do it?
FREIDA
Barely! I turned it in at like two
am. I’m such a fucking idiot. You?
NAYA
Oh I turned it in weeks ago. Now we
wait.
The mother swallows and starts speaking to herself almost,
half joking.
MOTHER
I didn’t get my application in yet.
What am I going to do?
She takes a sip of her drink, kind of loopy and jokey.
MOTHER (CONT’D)
I’m sure they’re wondering where my
application is.
Nobody hears her.
SERVER
(totally nonchalant)
Big Kale for you, Ma’am.
He places down a comically large bowl of kale in front of the
mother, and gives Lemuel his beautiful pasta.
MOTHER
I hate it when they call me Ma’am.
She smiles, but nobody is paying attention to her. The mother
starts eating the endless kale while the other people at her
table continue to talk but their words have lost all meaning.
There is a circus-like quality creeping in.
NAYA (CONT’D)

It’s more of a meditation on -

Let’s call a spade a spade - the
show was the most important
artistic event of our lifetime.
They all nod in agreement. The mother takes a bite of kale
and chews, chews, chews, the sound of the restaurant fading
out and the sounds of a meadow chiming in.
MOTHER (V.O.)
I’m a cow. I’m a zen cow in a
soothing green field.
The server drops her manhattan off at the table.
MOTHER
Oh could I-
He walks away totally ignoring her. She takes a large guzzle
of her manhattan. And then burps like something wants to come
up. All the sound in the restaurant has cut out now. Everyone
is talking but there is no sound. The mother is in her own
world.
MOTHER (CONT’D)
Oop. This kale.
(then)
It’s just pushing it down further:
all my rage and disappointment. I
thought I had digested it. But it’s
still down there.
She massages her midsection -
MOTHER (CONT’D)
Burning a hole in me. And the woman
I used to be - the talented and
plucky young woman with big ideas-
She rubs her belly.

She’s down there also. In my

her time. Or maybe she’s dead.
Suffocated.
She looks around. Looking around at the beautiful restaurant.
Nobody paying attention to her.
MOTHER (CONT’D)
And here I am. Up here. In the
beautiful lighting of this
beautiful fucking restaurant. Just
a middle aged saggy mom without a
single intelligent comment to add
to the conversation. Insignificant.
Oh.
As she says it, it feels so real. Her friends voices fade
back in.
FREIDA
Did you make it to the Simiac
exhibit at the AFA gallery?
NAYA
Have you been to Jermaine’s
installation at the Frick?
LEMUEL
I’m dying to get to the nighttime
exhibit at the Rubin!
She takes another enormous bite of kale.
One of her friends turns her chair toward the other, blocking
the mother out of the conversation - everyone is talking to
someone at the table except her.
MOTHER
Insignificant. Oh, this kale is not
sitting well.
She burps. Maybe she will throw up?
MOTHER (CONT’D)
Oh no. Here it comes.
She leans down to grab her purse from the ground, and as she
stands back up she knocks the table, clattering the
silverware and knocking over a glass of water, and suddenly
everyone is aware of the mother again.

MOTHER
(yelling to nobody and
everyone)
I could crush a walnut with my
vagina!
Everyone in the restaurant is turning to stare.
MOTHER (CONT’D)
What’re you looking at?
She reaches over and grabs a half-eaten burger from a nearby
table, whose recipient, a young woman on a date, screams. The
mother takes an enormous bite as she grabs her bag and
lumbers toward the door, leaving a corridor of stares in her
wake, and taking the burger with her.

Nightbitch runs through the field in the yard of the small

The mother pours her coffee, sipping it slowly, thinking of
how to respond.

Okay, fine - I got a little drunk.
It was really weird seeing all

I drank my dinner and missed the *

HUSBAND
Why did it make you feel like shit?

mean, I know I am. But they think
it’s pathetic and it made me feel
pathetic.

They don’t have any clue. They
don’t have kids. They don’t know
what they’re missing.

He exits, leaving her watching after him, knowing he’s right.

Outside the window, her husband gets into an Uber without *
anyone seeing him off.
Heavy skillet on the stove. Pat of butter. Bacon and more
bacon are dropped into the pan and begin to sizzle. The
mother watches while her son plays with trains by her feet.
The cat comes purring around the Mother's ankles.
MOTHER
Don’t.
She kicks the cat a little out of the way, then realizing the
cat is hungry, she goes to the cabinet and pulls out a can of
cat food, opening it, and almost gagging from the smell.

She scoops it into the cat’s dish, growling lightly under her

CUT TO:
EXT. FRONT YARD - MOMENTS LATER112 112
Nightbitch stands on the porch looking at a huge pack of
dogs, including the main three. All the dogs face her and
then the Brown Dog, and the collie bring up dead animals - a
raccoon and a rabbit and drop them at her feet. Nightbitch
assumes a dominant position: ears straight up, tail up and
head held high. She stares at the two other dogs who curl
their tails under them and submit. She growls and bites their
necks a bit.
She descends the steps to the pack of dogs and they start
wrestling, engulfing her in some sort of ritualistic dog
behavior: howling and wrestling, tousling each other’s
bodies, biting and pawing each other.
From the open door to the kitchen there is a loud meowl from
the cat. Nightbitch snarls. The cat yowls again, and
Nightbitch leaps.
EXT. PORCH - CONTINUOUS113 113
Nightbitch lunges at the cat grabbing it in her jaws. She
shakes her prey from side to side, smashing the cat’s bones
in her tight jaw. She flings the lifeless, bloody cat down on
the floor and pants, suddenly aware of what she has done.
INT. BEDROOM - MORNING114 114
The mother wakes in her bed. Her son is asleep next to her.
Like a hangover, she is trying to recall the episode of the
night before, but it’s hazy. She rises from the bed and
tentatively leaves the room.
CUT TO:
INT. LIVING ROOM - MORNING115 115

Eat the kitty?
The mother is horrified. She kneels down, turning her son
away from the scene staring into his eyes.
MOTHER
Oh, honey no. We would never eat
the kitty. No. I think maybe our
doggie games have gone too far.

Poor kitty died. But we didn’t want
her to die. This was a terrible
accident.
She picks up her son.

I need you to watch a cartoon while
I clean up and then we will have a
funeral for kitty, okay?
She whisks him away.
EXT. BACKYARD - LATER THAT DAY116 116
The mother and son finish piling dirt on the kitty’s tiny
grave. The mother sobs to herself. And the son starts running
around the yard, not worried about this funeral, barking like

She takes off running, making her way around the play
structure, looking for her son frantically. She can’t find
him. She turns to the one nanny in the park.
MOTHER (CONT’D)
Have you seen a little blond boy?
Suddenly she spots him wandering over a hill in the meadow.
She runs to him and scoops him up, sobbing. Hugging him and
not letting him go.
INT. LIBRARY - DAY118 118
The mother enters the library pushing her stroller with her
son asleep in it. She struggles to get inside without waking
him, but manages. She beelines for the counter, where Norma
is organizing books. She clunks the book The Field Guide to
Magical Women down on the counter.
MOTHER
I don’t want this anymore.
Norma looks at the book calmly.
NORMA
That’s not one of ours.
MOTHER
What? You gave me this book.
NORMA
I don’t think so. Look -
She opens the front cover.

NIGHTBITCH Locked White Shooting Draft July 30, 2022 83
NORMA (CONT’D)
No catalogue card. I don’t know
where this book came from, but we
can’t take it.
She hands it back to the mother with a bit of a smile,
looking toward her son.
NORMA (CONT’D)
I remember when my kids were
little. I had a hard time keeping
everything straight also. No sleep
for years, holding them through ear
aches and stomach aches and bad
dreams. It’s enough for any person
to lose their bearings.
MOTHER
You just didn’t seem like a mother
to me.
NORMA
You didn’t recognize it? You look
into the eyes of other women, and
see that fire flickering behind the
eyes-
The mother’s eyes widen, realizing she is echoing her own
thoughts.
MOTHER
Oh my god.
NORMA
The pain and sacrifice. The shared
bond of all you’ve given up for the
continuation of the species.
The mother is taken aback. She is so relieved to be having
this almost otherwordly conversation.
MOTHER
It’s so much more encompassing than
I could have known.
NORMA
It changes you. Connects you to
some primal urges.
The mother looks down to realize she and Norma are holding
hands across the desk.
NIGHTBITCH Locked White Shooting Draft July 30, 2022 83
NIGHTBITCH Blue Revisions August 30, 2022 84
NORMA (CONT’D)
Keep the book. You can’t unsee it.
It’s like the Wizard of Oz. You’ve
seen life in color now. There’s no
going back.
The mother takes this in.
EXT. LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS119 119
The mother wanders out of the library in a daze, book still
in hand.
INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT120 120
The husband and wife are alone in the kitchen, his suitcase
in the hall. It’s dark outside. They are sitting at the table
with wine glasses like a barrier between them.
HUSBAND
It just doesn’t make sense to me.
MOTHER
I know.
HUSBAND
The cat died and you didn’t even
call me?
MOTHER
It was a pretty traumatic morning.
There was blood all over the steps,
and we had to bury her, and-
HUSBAND
I could have helped.
MOTHER
I guess I’m getting used to doing
things by myself.
HUSBAND
Oh.
MOTHER
This has made some things really
clear to me though-
HUSBAND
Like what?
NIGHTBITCH Blue Revisions August 30, 2022 84
NIGHTBITCH Locked White Shooting Draft July 30, 2022 85
MOTHER
I’m not doing okay. You must see
that. I’m not okay. I’m not happy.
He is quiet. She gets up and moves to the counter, turning
around to face him.
MOTHER (CONT’D)
You were so quick to support me
when I said I didn’t want to be an
artist anymore -
HUSBAND
You said that’s what you wanted.
She paces, eyes fixed on him.
MOTHER
So quick. No protestations from
you! And I keep running over that
conversation in my head. Because it
would have been so nice for you to
encourage me at least a little bit
not to quit. Tell me that I was
good at what I did, and it would be
a shame to give it up. Say that I
would return to it one day. But you
just smiled.
HUSBAND
No I didn’t.
MOTHER
Because somewhere you were getting
what you’ve always wanted. For me
to be a stay at home mom.
NIGHTBITCH Locked White Shooting Draft July 30, 2022 85
NIGHTBITCH Locked White Shooting Draft July 30, 2022 86
HUSBAND
Now, wait a minute-
MOTHER
Just like your mother. And her
mother. A sweet deal for you. You
have your job and I have mine. Only
my job has no pay and no
appreciation and no vacation days
and includes washing your
underwear.
HUSBAND
I didn’t say that. This feels like
a trap.
She’s right in his face now.
MOTHER
You feel trapped? Do you have any
fucking clue how trapped I am? I’ve
found myself in a fucking 1950s
marriage somehow and I have no idea
who I am anymore and all I do is
take care of our son and you and
the fucking cat- before I killed
her.
He looks at her. Everything is different and they both know
it.
HUSBAND
It was your idea to quit your job.
I didn’t suggest that.
MOTHER
You’re right. I agreed to it, but I
had no fucking idea what I was
agreeing to. I didn’t realize I
would feel like a single parent who
has zero help and has to give up my
dreams to take care of everyone! I
don’t even know who I am anymore!
HUSBAND
I don’t know what to say. I didn’t
know you felt like this.
MOTHER
HOW CAN YOU NOT SEE ME? I’m wilting
while you’re out succeeding.
NIGHTBITCH Locked White Shooting Draft July 30, 2022 86
NIGHTBITCH Locked White Shooting Draft July 30, 2022 87
She sits back down with a huge sigh, resting her case, and
starts sipping her wine. He takes her in. And goes in for the
cross examination.
HUSBAND
You think I want it like this? I
don’t want to be married to my
mother. I don’t want to feel your
resentment the moment I enter my
house.
Now it’s the mother’s turn to be quiet.
HUSBAND (CONT’D)
If you were so fucking unhappy why
didn’t you tell me? You expect me
to read your mind? If you tell me
that everything is fine, then I
think that everything is fine. If
you tell me that you want to quit
being an artist and stay home with
our son, and I say ok, I think I’m
supporting you. That’s just some
passive-aggressive bullshit.
MOTHER
Okay... but-
HUSBAND
You aren’t the person I married
either. The person I married let
things go that weren’t important,
and was tough as shit. She was
weird and excited about things in
the world, like reading books and
not just watching reality tv and
passing out after her second glass
of wine.
MOTHER
(taken off guard)
Oh my fucking god. I can’t believe
you’re saying that to me.
HUSBAND
It’s disappointing. For me too. I
don’t know how we ended up here.
You’re too worried about what
happened at Book Babies to ask
about my work or to stay up on
current events.
She is seething now.
NIGHTBITCH Locked White Shooting Draft July 30, 2022 87
NIGHTBITCH Blue Revisions August 30, 2022 88
HUSBAND (CONT’D)
What happened to that girl? The one
I married who made me think about
the world in new and challenging
ways, huh?
MOTHER
She fucking died in childbirth. And
she’s not coming back.
She walks out.
CUT TO:
INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT121 121
The couch is made up as a bed and the husband is sleeping on
it.
EXT. FRONT YARD - CONTINUOUS122 122
The mother stands on the lawn waiting, looking up at the full
moon. She listens, alert. No sounds.
CUT TO:
INT. SMALL FARM HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT123 123
The young girl, our mother when she was small, sits by a
window looking down toward her front porch. The slam of the
front door. She sees her mother like a flash run out the
front door and into the night. There is something animal-like
about the way she leaves. The daughter watches, scared.
INT. SMALL FARM HOUSE - BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT124 124
The young girl is sleeping in her bed when her mother comes
in, and sits at the foot of her bed.
MOTHER’S MOTHER
I’m sorry to wake you.
YOUNG GIRL
Mama?
MOTHER’S MOTHER
I didn’t want you to be scared. I
wanted you to know I’m home.
NIGHTBITCH Blue Revisions August 30, 2022 88
NIGHTBITCH Blue Revisions August 30, 2022 89
YOUNG GIRL
Where did you go?
MOTHER’S MOTHER
I needed some space, so I went
walking in the woods.
YOUNG GIRL
I thought you weren’t going to come
back.
MOTHER’S MOTHER
I will always come back. I’m your
mama forever, and I will always
come back.
She snuggles into her daughter’s small bed with her, pulling
the covers over both of them.
MOTHER’S MOTHER (CONT’D)
One day, when you’re a mommy you’re
going to understand. But you don’t
need to worry about it right now.
They snuggle in together. Safe and close.
EXT. FRONT YARD - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS125 125
The mother is still waiting to hear the call of the dogs, but
it doesn’t come.
INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER126 126
The mother comes inside and sees her husband’s back to her,
prepared to not talk again. She looks to him and he doesn’t
turn. She starts to go toward their room, instead she comes
and sits down next to him, looking right at him. He is
surprised.
MOTHER
Can we talk?
He nods.
MOTHER (CONT’D)
(calmly)
I think we need a separation.
HUSBAND
(also calm)
I’m really confused - I don’t
understand how we got here.
NIGHTBITCH Blue Revisions August 30, 2022 89
NIGHTBITCH Locked White Shooting Draft July 30, 2022 90
MOTHER
I know you are. Because I haven’t
been sharing with you everything
that’s been going on with me. But
to be fair, you also haven’t been
asking.
HUSBAND
Okay.
MOTHER
This agreement we made, that I
would stay home and you would go to
work isn’t working for me anymore.
I need... space. I don’t even know
how to - I don’t know who I am or
what I need. I need to dig around
in the dark and find myself again.
The husband hears this, and asks the question that’s been
brewing the whole time:
HUSBAND
Do you regret having a kid?
The mother really thinks about this.
MOTHER
No. I don’t. But I had no clue what
we were actually getting into. If I
could go back in time, I would have
made us sit down and work out a
more equitable way to do this
parenting thing.
HUSBAND
I would have been open to that.
They both nod.
MOTHER
I’m sorry.
HUSBAND
Me too.
HUSBAND (CONT’D)
Is it too late?
She looks down, resigned.

INT. BEDROOM - THE NEXT MORNING127 127
The husband packs up a bag, throwing his clothes into his
suitcase, defeated. The mother stands in the doorway looking
on, feeling bad but also sure.
INT. KITCHEN - MORNING128 128
The mother looks out the window and sees her husband driving
away. She sighs, unsure if this is right.
The heavy skillet onto the stove, pat of butter. Hashbrowns.
The mother stares as her son plays at her feet. Everything is
the same. But everything is different. She gets down on the
floor with him and plays, silently.
EXT. HIKE - MORNING129 129
The mother, her son and Jen, with her two kids, Liz and her
kid, and Miriam and her kid all hike through the beautiful
forest. The kids are either in backpacks, or walking
themselves. The mother takes in the nature around her.
EXT. MEADOW - LATER THAT MORNING130 130
While the kids and some of the other mothers play, the mother
finds herself sitting next to Jen on a rock, grabbing a sip
of water.
MOTHER
Thank you for letting us come
along. This is so beautiful.
JEN
Yeah. Sometimes you just gotta
sweat to feel alive.
MOTHER
So what did you do before you had
your kids?
JEN
I was a corporate lawyer.
MOTHER
Really?
NIGHTBITCH Yellow Revisions September 26, 2022 91
NIGHTBITCH Yellow Revisions September 26, 2022 92
JEN
Yeah. Worked 80 hour weeks. I made
more money than my husband - I like
to remind him of that sometimes. It
was too intense though- emails at
2 am, working dinners. The
corporate world does not respect
mothers. It’s not the life for
having littles.
MOTHER
How do you like staying home? You
seem really good at it. It’s
totally intimidating.
JEN
Sometimes I like it. A lot of the
time I feel like I have nothing to
use my brain for. Except organizing
our schedule or researching the new
strollers. I use my law degree to
read the preschool contracts.
This makes the mother laugh.
MOTHER
I thought I would like being a stay
at home mom. But it’s just not been
good for me.
JEN
You’re allowed to change your mind.
This lands for the mother.
MOTHER
Can I admit something terrible? I
fantasize about running away from
it all sometimes. I dream about a
faded beach chair and a good book
and not talking to anyone for a
week.
JEN
That’s not terrible at all. Once
when I really needed a break I told
my husband that I had diarrhea and
I locked myself in the bathroom and
read magazines in a bubble bath for
hours. And I was so fucking happy.
They share a laugh.

Hey - some of us are going to order
pizza tonight and put on a movie
for the kids and drink wine. Want
to come?
The mother smiles.
INT. SUBURBAN MANSION - NIGHT131 131
The moms are all sitting around the comfy overstuffed couches
in the main room of Jen’s house sipping off wine, and picking
from a beautiful cheese platter. Jen comes in from the other
room carrying a bottle of wine.
JEN
They’re all set up watching a
movie. They have nuggets, pizza and
carrot sticks and they’re happy.
Who needs more wine?
MOTHER
Me.
She comes and fills up the mother’s glass.
MOTHER (CONT’D)
Do you guys do this a lot?
LIZ
Most Fridays. I couldn’t parent
alone. I need other moms around.
JEN
I need at least one day a week that
I don’t have to figure out what’s
for dinner.
All the moms nod in agreement.
MIRIAM
This is why people have sister
wives.
Liz and Miriam high five. They all laugh.
MOTHER
I don’t have any friends that are
moms.
As she says this she realizes it’s true.

NIGHTBITCH Locked White Shooting Draft July 30, 2022 94
JEN
We were surprised you finally
joined us.
The mother goes quiet for a beat. And tears form in her eyes.
MOTHER
Well... I guess I’ve kind of hit a
breaking point. My husband and I
are getting a separation and I
killed our cat this week, and it
just made me realize I’m not doing
so great. Emotionally.
The room goes silent. Did she go too far?
Finally Liz speaks.
LIZ
I let the fish die. Benign neglect.
I didn’t want to clean the fucking
bowl. The kids didn’t care.
MIRIAM
I accidentally let Percy fly away.
MOTHER
Who’s Percy?
MIRIAM
The parakeet. I hated that bird.
The moms all nod in understanding and share a little laugh.
MOTHER
Wow.
JEN
But what happened with your
husband?
The other moms share a look of worry.
MOTHER
We were so stuck in this horrible
dynamic - me being a stay at home
mom, which maybe I’m not cut out
for, him being the worker who gets
to leave and engage with the world.
I had to break out of it before I
totally lost my mind.

How’s it been so far?
MOTHER
I don’t know yet; it’s really new -
he’s staying at the Extended Stay
America.
JEN
Oy.
MOTHER
He wasn’t around that much before.
It doesn’t feel much different.
LIZ
That’s so hard.
MOTHER
He’s taking him for the night
tomorrow night - it will be the
first time I’ve ever been away from
my baby overnight.
LIZ
It will be good. You’ll be okay.
The moms all offer her pats on the back and kind looks.
EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - DAY132 132
The mother puts her son into her husband’s car, clicking him
into his carseat. She kisses him and watches them drive away.
She turns back to her house, almost confused as to what to do
next.
INT. STUDIO - DAY133 133
The mother, in ratty art clothes, is alone in her office. She
stands on a chair pulling things from the closet she hasn’t
seen in years. A film camera, paints, tools, laying
everything out on the floor. She is overwhelmed.
She pulls out her phone. Despite herself, she starts
scrolling through pictures of her son. Him being silly, on
the swings, asleep. She misses him.
She turns her attention back to her art, and tries to get her
focus back.

EXT. STREETS - EARLY EVENING135 135
The streetlights are just turning on, as the day turns to

street. She pushes her body, running with a purpose. With
each step she runs faster, happier.
NIGHTBITCH Pink Revisions September 6, 2022 96
NIGHTBITCH Locked White Shooting Draft July 30, 2022 97
She runs past other houses with their lights on - parents
inside tending to their children. Scenes of life that she
ignores as she runs.
INT. EXTENDED STAY APARTMENT- EVENING136 136
The son sits at a big person table in a chair that is too low
for him so he’s propped up with a couch pillow, feet
swinging. The husband puts a plate of food in front of him -
pasta with red sauce from a jar.
HUSBAND
Voila. Dinner is served.
The son immediately sweeps his hand and knocks the pasta to
the floor. The plate shatters in a mess of red.
HUSBAND (CONT’D)
NOOOOOOO! Shit!
Suddenly he tracks his son who is about to explore this mess
he’s made.
HUSBAND (CONT’D)
Wait wait, don’t get down. Stay in
your chair. There’s broken glass.
Or porcelain or whatever it is.
Hold on. Ah! Hold on. Where are the
towels?
He grabs his son in one arm, holding him by the waist, and
starts searching the drawers for towels. Finds one, throws it
on the mess.
HUSBAND (CONT’D)
How do I do this? Oh my god. Hold
on.
He puts his son down on the couch and turns on the tv.
HUSBAND (CONT’D)
Don’t move! Do you hear me? Don’t
move.
He goes to the kitchen, and starts surveying the damage.
HUSBAND (CONT’D)
Okay. Going great. I am killing it.
He grabs a roll of paper towels and gets down on his hands
and knees, first picking up the shards of plate, then trying
to clean the tomato sauce.
NIGHTBITCH Locked White Shooting Draft July 30, 2022 97
NIGHTBITCH Pink Revisions September 6, 2022 98
As he’s on his hands and knees scrubbing the mess with paper
towels, he suddenly hears something - it catches his
attention - something far away- a howl - time slows down. He
looks toward the window confused and toward his son on the
couch. He is skeptical that whatever he heard was real but
he’s also aware that something is happening.
INT. STUDIO - NIGHT137 137
The mother, covered with paint, has put a huge canvas down on
the floor that she’s painted a wash of purples and greens.
She has a pile of bones, and gold paint. She is laying a gold
raccoon skeleton down on the canvas in pieces and trying to
decide what should happen next. She is “in the zone”.
INT. LIVING ROOM - MORNING138 138
The mother opens the door for her husband and son. She is
showered, dressed for the day and bright eyed.
MOTHER
There’s my baby!!
She hugs her son and kisses him all over. Then hugs her
husband, which surprises him a bit.
MOTHER (CONT’D)
How did it go?
They come in and all walk into the kitchen.
INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS139 139
The kitchen is cleaner than we’ve ever seen it. The husband
clocks this. On the table is orange juice, a stack of
pancakes and frozen hash brown cakes all browned and
delicious looking.
MOTHER
Come. Have some food.
The husband starts helping himself.
HUSBAND
We had a good night, didn’t we,
dude? It was hard. I’m not gonna
lie. It was... hard. He missed you.
And my place is... a little weird.
Sterile.
The mother smiles.

MOTHER
Sure. I get it.
HUSBAND
How was your first night alone?
The mother hesitates. But then decides to be honest.
MOTHER
It was really wonderful, actually.
I think I have an idea for a new
project. I’m just really focused.
It’s amazing how efficient I can be
now that I never have any time.
Give me an hour and I’m doing more
than I used to do in a week.
The husband nods, a little disappointed.
MOTHER (CONT’D)
(to the kid)
You want some hashbrowns, baby?
She starts to make a plate for him. The three of them sit at
the little plastic table in small plastic chairs and enjoy
their food together.

The mother is walking the husband to the door, while the son
plays with trains on the floor in the living room.
MOTHER
So I’ll drop him off Friday
morning?
HUSBAND
(sort of dazed)
Okay. Yeah. I need to get some toys
at my place. He was so bored. And
maybe a stuffy or something?
MOTHER
That’s a good idea. I’ll send you
the link for that dinosaur he
loves. You could get him one for

he thought he’d been kidnapped.
This makes the mother laugh.
MOTHER
That will change. This is gonna be
good for both of you.
The husband nods again, unsure.
HUSBAND
He’s like ‘who is this weird man
living in this sad apartment
complex with all the other sad
men?’ I swear the whole place is
newly divorced dads. All these kids
at the pool kind of just confused -
not a mom in sight.
The mother enjoys this description. He’s jovial but dark. The
mother doesn’t know whether to laugh or cry.
MOTHER
I just picture all the kids getting
sunburned because nobody remembers
the sunscreen.
This makes the husband laugh now.
HUSBAND
Oh man, I didn’t even think of
sunscreen.
MOTHER
See you Friday?
HUSBAND
Yep.
She closes the door behind him.
The mother turns toward her son, excited to see him.

EXT. DOG PARK - LATE AFTERNOON141 141
The mother and son are huddled together in the corner of the
dog park, scoping out their favorite dog. They approach an
owner who is looking at his phone.
MOTHER
May we pet your dog?
He nods nonchalantly.
MOTHER (CONT’D)
We love dogs!
The mother and son pet the dog lovingly, while the owner is a
bit creeped out. Another dog catches their eye, with an owner
nearby.
MOTHER (CONT’D)
That one?
The son nods excitedly. The mother taps the dog owner on her
shoulder.
MOTHER (CONT’D)
May we chase your dog?
The owner doesn’t even look up. So the mother and son start
chasing the dogs around the dog park. Having a ball, barking
and playing with the dogs without a care in the world.
Suddenly on the other end of the park the mother spots the
three dogs she knows, the Brown Dog and the other two. They
are in a pack at the end of the park, and seem to be calling
to the mother, nudging her with their noses in the air. She
looks at them, thinks about it, and then shakes her head
sweetly.
The three dogs exit the park and the mother and her son
continue running and chasing the dogs, while the sun sets
over the park.
INT. MINIATURE TRAIN DISPLAY - DAY142 142
The mother and son make their way through an enormous model
train display that is very cool even for adults: hills with
tiny windmills, small towns with little houses and their
lights on, small scenes of country life with trains chugging
along the tracks. The entire thing is lit up with Christmas
lights and is spectacular.

NIGHTBITCH Locked White Shooting Draft July 30, 2022 102
The mother and son walk along pointing at different parts of
the display oohing and ahhing - running after a train as it
makes its way along the tracks. She picks him up, so he can
see every part of it. He hugs on to her neck, in awe.
MOTHER
It’s so cool right?
He nods, happy.
MOTHER (CONT’D)
You know that I love being your
mom, right?
She kisses him on his cheek.
MOTHER (CONT’D)
It makes me so happy. You are a

They hug, her emotion taking over in this moment. She hugs
him in her arms, with the other visitors stream around them,
not noticing, just hugging her son.

Warm light pools from the other houses.

The mother’s mother comes into focus, lying on the grass
where we found her before, listening to opera, dreaming of
another life.
MOTHER (V.O.)
...And scream at you ‘you’re

Close up on the mother’s mother’s face, lost in thought in

The mother continues to jog past warm windows with scenes
inside of families and life.
MOTHER (V.O.)
...Don’t just do it for you, do it
for me too!’
As she jogs, from over a neighboring fence, a dog leaps over
the fence and starts jogging behind the mother, without her
noticing. Then from another backyard comes another dog who
seems to burst out from nowhere. And then another. One jumps
out of a front door. One bursts through a window.
The mother jogs, and behind her in formation, fifteen large
dogs all silently run with her.
CUT TO:

Our mother is installing her pieces into a large gorgeous
gallery with huge ceilings - it’s the type of hip chic
gallery from her former life. She is the only one there now,
on top of a ladder, installing a piece, connecting it to the
ceiling. When she lifts her arms you get a glimpse of her
unshaved armpit hair.
Her piece is an enormous self portrait - a photograph of
herself mostly naked, covered in dirt and leaves with blood
on her chin, in a howling position like a giant dog-woman in
the woods. There’s a majestic quality to the photo and the
frame is made of animal bones that have been cleaned and
painted gold, with gems added to them.
MOTHER
(speaking to herself
while screwing hooks into
the ceiling)
I always thought motherhood was
sort of a weak state of being -
like very basic and passive. But
motherhood is a far more primal
active thing than that.

It is probably the most violent
experience a human can have aside
from death itself.
Around the gallery are similar pieces about the other mothers
in her circle - Jen as a tiger, roaring, her body covered in
bloody slash marks like she’s been in a fight with another
tiger.
MOTHER (CONT’D)
A child’s first act is violence
against the woman who created it.
Yet still the mother loves the
child with the most powerful love
known in this universe.
Miriam is a wild boar, Liz is a moose. And Norma is there as
a wise owl.
MOTHER (CONT’D)
This thing comes from us. It rips
its way out of us, literally tears
us in two, in a wash of blood and
shit and piss.
The mother steps back examining her work, taking it all in.
In between the big pieces of the women are taxidermy animals -
rabbits, and squirrels, laid out like offerings to these
goddesses.
MOTHER (CONT’D)
Or it is cut from us with a knife,
our organs taken out only to be put
back in and sewn up. So no -
motherhood is not sunshine and baby
powder, little pastel mints and
lacy frocks. Motherhood is fucking
brutal - and it turns us into
something we weren’t before.
She looks to the portrait of herself. She is pleased.
MOTHER (CONT’D)

INT. GALLERY - NIGHT147 147
The gallery is teeming with people- hip people, and suburb
people all co-mingling.
Spectators holding glasses of wine are making their way
through the gallery admiring the mother’s work.
Sequence of each of the women next to their pieces. Jen
stands next to her piece of her as a tiger, looking proud and
majestic. The mother looks on. Miriam, Liz stand by their
pieces having similar moments of pride. The mother cheers.
This is what she’s been working for.
INT. GALLERY - LATER148 148
The mother is chatting with Jen, Miriam and Liz.
LIZ
I feel like everyone is looking at
me. I can’t get used to it.
MIRIAM
Really? It feels awesome to me.
They all laugh.
JEN
(to the mother)
I’m just really impressed by you.
And feel so honored to be a part of
this. I feel really seen. Thank
you!
She raises a glass to the mother and they all cheers.
LIZ
Is it true the times is here?
MOTHER
That’s what I hear.

MIRIAM
I feel like I should try to talk to *
the reporter. *
JEN *
I love you but no. *
LIZ *
NO! *
They all laugh, just then Naya, Freida and Lemuel approach
the mother, tapping her on the shoulder. She turns her
attention to them.
NAYA
This is pretty fucking cool -
especially for the suburbs.
Lemuel hugs the mother.
LEMUEL
I’m really into this show- like
blown away. It’s very provocative.
Very you.
MOTHER
Thank you!
FREIDA
It reminds me a little bit of
Charlotte Gibley’s work from last
year, but I mean that in a good
way. Like it’s not derivative, it’s
in conversation.
The mother sighs, then spots Norma through the crowd heading
toward the door. She doesn’t think twice and walks away.
MOTHER
Okay, then.
She weaves her way through the crowd, listening to people hub-
bub about her work. She makes her way to Norma.
MOTHER (CONT’D)
You’re here. Thank you so much for
coming.
NORMA
Thank you for listening to the
call.

What?
Norma motions to the work.
NORMA
You did it. You listened. They
called. You answered.
The mother is left a bit speechless. Norma pats her on the
shoulder and walks away, disappearing into the crowd.
Suddenly the Mother sees her husband sitting alone across the
room, staring at one of her pieces. She just watches him. He *
doesn’t see her. But he’s quiet. *
INT. GALLERY - LATER THAT NIGHT149 149 *
The husband and mother are alone cleaning up from the night. *
The husband sweeps, the mother holds a garbage bag, and picks *
up stray cups and napkins from the floor. *
MOTHER *
Did you see Freida? I can’t believe *
I got her out of the city. *
She laughs a little to herself, and looks to the husband who *
is quiet. *
MOTHER *(CONT’D)
You ok? *
HUSBAND *
Not really. *
She stops what she’s doing and looks at him. *
HUSBAND (CONT’D)
I didn’t get it.

more ... I don’t know what. I *

INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT150 150
Under a home-made fort. The son, mother and husband are
huddled with a flashlight in a sort of magical cave.
MOTHER (V.O.)
There are times when I look to my
son and I cannot tell where he
begins and I end. He is that much a
part of me.
SON
(to his parents)
Be bears.
The mother and husband assume their bear positions- paws up,
on their haunches. The mother opens her mouth and a real bear
roar comes out - loud and clear.
The husband opens his mouth and another real bear roar comes
out.
The mother looks to her husband, smiling.
HUSBAND
(to the son in a bear
voice)
Are we hungry?
MOTHER (V.O.)
This must be what it is to be an
animal. To look at another and say
‘I am so much that other thing that
we are part of one another’.
MOTHER
(in a bear voice)
I want blackberries.
HUSBAND
(bear voice)
I want salmon.
SON
(as a bear)
I’ll get blackberries and Santa.
The parents both laugh, surprised.
MOTHER
He said salmon not Santa, baby.
But the son has exited the cave. The mother cuddles up to her
husband, under the blanket of their bed.

NIGHTBITCH Goldenrod Revisions November 2, 2022 111
MOTHER (V.O.)
You say ‘here is my skin. Here is
yours. Beneath the moon we pile
inside the warm cave, becoming one
creature to save our warmth’.
He caresses her cheek and then their son pops back in the
cave, closing the blanket behind him, holding his hands out
as though he’s carrying a bounty, although they’re empty.
SON
Okay I got blackberries and Santa’s
candy canes... and his head.
The mother and husband burst out laughing and grab their son
in a warm embrace.
HUSBAND
What? We’ve got Santa’s head here
to eat?
They all pretend to eat their bounty.
MOTHER (V.O.)
This is how it’s always been and
how it will continue to be.
From outside their blanket cave, we see the warm light of
their game, their shadows look like real bears in the cave -
the sounds of bear roars fill the warm bedroom, which is now
transformed into a forest with trees having sprouted up all
around the tent.
MOTHER’S VOICE
AGHHHHHHHH.
CUT TO:
INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY151 151 *
Close up on the mother’s face. She is sweating, veins popping
on her head, guttural sounds coming from her.
MOTHER
AUHHHHHHHHHHH!
Pull out to reveal she is squatting, partially draped in a
gown, in very active labor, a huge bulging belly. This is not
the labor we tend to see in movies. This is real labor. Blood
and guts labor.
She is squatting, leaning against the bed, with her husband
holding one of her hands and trying to help.

HUSBAND
Yes yes. You’re doing so well.
You’re doing great. You’re amazing.
The mother shakes her head, tears streaming.
MOTHER
AHHHHH! I can’t. I can’t do it.
The MIDWIFE, a wonderful older wise woman, stands so the
mother is face to face with her, nose to nose. She speaks
clearly and seriously.
MIDWIFE
Listen to me. You can do this. You
were made to do this. Your mother
did this. Her mother did this. It’s
time to dig deep and find the
strength because it’s time to meet
your daughter. NOW!
The mother cries huge tears, hearing this and knowing it’s
true, wailing in this moment.
MOTHER
Okay. Okay.
Close on her face: strong, in brutal pain, fully animal. She
takes a deep breath and makes a noise like nothing else- part
scream, part howl, every part of her animal.
MOTHER (CONT’D)
AGHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!
CUT TO BLACK.
