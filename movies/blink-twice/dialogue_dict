She walks over to him. Behind him... Hannah Marshall... bound and gagged. Oh, THAT'S why I was running... She SCREAMS, tries to get away. But suddenly-- her arms FLY back violently, as Slater grabs the DRAWSTRING of her GARMENT. She tips forward. THONK--her forehead hits a STONE. Blood trickles into her eyes. So that's how she got that scar. Stillness for a beat. Our LIZARD watches from its tree. Suddenly she's JERKED backwards. Slater expertly ties Frida's sleeves together, bends her legs back, binding her ankles with the drawstring in a horrifying cocoon. And that's what these things are really for. He flips her onto her back."}, {"character": "SLATER", "dialogue": "Hey. What do you call a cow with no legs? Frida looks at him... and then starts to LAUGH at the familiar joke. She's already forgotten.... CUE: \"GUILTY\" by Barbara Streisand and Barry Gibb. PUSSY ISLAND - Kravitz/Himelstein 2ND WHITE REVISION 85. He's standing above her. Smiling. Backlit. Beautiful."}, {"character": "SLATER", "dialogue": "Man... you always find a way to get into the party. Frida glares up at him. Her face is bloody. On the side table: the VAPE and THE KNIFE.

I'm just saying, there's the version of this we're all just havin' a good time, sippin' green juice an mimosas in a few hours. Brunch is real. You know what's not real? Forgiveness. I Slater King, formally apologize. I've sought therapy and I plan to take a leave of absence from my company and to deal with this issue head on. Blah, blah, blah, sorry sorry, sorry, SORRY! So, We good? Oh no? There is no forgiveness. There's only forgetting. BEHIND FRIDA'S BACK: Slowly, quietly, she is RIPPING a hole in her garment sleeve with the glass shard."}, {"character": "SLATER KING (CONT'D)", "dialogue": "There is no forgiveness. There's only forgetting. Which you're incredible at by the way. You forgot the entire place. I didn't know it could do that. I mean, this is amazing. You're amazing. You inspire me! You make me think bigger. Imagine what humans can do if we were just free from our trauma. Oh, this is gonna be great. Like, my sister. She's so fucked up, cuz she remembers everything. \"How could you play tennis with that man after everything he did to us when we were little?\" And I'm over here like, \"What'd he do?\" You know this was never about sex right? This is about creating a safe space. Where we can learn about ourselves. With no judgement, no shame. Because There is no past. No future. Just me and you. Right here. Right now. And you came back. You didn't leave me. Let's Start fresh. What do ya think? BANG!!!! Gunshot outside. Slater FLINCHES.

Slater walks back to Sarah. Vic GRUNTS again, louder. Did he say \"don't?\"........ Slater puffs his vape. He pulls Sarah's head up by the hair. Special knife to her throat. Frida and Sarah lock eyes. And then... Slater COUGHS. He stands. Drops the knife. He looks around, uncertain. Then: SLATER I just want to say, I really do think it's amazing what women can do when they band together. COUGH. Excuse me. COUGH. Excuse me. Oh my god, what happened to Vic!?! He backpedals, and TRIPS over Camilla's body, falls over backwards, knocking LIT CANDLES all over the floor. He stands, looks around. Confused. Another vape pull. SLATER Oh my god, what happened to Vic?!? He steps forward, STUMBLES on Camilla again. SLATER Oh shit-- He looks around the room like he's noticing all the dead bodies for the first time. Behind him, the candles have set the cardboard box on fire; and the polaroids. The flames spread. He COUGHS VIOLENTLY, looks at the vape in his hand."}, {"character": "FRIDA", "dialogue": "You never know what's in those things, man."}, {"character": "VIC", "dialogue": "Gnarly."}, {"character": "SARAH", "dialogue": "Got a light?"}, {"character": "FRIDA", "dialogue": "I knew I forgot something.
