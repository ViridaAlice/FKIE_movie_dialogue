      OVER BLACK...
A musical number is coming to an end, the lyrics saying 
something along the lines of “I’ve got my top hat and my 
tails and hundreds of beautiful giiiiirls!” We HEAR DANCERS 
coming off stage, breathing hard, heels clacking on metal 
stairs, hallway chatter, the bustle of dozens of women.
FADE IN:
INT. LE RAZZLE DAZZLE. BACKSTAGE - NIGHT
The number ends as many DANCERS including MARY-ANNE (35) and 
JODIE (19) run off stage.
MARY-ANNE
Did someone raid a cemetery for 
this fucken audience?
As the dancers funnel through a doorway, Mary-Anne rips her 
costume on a door handle.
MARY-ANNE (CONT'D)
Shit--
JODIE
Shhh!
MARY-ANNE
Did that just rip?
JODIE (CONT'D)
Go go go.
INT. LE RAZZLE DAZZLE. BACKSTAGE CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS
Mary-Anne and Jodie hustle through the labyrinth-like 
underbelly of the theater, past huge set pieces...
MARY-ANNE
When did they install that new door 
handle?
JODIE
Three months ago?
Hallways lined with shelves of feathered headpieces...
MARY-ANNE
That thing’s like asking to get 
ripped costumes. Are you sure?? Is 
it really ripped??

JODIE
Yeah, it’s ripped-- I have like, 
20/20 vision.
MARY-ANNE
Good for fucken you, Jodie.
INT. LE RAZZLE DAZZLE. DRESSING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
A simple curtain serves as a door to the dressing room where 
Jodie, Mary-Anne and other dancers change costumes, bobbing 
and weaving around each other for costume pieces, wigs, 
rhinestoned accessories: they've done this a THOUSAND times. 
Bulb rimmed mirror dressing table stations show years of 
personalization by the dancers. 
SHELLY (50’s but ageless and beautiful inside and out) 
enters. Her costume is badly ripped.
SHELLY
I caught my wing on that door 
handle!
MARY-ANNE
It’s a trap-- they’re so desperate 
for money, they’re trying to 
squeeze it back out of us--
JODIE
That’s paranoid--
SHELLY
They need to change that! I mean 
look at this! 
(re: her ripped wing)
Look at this gaping hole--
JODIE
You need to change your costume, 
Shelly!
SHELLY
I am, I will, I just-- ugh, look at 
this.
She mourns the costume.
SHELLY (CONT'D)
I love this darn wing.
Jodie’s costume is on so she helps Shelly.

JODIE
(to Shelly)
Gimme your shoes.
Shelly sits back on her table. Jodie unfastens Shelly’s shoes 
and puts on her other shoes.
SHELLY
You know, of all the costumes in 
the whole show, these are the 
oldest wings.
(to the wing fabric)
Shoot. Ida’s gonna kill me.
MARY-ANNE
Whatever. That old Russian bitch 
has hated me for like, nine years--
JODIE
Because you keep losing rhinestones 
and feathers--
(to Shelly)
Where’s your clip-ons?
MARY-ANNE
It’s not like I’m trying to be a 
klutz-- I’m fucken dancing out 
there, what the hell, I am DANCING. 
SHELLY
It’s just so disappointing. Lemons 
and now this.
MARY-ANNE
Lemons??
SHELLY
Oh, they’re just so expensive 
recently. 
JODIE
Clip-ons, SHELLY!
SHELLY
They’re right there, sweetie. 
JODIE
Okay can you please put them on?

SHELLY
Yes, I’m doing it, jeez. They’re 
like eighty-nine cents a piece, 
which I just think-- it’s-- it’s 
lemons-- it’s not even really food, 
you know? It’s like a garnish or 
it’s, you know, it’s like herbs-- 
it’s like accessories-- 
MARY-ANNE
Who needs lemons??
JODIE
Let’s go-- 
They exit, heading back toward the stage.
INT. LE RAZZLE DAZZLE. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
Shelly, Jodie and Mary-Anne adjust pieces of their costumes 
as they hurry to the stage. 
SHELLY
Well I’m buying some nice salmon 
steaks for dinner cuz I’m 
entertaining tomorrow, and there’s 
this beautiful picture of-- of 
these salmon steaks in the Ina 
Garten cookbook?
JODIE
Music is changing!!
Jodie works on Shelly’s headdress snaps.
SHELLY
And there are lovely thin lemon 
slices on the-- on the salmon, and 
so I do. I need them, I need the 
lemons.
JODIE
Shelly, you’ve got the wrong clip 
ons!
SHELLY
When did they put that door handle 
in anyway like two weeks ago?
JODIE
It was three months ago.

I always forget it’s there.
JODIE
That’s cuz you’re old!
SHELLY
I’m older, I’m not actually that 
old--
INT. LE RAZZLE DAZZLE. STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS
They head up the stairs, Shelly, behind the others.
Jodie, Mary-Anne and then Shelly go back through the door 
with the bad handle.
JODIE
C’mon, c’mon.
MARY-ANNE
Fuck you, door handle.
SHELLY
I wish that hadn’t happened. I wish 
I could go back in time, see that 
door handle, say to myself “Ope, 
there’s that terrible door handle, 
it’s right there” and then, you 
know, just not have--
They pass EDDIE (50’s), the stage manager. 
EDDIE
Do you girls mind moving a little, 
a little fucken faster? Everyone 
else is out there, you’re the only 
ones taking your time like you’re 
at fucken brunch. 
MARY-ANNE
Like anyone gives a flying shit out 
there, Eddie. What are there, 
twelve people?
EDDIE
Excuse me, you know who gives a 
shit? I do. I give a shit. My job 
that you girls get on stage.
SHELLY
Have we ever not made it on stage, 
Eddie?

TITLE CARD: THE LAST SHOWGIRL
INT. SUPERMARKET - DAY.
Shelly and her best friend ANNETTE (60, amazing legs, ex￾showgirl) are at the checkout counter.
INT. SUPERMARKET. SELF CHECK-OUT - MOMENTS LATER
Shelly tries to scan her items as Annette flips through 
People Magazine. 
ANNETTE
So who’s the guy? 
SHELLY
Rick. He saw me leaving the 
theater.
ANNETTE
Ooh a little stage door Johnny 
situation? Paging stage door 
Johnnayyy!! Aisle four!
SHELLY
No, shh! No-- he recognized me in 
the parking lot.
ANNETTE
He think you’re an escort on the 
side?
SHELLY
No, Annette.
ANNETTE
Guys think that! Well they do.
SHELLY
Rick is nice. He likes me. He 
doesn’t think that.

It’s on there, it’s right there.
ANNETTE
Yeah but it’s telling you to scan 
it again.
CHECK OUT MACHINE
Please scan your item again.
ANNETTE
Put it in the bag.
...Shelly does. Then her flip phone alerts. She looks at it. 
Her face drops. Annette takes the phone, squints, reads it 
herself.
ANNETTE (CONT'D)
Have to cancel tonight. Working 
late. Rain check. Sorry.
(off Shelly, bummed)
You wanna return the fish? 
SHELLY
...No, it’s okay.
INT. SHELLY’S HOUSE. KITCHEN - LATE AFTERNOON
Shelly slices lemons, placing them on raw salmon filets as 
Annette, Mary-Anne and Jodie weave about the kitchen. Jodie 
sets the dinner table. Annette makes margaritas. Mary-Anne 
opens a naval orange. 
ANNETTE
Well then I won so what the fuck 
does it matter if I previously lost?
(to Mary-Anne)
You wanna maybe not eat an orange 
before dinner?
MARY-ANNE
There’s only enough fish for two 
people, Annette, I’m trying to get 
it where I can. 
SHELLY
I know this is impromptu but I got 
enough-- I got a lot. Men like to 
be fed. 
JODIE
Shelly who was this guy anyway?

ANNETTE
Rick the dick. I bet you he was 
married.
SHELLY
He was divorced-- he didn’t have a 
ring.
ANNETTE
You check his pockets?
SHELLY
He liked me, okay?
ANNETTE
Uh-huh, that’s why we’re eating his 
fish. Listen, you guys don’t have 
to worry about me. I’m a very lucky 
person-- I have luck, you know what 
I mean? I have it, it’s in me. Not 
everybody’s like that.
MARY-ANNE
Sure.
JODIE
Are you gonna save your winnings 
for when you retire?
ANNETTE
Retire?! Like, bankers retire. 
Waddaya think I have a 501k? I’m 
gonna work and then I’m gonna work 
some more and then I’m gonna die. 
I’ll probably die in my uniform. 
That’s my long-term plan.
JODIE
You don’t want to retire?
ANNETTE
It’s not an option, Jodie.
JODIE
Isn’t it like, a requirement?
ANNETTE
Esmee Rodriguez-- She’s 83, still 
cocktailing at the Paris. 
SHELLY
No way, she’s not 83.

ANNETTE
Yes she is, she’s 83. I got an 
invitation to the party but I 
didn’t go, I hate soft foods.
JODIE
I can’t wait to retire.
MARY-ANNE
You’re nineteen!
JODIE
It just seems like a wonderful time 
in life, I dunno, I just think it 
seems fun-- learning new things, 
you know, maybe taking up a new 
language--
ANNETTE
You can’t learn a new language that 
late in life, the brain doesn’t 
work that way--
SHELLY
I want to learn French one day.
JODIE
I love languages. I can say “Je 
m’appelle Jodie.” I know how to say 
“My Name Is Jodie” in five languages.
MARY-ANNE
That’s like, the most useless 
phrase ever.
JODIE (CONT'D)
--Including English-- 
Useless?? Are you kidding??
MARY-ANNE (CONT'D)
You could just point to yourself 
and say “JODIE.”
JODIE
Shelly, let’s learn French 
together. 
SHELLY
Je m’appelle Shelly!
ANNETTE
Guys, I like my life, okay? I like 
it. I like my job, not everyone 
likes playing grab-ass with a bunch 
of coked up gamblers at ten am--
JODIE
But you are one.

SHELLY
Annette is a bon vivant!
ANNETTE
French! 
The doorbell RINGS. Shelly wipes her hands.
ANNETTE (CONT'D)
Who’s that?
JODIE
Oh, it’s Eddie!
MARY-ANNE
What?? That’s gonna be so weird.
JODIE
No it’s not. He’s like our dad.
MARY-ANNE
He’s not like our dad, he’s seen 
our boobs like a thousand times.
ANNETTE
Haven’t you ever heard of an 
impromptu girl’s night??
JODIE
He’s sweet! When was the last time 
you saw Eddie anyway?
ANNETTE
I haven’t seen Eddie since I left 
the show. And I have not missed him.
JODIE
Well that’s not nice. I feel like 
we’re all kinda like a big family.
SHELLY
Sisters, sure, I can see that--
MARY-ANNE
If this is a family, it’s pretty 
fucked up we’re all tits out all 
the time.

JODIE
No like, you’re our mom... and 
Eddie’s--
MARY-ANNE
You’re trying to make Shelly your 
mom and Eddie your dad? 
The doorbell rings again. Jodie looks dejected.
Annette, with her margarita, heads towards the patio, Mary￾Anne and Jodie take their own drinks and follow her.
SHELLY
I mean, I guess I think of us as a 
family.
ANNETTE
Well I’ll be outside, trying to get 
drunk real fast.
CUT TO:
EXT. SHELLY’S HOUSE. BACKYARD PATIO - MOMENTS LATER
Shelly brings Eddie outside. He has a bottle of red wine in 
hand. Mary-Anne, Annette and Jodie lounge on the old Sears 
furniture. Eddie is awkward as hell.
SHELLY
Look who’s here!
JODIE
Welcome, Eddie!
Mary-Anne glares at her.
EDDIE
Hi girls, Annette. Nice to see you.
ANNETTE
Eddie. I’d hug you but I’m 
sweating.
EDDIE
That’s okay.
He goes in for a hug.
ANNETTE
No really, I’m not gonna hug you. 
I’m sweating.

ANNETTE
But it’s awful good to see ya, 
Eddie!
EDDIE
You too, the show’s not the same 
without you.
ANNETTE
It’s not? I feel like it is.
EDDIE
Well... Technically... it is. It is 
the same show.
ANNETTE
Yeah...
EDDIE
I was just talking figuratively.
ANNETTE
Got it.
Jodie eyes Mary-Anne: wtf is Annette’s problem??
ANNETTE (CONT'D)
Who took over my track again? Was 
it Valerie?
EDDIE
Francine.
ANNETTE
Francine-- she sucked-- She can’t 
fouetté. What a terrible dancer. 
EDDIE
She’s not that bad.
ANNETTE
How did she take over my track? She 
does my pas de deux in the fairy 
ballet? She can’t partner. Did she 
ever learn how to partner?
EDDIE
It’s been six years since you left 
and she does it every night so 
yeah, she figured it out.

SHELLY
So, Eddie brought some wine. Should 
I... should I open it up?
(she squints at the label)
It’s a Malbec. A little Malbec for 
anyone? Annette? Mary-Anne?
MARY-ANNE
I’m allergic to red wine.
ANNETTE
Um, no. I’m drinking a margaritas.
SHELLY
Okay.
She heads into the house for a wine key.
EDDIE
I just brought it because-- well 
it’s funny-- when I was on 
Siegfried and Roy, those guys had 
us over on off days and-- and they 
went pretty hard on the red wine...
MARY-ANNE
(that’s not a thing)
They went hard on red wine?
EDDIE
Yeah... was ages ago. 
(awkward pause)
There was this one time I got 
caught in the escape trap with the 
white tiger.
JODIE
What?! No!
EDDIE
Well, the white tiger is supposed to 
disappear off the stage, right? 
During his trick. And when I open the 
escape door on the floor of the 
stage, the tiger knows to go through 
a tunnel, and into a holding pen. But 
somehow... I got caught in the 
holding pen. With the white tiger. 
Man, I was shitting with fear.
JODIE
That is insane!! Did the tiger swat 
at you?

ANNETTE
...Great story, Eddie.
INT. SHELLY'S HOUSE. EAT-IN-KITCHEN - LATER
Shelly, Eddie, Annette, Mary-Anne and Jodie eat. Shelly’s the 
only one with no fish on her plate. Eddie looks really 
uncomfortable. Clearing his throat. Looking at the ceiling. 
Mary-Anne gets up and goes to rummage through the fridge.
MARY-ANNE
I’m still hungry. It was like two 
ounces of fish.
SHELLY
There’s a Cup a’ Noodles above the 
fridge.
Jodie leans into Eddie, sotto.
JODIE
Eddie, you okay? I swallowed a 
teeny fish bone, did you too?
EDDIE
No, no. 
(nervous)
Um, listen so, I didn’t come here 
tonight just to um-- uh, I need to 
tell you something. 
SHELLY
Are you okay?
EDDIE
...Muffy told me that the show is 
closing.
Shelly stops dead in her tracks. Annette stops eating. Mary￾Anne closes the fridge.

EDDIE
Don’t call me a shithead, Annette.
ANNETTE
Well then don’t fucken drop a bomb 
an hour after you’ve arrived!
MARY-ANNE
Hold on, hold on. Muffy is senile, 
okay? She’s a thousand years old 
and she’s about to fucken die.
SHELLY
She’s not senile. 
(to Eddie)
Are you-- I mean, what did she say?
EDDIE
These new casino owners, they want 
to put their own stamp on a place. 
They brought in the circus-- that 
show’s doing really well--
SHELLY
It is?? I just think who puts money 
into a circus that’s not Cirque du 
Soleil, right? That’s dumb--
EDDIE
That’s the whole point. It’s 
alternative, it’s dirty--
SHELLY
A dirty circus?
EDDIE
Yeah, you know, it’s edgy-- it’s 
for adults.
JODIE
I knew when we started sharing our 
theater, when they took over our 
Thursday, Friday and Saturday 
performances, it was a bad sign.

Mary-Anne cringes.
EDDIE
Le Razzle Dazzle-- it’s old, it’s 
the only show left of its kind on 
the strip. 
SHELLY
But the fact that it’s the only one 
left-- that’s why it’s so special! 
I mean our show is a show! Come on! 
-- The costumes, the sets.
MARY-ANNE
It is a dinosaur, Shelly.
EDDIE
I think we’re gonna get notice 
tomorrow.
SHELLY
Are you kidding? You heard this 
from-- from Muffy?
EDDIE
Yeah.
Shelly runs out, failing to hide her emotion. 
ANNETTE
(suddenly outraged, 
yelling at Eddie.)
What is wrong with you?? Whaddayou 
like being the bearer of bad news? 
EDDIE
I thought it was important 
information, I wanted them to hear 
it from me.
ANNETTE
Well your important information 
just broke her fucking heart.

I regret to inform you that Le

of Muffy, as well as our long-time

CUT TO:
EXT. LE RAZZLE DAZZLE. ROOFTOP - EVENING
Shelly, in full costume and make-up, looks out at Las Vegas. 
The feathers and rhinestones of her costume, her enormous 
fake eyelashes, caked on foundation, and crusty red lipstick 
juxtaposed with the evening sky and purple mountains in the 
distance are an almost impossible mix of nature and artifice.
Jodie approaches.
JODIE
...Hey.
She looks out at the view too.
SHELLY
If they just pumped a little more 
money into our advertising 
campaign... I mean our shots are 
from the early eighties...
JODIE
Aren’t you in some of those shots?
SHELLY
I am...
JODIE
You had the Hindenburg solo.
SHELLY
I did...
JODIE
How long did you do it?

Um... when I was cast in ‘87 until

Did you ever want to get married?
SHELLY
I was married for a short time when 
I was really young.
JODIE
What happened?
SHELLY
Oh you know, it didn’t work out-- I 
was dancing-- I was already in the 
show here when we met, and he 
didn’t like it so much-- Vegas. And 
then he got a job in New York, but 
the show here was really thriving-- 
there was a lot of press around us-- 
it was so exciting and I was very 
young-- so I stayed here.
JODIE
So what did you do?
SHELLY
We tried to make it work for a 
couple years but he eventually met 
someone there. He asked me if I’d 
consider trying to dance in New 
York, and I did-- I tried it. 
I went to an open call for the 
Rockettes, I went to an open call 
for a Broadway musical, but... I 
really, I just missed the thrill of 
the show here...
JODIE
You’d be a perfect Rockette.
SHELLY
Nah, I found all that kicking very 
redundant.
Jodie smiles, sensitive to Shelly’s rationalization. They 
look out at the mountains.

same time-- Hannie-- haha-- anyway, 
Hi Hannah, honey.
(abandoning the grill)
Just wanted to check in and say 
hello and see if you’d want to meet 
me for a bite or a cup of coffee-- 
or well, I don’t drink coffee but I 
could have some tea-- or, what I’d 
really like is a nice drink but 
that’s... that’d be inappropriate 
‘cause you’re only... you’re not 
old enou-- you’re only twenty... oh 
shit. Oh shit, you’re twenty two-- 
oh my god, how do I delete this 
thing...?

SHELLY
You did? Already?
MARY-ANNE
What’d you go out for? 
JODIE
Um, it was this show called 
Hedonist Paradise?

Ugh, I can’t believe that’s the 
title of a show.
MARY-ANNE
What, like Le Razzle Dazzle is

SHELLY
Le Razzle Dazzle is a name that is 
evocative of-- of another time in 
history, of Paris, of the theater 
in a way--

SHELLY
Well what do you get from “Hedonist 
Paradise”? I get girls grinding on 
poles, doused in water-- like 
animals--just totally tasteless--
MARY-ANNE
Tasteless--
SHELLY
Yes!
MARY-ANNE
I can’t have this conversation 
again--
SHELLY
Well, Mary-Anne, you think it’s so 
terrible, why are you here? Why did 
you want this job in the first 
place you think it’s so tasteless?
MARY-ANNE
Because it’s a job! It pays in 
American dollars.

I don’t know.
This hangs in the air...

MARY-ANNE
Sure.
Jodie adjusts her chair.
SHELLY
Oh there’s a chair involved.
JODIE
Okay so you’re backward on the 
chair and then you’re like:
(she talk-sings to a tune 
akin to S&M by Rihanna)
“A git it git it come on.” Slap 
thighs, up the body, through the

EDDIE
Oh hey, Shell--
He hands her a paycheck envelope. 
SHELLY
Thanks.

Since we lost those shows, these 
checks feel like they’re getting 
slimmer and slimmer, you know?
EDDIE
Yeah.
Shelly looks at the check, concerned. Eddie heads out.
SHELLY
Hey Eddie? Are you sure this is 
right? It’s less than I thought it 
would be.
EDDIE
Well it’s less because less shows. 
SHELLY
(checking her irritation)
Well, I know that, obviously, but I 
thought it would just be eight 
hundred divided by eleven shows a 
week, minus the three shows we 
lost.
EDDIE
You might have been making slightly 
more for the ones we lost cuz those 
shows were better sold. Generally.

locker room and the vibe is totally different than the 
dressing rooms at Le Razzle Dazzle. 
ANNETTE
I think you want a man around the

in town for like two nights max at

Jodie, in the audience, laughs hysterically at a funny, sexy 
FEMALE PLATE SPINNER as she spins multiple plates on sticks 
in front of the curtain. 
Her grand finale: She sits on a chair, straddles her legs and 
inserts a stick into her vagina. She spins a plate on it,

And just like the shows in Paris-- 
you know, we think 85 is a big 
cast, but there were 160 of us back 
in the ‘80’s! American Express did 
a travel campaign in -- in ‘87 or 
‘88, and we were flown all over the

sites-- They shot me on the Great 
Wall of China-- I was very 
special!!

The Iconic American Show Girl. The 
Las Vegas Showgirl. We were 
ambassadors, we represented 
elegance and grace, we had status, 
It was a real legacy, and it still 
is! I mean, these costumes-- they 
make you feel like you’re stepping

She runs out, leaving Hannah devastated as the door closes 
behind her. Hannah takes a moment to process and compose 
herself. She glances around the dressing room and notices the 
old photo of herself and Shelly taped to Shelly’s mirror. She 
takes it down and looks at it.
Eddie opens the door halfway and shuts the lights off.
HANNAH
Hey-- I’m still here--
EDDIE
Oh hey, sorry. Thought I saw Shelly 
go...
Eddie realizes that it’s Hannah standing in front of him.
HANNAH
Um-- I’m going-- sorry.
She tapes the photo back to the mirror.
EDDIE
It’s okay. Are you... Hannah?
HANNAH
Yeah-- I know I probably shouldn’t 
be back here--
EDDIE
You came to see the show?
HANNAH
Um... yeah.

Hannah looks at him.
HANNAH
Yeah. ...I think I should get going.
Hannah starts for the door.
EDDIE
Yeah. Sorry to keep you. It’s

A moment.
EDDIE (CONT'D)

It’s good seeing you.
HANNAH
You too.
After a second, Hannah leaves.
INT. SHELLY’S HOUSE. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Shelly practices her dance, making notes. The doorbell RINGS. 
Shelly opens the door, and standing there is Jodie, looking 
miserable and fragile. Shelly’s immediately on edge.
SHELLY
Hey sweetie. What are you doing 
here?
JODIE
I just... I just wanted to come 
over...?
SHELLY
Okay...
JODIE
Can I come in?

JODIE
It’s just-- my mom-- She won’t 
answer my calls-- and I want to 
talk to her?
SHELLY
Your mom’s just sad that you left 
like that. You left.
JODIE
(surprised by Shelly’s 
lack of care)
I know but I still want to talk to 
her--
SHELLY
You know what, it’s just a bad time 
right now-- 
JODIE
Shelly, I’m really scared-- I 
didn’t know I could never go back--
SHELLY
I CAN’T SEE YOU RIGHT NOW! I need 
you to go, I need to be alone, I’m 
doing something!
Shelly shuts the door hard in Jodie’s face. Looking like 
she’s about to crumble, Jodie backs up and walks away.
EXT. LE RAZZLE DAZZLE. ROOFTOP - EVENING
Shelly, in full costume and make-up, is on her phone. The 
feathers and rhinestones of her costume, her enormous fake 
eyelashes, caked on foundation, and crusty red lipstick-- all 
still strikingly contrary to the sky and purple mountains 
behind her. 
SHELLY
I just wanted to call you-- I want 
to talk to you-- I can’t believe I 
left the way I did the other night, 
I just feel so terrible.

INT. LE RAZZLE DAZZLE. DRESSING ROOM - LATER
Mary-Anne, Jodie and the other dancers mid-fast-costume￾change. Shelly enters last.
SHELLY
Is this the worst audience ever?? I 
just want to yell at them: WAKE UP! 
This is a LIVE PERFORMANCE! What is 
this boring? It’s breasts and 
rhinestones and joy! 
JODIE
How did you do this before I was 
here? For thirty years-- how did 
you make all your quick changes??
SHELLY
I’m so glad you feel so necessary 
here, Jodie-- that’s good. That’s 
important.
JODIE
(re: the music)
Do you hear where we’re at? 
They listen to the monitor-- it’s like ridiculous climactic 
movie music. Shelly starts changing.
SHELLY
Can you help me with my necklace?
JODIE
No, I want to see you get ready by 
yourself. I want to see what would 
happen to you if I didn’t help.

the infamous DOOR HANDLE and RIPS.

Jodie looks back, instantly guilty, seeing that Shelly isn’t 
going on with them as she crumbles to the floor, looking at 
her ripped wing like it’s a dying child.
MARY-ANNE
...Jodie, we have to go.
Mary-Anne shoves Jodie as they head for the stage.
MARY-ANNE (CONT'D)
You’re a real asshole, you know 
that?
INT. LE RAZZLE DAZZLE. DRESSING ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT
Shelly is alone in the dressing room after the show, sewing 
up the ripped wing. Eddie comes in.
EDDIE
You want me to have Ida take a look 
at that?
SHELLY
No, God no, they’ll dock me again.
EDDIE
How long you think you’re gonna be?

You’re not in her life so I don’t 
see how it’s any of your business.

She was best friends with Becky and 
Theo, and Lisa had all the time in 
the world to devote to her kids, 
so, you know--

You couldn’t have gotten a sitter?
SHELLY
I made it work, that’s all that 
matters-- 
EDDIE
Or I was thinking... you could’a 
gotten job where you worked when 
she was at school. You didn’t have 
to stay with the show.

powerful and I can’t imagine my life

you’re-- you, Eddie, are going on to 
this show or that show and the

Shelly changes into her dance clothes. She pins a number onto 
her leotard. 
INT. THEATER. HOLDING ROOM - A FEW MINUTES LATER
Shelly finds a seat amongst a spattering of alternative 
PERFORMERS. She passes a jaded looking sword swallower, 
polishing her sword, tatted up contortionists stretching, a 
group of men wearing puppet costumes, bored, looking at their 
smartphones, a Russian couple in roller skates. It’s the 
stuff of freak shows. The LEAST GLAMOROUS scene ever.

SHADOWS OF THE NIGHT by Pat Benatar plays and Shelly begins 
dancing. This is the interpretive dance she’s been rehearsing 
at home and in the dressing room. We finally see how 
passionate Shelly is when she’s dancing even though her 
technique is not great. 
Shelly pours her heart out on the stage, leaving everything 
she’s got on the dance floor. She’s dancing from her heart 
and living in and for this moment, her artist soul soaring 
with self-expression. This is Shelly’s Moment.
The dance ends and Shelly feels triumphant. She’s breathing 
hard, proud of herself. She's done just what she came to do.

SHELLY
Hey, please, I worked really hard--
DIRECTOR
Look, if you were a really good 
dancer, it might be different, but 
your technique isn’t great. You 
were obviously hired for Le Razzle 
Dazzle because you were beautiful 
and young, not because you were a 
brilliant dancer. I mean, that’s 
not news, is it? If you had great 
training, if you had been with a 
company in New York, maybe you’d 
have more of an argument here, but 
you’ve been in that show for how 
long? They hired you because you 
were young and sexy. I don’t know 
how to help you if you don’t 
understand that’s not what you’re 
selling anymore.
Shelly doesn’t know how to respond.

Thank you for coming in. Next!!
In the wings, Mary-Anne, who’s heard the whole thing, watches, 
unsure what to do.
Shelly defiantly starts doing a dance that’s like the one 
Jodie did in her Hedonist Paradise audition.

I’m not going home!!
Shelly slams closed her car door and peels out of the parking 
spot.

INT. LE RAZZLE DAZZLE. BACKSTAGE - LATER
Shelly tears through the deserted backstage area, making a 
bee-line for the dressing room.
INT. LE RAZZLE DAZZLE. DRESSING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Shelly enters and heads for her costume rack. She pulls the 
FAIRY BALLET COSTUME she was sewing earlier off the rack, and 
RIPS IT IN HALF, THEN RIPS IT AGAIN AND AGAIN UNTIL IT’S IN 
SHREDS ON THE FLOOR. She sinks down to the floor, weeping.
INT. LE RAZZLE DAZZLE. DRESSING ROOM - LATER, PRE-SHOW
Shelly, calmer now, is still sitting underneath the costume 
rack, looking at the shreds in her hands. Mary-Anne walks in 
with her dance bag. She puts her bag at her station and sits 
down on the floor next to Shelly. 
SHELLY
...I thought it was so special... 
But I just... I missed out...
Shelly sniffles and Mary-Anne grabs a tissue box off a 
dressing station.
SHELLY (CONT'D)
And at the same time... I can’t 
believe this is over... 
MARY-ANNE
It’s special that you were with the 
show longer than anybody...
SHELLY
...I just loved that feeling...
Mary-Anne understands. They sit in silence for a moment as a 
couple of other DANCERS trickle in. They notice Shelly and 
Mary-Anne sitting under the costumes but don’t say anything, 
they just go about their business.
MARY-ANNE
(re: fairy costume shreds)
You really screwed this thing up.
Shelly laughs, bittersweet.
Jodie enters with her dance bag. She sees Shelly and Mary￾Anne beneath the costume rack with the shreds in hand, 
looking somber. She joins them on the floor.

JODIE
What did you do??
SHELLY
(emotional again)
I ripped it up.
Jodie puts her hands on Shelly and Mary-Anne’s knees.
SHELLY (CONT'D)
I had this dream the other night 
that I could speak French... I was 
really-- I was speaking French. 
Really speaking it. And I-- I 
understood everything...
JODIE
You should go to France.
SHELLY
Ha! Yeah, maybe I should...
MARY-ANNE
...Maybe I should go to California.
SHELLY
Oh you should. You should! 
MARY-ANNE
I dunno...
SHELLY
Really! What’s stopping you? You 
should do it, you should.
Shelly studies Mary-Anne who looks down into her hands. Then 
Mary-Anne starts to cry.
MARY-ANNE
(trying to laugh it off)
I don’t know what’s wrong with me.
She grabs a tissue from the box. Shelly puts her arm around 
Mary-Anne who starts to weep into Shelly’s shoulder.
SHELLY
(comforting her)
The next chapter will be different.
MARY-ANNE
...M-hm.
Jodie bursts into tears too. They all laugh a little in spite 
of themselves. Mary-Anne wipes Jodie’s face, lovingly.

Dummy. 
They sit there in each others arms for a few moments.
INT. LE RAZZLE DAZZLE. EDDIE'S OFFICE - NIGHT
Eddie turns on the PA.
EDDIE
Places please. This is your places 
call for the last time.
PRE-LAP: A cork popping.
INT. LE RAZZLE DAZZLE. BACKSTAGE - NIGHT
Mary-Anne, Jodie and all the other DANCERS, all in costumes, 
with hair and make-up done, gather around Shelly.
SHELLY
To the very last showgirls!
DANCERS
To the last showgirls!
They sip. The PA system turns on.
EDDIE (V.O.)
Places please, this is your places 
call. For the last time, this is 
your places call for the final 
performance of Le Razzle Dazzle.
Hoots and hollers go up in the bustling dressing room.
INT. LE RAZZLE DAZZLE. BACKSTAGE - A FEW MINUTES LATER
Hannah makes her way through the labyrinth-like backstage 
area toward the stage. She’s like a fish swimming upstream 
through the throngs of costumed women and men, searching for 
Shelly. She’s holding her camera. She finally spots Shelly.
HANNAH
Mom!
Shelly turns and sees her. She takes a breath.
SHELLY
Hannah.

Hannah smiles and Shelly’s heart fills with unmitigated joy.
SHELLY (CONT'D)
What are you doing here?
Hannah smiles at Shelly with love and understanding. Shelly 
smiles back. Inside, her heart is singing.
INT. LE RAZZLE DAZZLE. BACKSTAGE - NIGHT
Eddie is at his station, headphones on. We see the glow of 
the stage lights, and hear the music. Shelly, in a massive 
headdress and her spectacular rhinestoned and feathered grand 
finale costume, approaches him.
SHELLY
...Hey.
Eddie looks up from his script.
EDDIE
Hi Shell.
SHELLY
You’re lucky, you’re probably never 
gonna leave this theater, huh?
EDDIE
(laughs a little)
Maybe not-- that’s-- you’re 
probably right-- probably not.
SHELLY
One day your ghost will probably 
haunt this theater.
EDDIE
Ha-- I never thought about that.
SHELLY
...I can’t believe this is gonna be 
my last time setting foot on that 
stage...
She looks out at the stage through the wings.
SHELLY (CONT'D)
...I’m gonna go to Hannah’s 
graduation. Was thinking about 
maybe even moving there...
EDDIE
Oh... wow--

SHELLY
...But Annette also said she could 
help me get a job cocktailing...
EDDIE
Cute outfits.
SHELLY
(laughs a little)
Not quite like this one...
The lights shift and the finale music begins.
EDDIE
One last chance to give ‘em hell.
SHELLY
Ha.
She takes her place in the wing, ready for her entrance.
EDDIE
Shelly?
She looks back at him.
EDDIE (CONT'D)
You look great, Shell.
INT. LE RAZZLE DAZZLE. STAGE - CONTINUOUS
THE GRAND FINALE. 
For the first time, we witness the full spectacle of LE 
RAZZLE DAZZLE. 
A spotlight sweeps across the stage, finding Shelly and the 
dancers, all adorned like peacocks in a million dollars worth 
of rippling feathers and dazzling, gleaming rhinestones. Even 
their teeth look like they’re glittering.
The audience is completely PACKED: smiling, rapt, erupting 
with cheers and applause.
SHELLY IS FRONT AND CENTER: an absolute beacon of ageless 
beauty, she belongs right here, radiating grace and charm, 
every move showcasing her passion and years of dedication. 
We witness that feeling she has spoken of: being seen, the 
intoxication of recognition, being celebrated, the 
electrifying energy of a thousand lights bathing her in 
glory. In this moment, she is an iconic American legend: The 
Great American Showgirl.

We catch glimpses of Jodie and Mary-Anne, along with the 
ensemble, each of them joyful as they share in their final 
performance. 
As the performance ends, the dancers strike their final 
poses, and the audience leaps to their feet. CONFETTI 
explodes overhead, BALLOONS cascade from the rafters, and 
Shelly is filled with the powerful affirmation of the life 
she has lived right here on this stage: one filled with 
passion, acceptance, and the unique, fabled mark she leaves 
behind on the legacy of American beauty.
CLOSE IN on Shelly, breathing hard, smiling a thousand watts, 
a euphoric, glorious death.
FADE TO BLACK.
THE END.
